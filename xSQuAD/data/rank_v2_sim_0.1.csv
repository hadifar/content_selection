0,"Hoover ’ s other attempt at federal assistance also occurred in 1932 , when he endorsed a bill by Senator Robert Wagner of New York . This was the Emergency Relief and Construction Act . This act authorized the RFC to expand beyond loans to financial institutions and allotted $ 1.5 billion to states to fund local public works projects . This program failed to deliver the kind of help needed , however , as Hoover severely limited the types of projects it could fund to those that were ultimately self-paying ( such as toll bridges and public housing ) and those that required skilled workers . While well intended , these programs maintained the status quo , and there was still no direct federal relief to the individuals who so desperately needed it .",1.0218443870544434,0.0,"[1.0, 1.6398747134950554e-36]"
0,"As conditions worsened , however , Hoover eventually relaxed his opposition to federal relief and formed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) in 1932 , in part because it was an election year and Hoover hoped to keep his office . Although not a form of direct relief to the American people in greatest need , the RFC was much larger in scope than any preceding effort , setting aside $ 2 billion in taxpayer money to rescue banks , credit unions , and insurance companies . The goal was to boost confidence in the nation ’ s financial institutions by ensuring that they were on solid footing . This model was flawed on a number of levels . First , the program only lent money to banks with sufficient collateral , which meant that most of the aid went to large banks . In fact , of the first $ 61 million loaned , $ 41 million went to just three banks . Small town and rural banks got almost nothing . Furthermore , at this time , confidence in financial institutions was not the primary concern of most Americans . They needed food and jobs . Many had no money to put into the banks , no matter how confident they were that the banks were safe .",1.0040425062179563,0.0,"[1.0, 3.874709644208494e-14]"
0,"Although it was a relatively quiet period for U . S . diplomacy , Hoover did help to usher in a period of positive relations , specifically with several Latin American neighbors . This would establish the basis for Franklin Roosevelt ’ s “ Good Neighbor ” policy . After a goodwill tour of Central American countries immediately following his election in 1928 , Hoover shaped the subsequent Clark Memorandum — released in 1930 — which largely repudiated the previous Roosevelt Corollary , establishing a basis for unlimited American military intervention throughout Latin America . To the contrary , through the memorandum , Hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older Monroe Doctrine , in which the U . S . pledged assistance to her Latin American neighbors should any European powers interfere in Western Hemisphere affairs . Hoover further strengthened relations to the south by withdrawing American troops from Haiti and Nicaragua . Additionally , he outlined with Secretary of State Henry Stimson the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine , which announced that the United States would never recognize claims to territories seized by force ( a direct response to the recent Japanese invasion of Manchuria ) . Other diplomatic overtures met with less success for Hoover . Most notably , in an effort to support the American economy during the early stages of the Depression , the president signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930 . The law , which raised tariffs on thousands of imports , was intended to increase sales of American-made goods , but predictably angered foreign trade partners who in turn raised their tariffs on American imports , thus shrinking international trade and closing additional markets to desperate American manufacturers . As a result , the global depression worsened further . A similar attempt to spur the world economy , known as the Hoover Moratorium , likewise met with great opposition and little economic benefit . Issued in 1931 , the moratorium called for a halt to World War I reparations to be paid by Germany to France , as well as forgiveness of Allied war debts to the U . S .",0.9966303706169128,1.0,"[1.0, 1.5688711476586204e-55]"
0,"Farmers also organized and protested , often violently . The most notable example was the Farm Holiday Association . Led by Milo Reno , this organization held significant sway among farmers in Iowa , Nebraska , Wisconsin , Minnesota , and the Dakotas . Although they never comprised a majority of farmers in any of these states , their public actions drew press attention nationwide . Among their demands , the association sought a federal government plan to set agricultural prices artificially high enough to cover the farmers ’ costs , as well as a government commitment to sell any farm surpluses on the world market . To achieve their goals , the group called for farm holidays , during which farmers would neither sell their produce nor purchase any other goods until the government met their demands . However , the greatest strength of the association came from the unexpected and seldom-planned actions of its members , which included barricading roads into markets , attacking nonmember farmers , and destroying their produce . Some members even raided small town stores , destroying produce on the shelves . Members also engaged in “ penny auctions , ” bidding pennies on foreclosed farm land and threatening any potential buyers with bodily harm if they competed in the sale . Once they won the auction , the association returned the land to the original owner . In Iowa , farmers threatened to hang a local judge if he signed any more farm foreclosures . At least one death occurred as a direct result of these protests before they waned following the election of Franklin Roosevelt .",0.9956031441688538,0.0,"[2.674239350729807e-74, 1.0]"

0,"In keeping with these principles , Hoover ’ s response to the crash focused on two very common American traditions : He asked individuals to tighten their belts and work harder , and he asked the business community to voluntarily help sustain the economy by retaining workers and continuing production . He immediately summoned a conference of leading industrialists to meet in Washington , DC , urging them to maintain their current wages while America rode out this brief economic panic . The crash , he assured business leaders , was not part of a greater downturn ; they had nothing to worry about . Similar meetings with utility companies and railroad executives elicited promises for billions of dollars in new construction projects , while labor leaders agreed to withhold demands for wage increases and workers continued to labor . Hoover also persuaded Congress to pass a $ 160 million tax cut to bolster American incomes , leading many to conclude that the president was doing all he could to stem the tide of the panic . In April 1930 , the New York Times editorial board concluded that “ No one in his place could have done more . ” However , these modest steps were not enough . By late 1931 , when it became clear that the economy would not improve on its own , Hoover recognized the need for some government intervention . He created the President ’ s Emergency Committee for Employment ( PECE ) , later renamed the President ’ s Organization of Unemployment Relief ( POUR ) . In keeping with Hoover ’ s distaste of what he viewed as handouts , this organization did not provide direct federal relief to people in need . Instead , it assisted state and private relief agencies , such as the Red Cross , Salvation Army , YMCA , and Community Chest . Hoover also strongly urged people of means to donate funds to help the poor , and he himself gave significant private donations to worthy causes . But these private efforts could not alleviate the widespread effects of poverty . Congress pushed for a more direct government response to the hardship . In 1930 – 1931 , it attempted to pass a $ 60 million bill to provide relief to drought victims by allowing them access to food , fertilizer , and animal feed . Hoover stood fast in his refusal to provide food , resisting any element of direct relief . The final bill of $ 47 million provided for everything except food but did not come close to adequately addressing the crisis . Again in 1931 , Congress proposed the Federal Emergency Relief Bill , which would have provided $ 375 million to states to help provide food , clothing , and shelter to the homeless . But Hoover opposed the bill , stating that it ruined the balance of power between states and the federal government , and in February 1932 , it was defeated by fourteen votes . However , the president ’ s adamant opposition to direct-relief federal government programs should not be viewed as one of indifference or uncaring toward the suffering American people . His personal sympathy for those in need was boundless . Hoover was one of only two presidents to reject his salary for the office he held . Throughout the Great Depression , he donated an average of $ 25,000 annually to various relief organizations to assist in their efforts . Furthermore , he helped to raise $ 500,000 in private funds to support the White House Conference on Child Health and Welfare in 1930 . Rather than indifference or heartlessness , Hoover ’ s steadfast adherence to a philosophy of individualism as the path toward long-term American recovery explained many of his policy decisions . “ A voluntary deed , ” he repeatedly commented , “ is infinitely more precious to our national ideal and spirit than a thousand-fold poured from the Treasury . ”",0.986662745475769,1.0,"[1.0, 2.2090057080354322e-39]"

0,"To understand the crash , it is useful to address the decade that preceded it . The prosperous 1920s ushered in a feeling of euphoria among middle-class and wealthy Americans , and people began to speculate on wilder investments . The government was a willing partner in this endeavor : The Federal Reserve followed a brief postwar recession in 1920 – 1921 with a policy of setting interest rates artificially low , as well as easing the reserve requirements on the nation ’ s largest banks . As a result , the money supply in the U . S . increased by nearly 60 percent , which convinced even more Americans of the safety of investing in questionable schemes . They felt that prosperity was boundless and that extreme risks were likely tickets to wealth . Named for Charles Ponzi , the original “ Ponzi schemes ” emerged early in the 1920s to encourage novice investors to divert funds to unfounded ventures , which in reality simply used new investors ’ funds to pay off older investors as the schemes grew in size . Speculation , where investors purchased into high-risk schemes that they hoped would pay off quickly , became the norm . Several banks , including deposit institutions that originally avoided investment loans , began to offer easy credit , allowing people to invest , even when they lacked the money to do so . An example of this mindset was the Florida land boom of the 1920s : Real estate developers touted Florida as a tropical paradise and investors went all in , buying land they had never seen with money they didn ’ t have and selling it for even higher prices .",0.9774889945983888,0.0,"[3.599688530615969e-66, 1.0]"

By the 1932 election , hitchhikers held up signs reading : “ If you don ’ t give me a ride , I ’ ll vote for Hoover . ” Americans did not necessarily believe that Hoover caused the Great Depression .

0,"As the effects of the Great Depression worsened , wealthier Americans had particular concern for “ the deserving poor ” — those who had lost all of their money due to no fault of their own . This concept gained greater attention beginning in the Progressive Era of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , when early social reformers sought to improve the quality of life for all Americans by addressing the poverty that was becoming more prevalent , particularly in emerging urban areas . By the time of the Great Depression , social reformers and humanitarian agencies had determined that the “ deserving poor ” belonged to a different category from those who had speculated and lost . However , the sheer volume of Americans who fell into this group meant that charitable assistance could not begin to reach them all . Some fifteen million “ deserving poor , ” or a full one-third of the labor force , were struggling by 1932 .

With the effects of the drought and low commodity prices , farmers could not pay their local banks , which in turn lacked funds to pay the large urban banks . Ultimately , the large banks foreclosed on the farms , often swallowing up the small country banks in the process .

As the federal government continued to purchase all excess produce for the war effort , farmers and ranchers fell into several bad practices , including mortgaging their farms and borrowing money against future production in order to expand . However , after the war , prosperity rapidly dwindled , particularly during the recession of 1921 . Seeking to recoup their losses through economies of scale in which they would expand their production even further to take full advantage of their available land and machinery , farmers plowed under native grasses to plant acre after acre of wheat , with little regard for the long-term repercussions to the soil . Regardless of these misguided efforts , commodity prices continued to drop , finally plummeting in 1929 , when the price of wheat dropped from two dollars to forty cents per bushel .",0.3715648055076599,0.0,"[7.284187518131226e-74, 1.0]"

Radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine , whose enormously popular essay Common Sense was first published in January 1776 , advocated a republic : a state without a king .

In the late eighteenth century , republics were few and far between .

Medicalization and demedicalization affect who responds to the patient , how people respond to the patient , and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient ( Conrad and Schneider 1992 ) .",1.0130798816680908,1.0,"[1.0, 6.859395649587557e-86, 1.705483795040709e-75]"
2,"According to the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , the most common mental disorders in the United States are anxiety disorders . Almost 18 percent of American adults are likely to be affected in a single year , and 28 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) . It is important to distinguish between occasional feelings of anxiety and a true anxiety disorder . Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point , but anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time .

2,"Another fairly commonly diagnosed mental disorder is Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , which statistics suggest affects nine percent of children and eight percent of adults on a lifetime basis ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) . ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders , and it is marked by difficulty paying attention , difficulty controlling behavior , and hyperactivity . According to the American Psychological Association ( APA ) , ADHD responds positively to stimulant drugs like Ritalin , which helps people stay focused . However , there is some social debate over whether such drugs are being overprescribed ( American Psychological Association ) . In fact , some critics question whether this disorder is really as widespread as it seems , or if it is a case of overdiagnosis . Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) have gained a lot of attention in recent years . The term ASD encompasses a group of developmental brain disorders that are characterized by “ deficits in social interaction , verbal and nonverbal communication , and engagement in repetitive behaviors or interests ” ( National Institute of Mental Health ) . As with the personality disorders described above , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders ’ description of these is in the process of being revised . The National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) distinguishes between serious mental illness and other disorders . The key feature of serious mental illness is that it results in “ serious functional impairment , which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities ” ( National Institute of Mental Health ) . Thus , the characterization of “ serious ” refers to the effect of the illness ( functional impairment ) , not the illness itself . Although the view is not widely held , there are some researchers who argue that mental illness is a myth . For example , to Thomas Scheff ( 1963 ) , residual deviance — a violation of social norms not covered by any specific behavioral expectation — is what actually results in people being labeled mentally ill . In The Myth of Mental Illness : Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct ( 1961 ) , Thomas Szasz asks if there is such a thing as mental illness , and then argues that there is not . Rather , mental illness is a deviation from what others view as normal , with no basis in biological disease .

In the DSM-IV , personality disorders represent “ an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the culture of the individual who exhibits it ” ( National Institute of Mental Health ) . In other words , personality disorders cause people to behave in ways that are seen as abnormal to society but seem normal to them . The DSM-V proposes broadening this definition by offering five broad personality trait domains to describe personality disorders , some related to the level or type of their disconnect with society .

Drunks were not treated in a sympathetic way because , at that time , it was thought that it was their own fault that they could not stop drinking .

Sociologists Conrad and Barker ( 2010 ) offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the major findings of the last 50 years of development in this concept .

2,"We can see an example of institutionalized sexism in the way that women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with certain kinds of mental disorders . Psychologist Dana Becker notes that 75 percent of all diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD ) are for women according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . This diagnosis is characterized by instability of identity , of mood , and of behavior , and Becker argues that it has been used as a catch-all diagnosis for too many women . She further decries the pejorative connotation of the diagnosis , saying that it predisposes many people , both within and outside of the profession of psychotherapy , against women who have been so diagnosed ( Becker ) . Many critics also point to the medicalization of women ’ s issues as an example of institutionalized sexism . Medicalization refers to the process by which previously normal aspects of life are redefined as deviant and needing medical attention to remedy . Historically and contemporaneously , many aspects of women ’ s lives have been medicalized , including menstruation , pre-menstrual syndrome , pregnancy , childbirth , and menopause . The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth has been particularly contentious in recent decades , with many women opting against the medical process and choosing a more natural childbirth . Fox and Worts ( 1999 ) find that all women experience pain and anxiety during the birth process , but that social support relieves both as effectively as medical support . In other words , medical interventions are no more effective than social ones at helping with the difficulties of pain and childbirth . Fox and Worts further found that women with supportive partners ended up with less medical intervention and fewer cases of postpartum depression . Of course , access to quality birth care outside of the standard medical models may not be readily available to women of all social classes .",0.2071101367473602,1.0,"[2.2849523438026974e-53, 1.0, 1.5856254656345612e-45]"

As children grow into teenagers , this process continues . Peer groups are important to adolescents in a new way , as they begin to develop an identity separate from their parents and exert independence . Additionally , peer groups provide their own opportunities for socialization since kids usually engage in different types of activities with their peers than they do with their families .

3,"Moral development is an important part of the socialization process . The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a smoothly functioning society . Moral development prevents people from acting on unchecked urges , instead considering what is right for society and good for others . Lawrence Kohlberg ( 1927 – 1987 ) was interested in how people learn to decide what is right and what is wrong . To understand this topic , he developed a theory of moral development that includes three levels : preconventional , conventional , and postconventional . In the preconventional stage , young children , who lack a higher level of cognitive ability , experience the world around them only through their senses . It isn ’ t until the teen years that the conventional theory develops , when youngsters become increasingly aware of others ’ feelings and take those into consideration when determining what ’ s “ good ” and “ bad . ” The final stage , called postconventional , is when people begin to think of morality in abstract terms , such as Americans believing that everyone has the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . At this stage , people also recognize that legality and morality do not always match up evenly ( Kohlberg 1981 ) . When hundreds of thousands of Egyptians turned out in 2011 to protest government corruption , they were using postconventional morality . They understood that although their government was legal , it was not morally correct .",1.0131070613861084,1.0,"[1.0, 2.840648303015532e-25]"

This may be because working-class parents have less education and more repetitive-task jobs for which the ability to follow rules and to conform helps . Wealthy parents tend to have better educations and often work in managerial positions or in careers that require creative problem solving , so they teach their children behaviors that would be beneficial in these positions . This means that children are effectively socialized and raised to take the types of jobs that their parents already have , thus reproducing the class system ( Kohn 1977 ) .

The case of Danielle , for example , illustrates what happens when social interaction is absent from early experience : she had no ability to see herself as others would see her . From Mead ’ s point of view , she had no “ self . ” How do we get from being newborns to being humans with “ selves ? ” Mead believed that there is a specific path of development that all people go through . During the preparatory stage , children are only capable of imitation : they have no ability to imagine how others see things . They copy the actions of people with whom they regularly interact , such as their mothers and fathers . This is followed by the play stage , during which children begin to take on the role that one other person might have . Thus , children might try on a parent ’ s point of view by acting out “ grownup ” behavior , like playing “ dress up ” and acting out the “ mom ” role , or talking on a toy telephone the way they see their father do .",0.9949181079864502,0.0,"[1.0, 3.949176540964923e-36]"

It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to accept society ’ s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values . Socialization is not the same as socializing ( interacting with others , like family , friends , and coworkers ); to be precise , it is a sociological process that occurs through socializing . As Danielle ’ s story illustrates , even the most basic of human activities are learned . You may be surprised to know that even physical tasks like sitting , standing , and walking had not automatically developed for Danielle as she grew . And without socialization , Danielle hadn ’ t learned about the material culture of her society ( the tangible objects a culture uses ): for example , she couldn ’ t hold a spoon , bounce a ball , or use a chair for sitting . She also hadn ’ t learned its nonmaterial culture , such as its beliefs , values , and norms . She had no understanding of the concept of “ family , ” didn ’ t know cultural expectations for using a bathroom for elimination , and had no sense of modesty . Most importantly , she hadn ’ t learned to use the symbols that make up language — through which we learn about who we are , how we fit with other people , and the natural and social worlds in which we live . Sociologists have long been fascinated by circumstances like Danielle ’ s — in which a child receives sufficient human support to survive , but virtually no social interaction — because they highlight how much we depend on social interaction to provide the information and skills that we need to be part of society or even to develop a “ self . ”",0.993571400642395,1.0,"[2.2298437679714577e-43, 1.0]"

Without socialization , a society ’ s culture would perish as members died off .

One effective strategy is the foot-in-the-door technique ( Cialdini , 2001 ; Pliner , Hart , Kohl , & Saari , 1974 ) . Using the foot-in-the-door technique , the persuader gets a person to agree to bestow a small favor or to buy a small item , only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item . The foot-in-the-door technique was demonstrated in a study by Freedman and Fraser ( 1966 ) in which participants who agreed to post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put a large sign in their yard than people who declined the first request ( Figure 12.16 ) . Research on this technique also illustrates the principle of consistency ( Cialdini , 2001 ): Our past behavior often directs our future behavior , and we have a desire to maintain consistency once we have a committed to a behavior . A common application of foot-in-the-door is when teens ask their parents for a small permission ( for example , extending curfew by a half hour ) and then asking them for something larger .

4,"The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ) . Instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’ s quality , the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement . For example , having a popular athlete advertise athletic shoes is a common method used to encourage young adults to purchase the shoes . This route to attitude change does not require much effort or information processing . This method of persuasion may promote positivity toward the message or product , but it typically results in less permanent attitude or behavior change . The audience does not need to be analytical or motivated to process the message .

People often view gender groups as being fundamentally different from each other in personality traits , characteristics , social roles , and interests . Because we often feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in-groups , we develop in-group bias : a preference for our own group over other groups .

For example , if the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess , no homework , or candy , once a few children vote , the rest will comply and go with the majority . In a different classroom , the majority might vote differently , and most of the children would comply with that majority .

4,"Behavior is a product of both the situation ( e . g . , cultural influences , social roles , and the presence of bystanders ) and of the person ( e . g . , personality characteristics ) . Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one influence or behavior over others . Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings . In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) . An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament . Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective , whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective . Modern approaches to social psychology , however , take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior ( Fiske , Gilbert , & Lindzey , 2010 ) . In fact , the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study the complex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior ( Mischel , 1977 ; Richard , Bond , & Stokes-Zoota , 2003 ) .",1.011756181716919,0.0,"[9.168453100981046e-96, 2.6968184934182826e-54, 8.821652626672231e-46, 1.0]"

Skilled basketball players will be more likely to make a free throw basket when surrounded by a cheering audience than when playing alone in the gym ( Figure 12.21 ) . However , there are instances when even skilled athletes can have difficulty under pressure . For example , if an athlete is less skilled or nervous about making a free throw , having an audience may actually hinder rather than help .

4,"Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex . Typically , sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women , but either sex can show sexism toward their own or their opposite sex . Like racism , sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect . Common forms of sexism in modern society include gender role expectations , such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household . Sexism also includes people ’ s expectations for how members of a gender group should behave . For example , women are expected to be friendly , passive , and nurturing , and when women behave in an unfriendly , assertive , or neglectful manner they often are disliked for violating their gender role ( Rudman , 1998 ) . Research by Laurie Rudman ( 1998 ) finds that when female job applicants self-promote , they are likely to be viewed as competent , but they may be disliked and are less likely to be hired because they violated gender expectations for modesty . Sexism can exist on a societal level such as in hiring , employment opportunities , and education . Women are less likely to be hired or promoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering , aviation , and construction ( Figure 12.23 ) ( Blau , Ferber , & Winkler , 2010 ; Ceci & Williams , 2011 ) .

4,"Researchers have documented several characteristics in men and women that humans find attractive . First we look for friends and lovers who are physically attractive . People differ in what they consider attractive , and attractiveness is culturally influenced . Research , however , suggests that some universally attractive features in women include large eyes , high cheekbones , a narrow jaw line , a slender build ( Buss , 1989 ) , and a lower waist-to-hip ratio ( Singh , 1993 ) . For men , attractive traits include being tall , having broad shoulders , and a narrow waist ( Buss , 1989 ) . Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered more attractive than asymmetric individuals ( Fink , Neave , Manning , & Grammer , 2006 ; Penton-Voak et al . , 2001 ; Rikowski & Grammer , 1999 ) . Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth , affection , and social skills ; in males , the attractive traits include achievement , leadership qualities , and job skills ( Regan & Berscheid , 1997 ) . Although humans want mates who are physically attractive , this does not mean that we look for the most attractive person possible . In fact , this observation has led some to propose what is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as their equal in physical attractiveness and social desirability ( Taylor , Fiore , Mendelsohn , & Cheshire , 2011 ) . For example , you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league . So , even if you had proximity to that person , you likely would not ask them out on a date because you believe you likely would be rejected . People weigh a potential partner ’ s attractiveness against the likelihood of success with that person .

4,"Just-World Hypothesis One consequence of westerners ’ tendency to provide dispositional explanations for behavior is victim blame ( Jost & Major , 2001 ) .

In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place , people tend to think that good people experience positive outcomes , and bad people experience negative outcomes ( Jost , Banaji , & Nosek , 2004 ; Jost & Major , 2001 ) .

4,"There are many different theories as to why aggression exists . Some researchers argue that aggression serves an evolutionary function ( Buss , 2004 ) . Men are more likely than women to show aggression ( Wilson & Daly , 1985 ) . From the perspective of evolutionary psychology , human male aggression , like that in nonhuman primates , likely serves to display dominance over other males , both to protect a mate and to perpetuate the male ’ s genes ( Figure 12.25 ) . Sexual jealousy is part of male aggression ; males endeavor to make sure their mates are not copulating with other males , thus ensuring their own paternity of the female ’ s offspring . Although aggression provides an obvious evolutionary advantage for men , women also engage in aggression . Women typically display instrumental forms of aggression , with their aggression serving as a means to an end ( Dodge & Schwartz , 1997 ) . For example , women may express their aggression covertly , for example , by communication that impairs the social standing of another person . Another theory that explains one of the functions of human aggression is frustration aggression theory ( Dollard , Doob , Miller , Mowrer , & Sears , 1939 ) .

4,"Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people , and this behavior is known as discrimination .

As a result of holding negative beliefs ( stereotypes ) and negative attitudes ( prejudice ) about a particular group , people often treat the target of prejudice poorly , such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends . An example of a psychologist experiencing gender discrimination is found in the life and studies of Mary Whiton Calkins . Calkins was given special permission to attend graduate seminars at Harvard ( at that time in the late 1880s , Harvard did not accept women ) and at one point was the sole student of the famous psychologist William James .

4,"Understanding Prejudice and Discrimination As we discussed in the opening story of Trayvon Martin , humans are very diverse and although we share many similarities , we also have many differences . The social groups we belong to help form our identities ( Tajfel , 1974 ) . These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different . Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one ’ s membership in a particular social group ( Allport , 1954 ; Brown , 2010 ) . Prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group . Thus , certain types of education , contact , interactions , and building relationships with members of different cultural groups can reduce the tendency toward prejudice . In fact , simply imagining interacting with members of different cultural groups might affect prejudice . Indeed , when experimental participants were asked to imagine themselves positively interacting with someone from a different group , this led to an increased positive attitude toward the other group and an increase in positive traits associated with the other group . Furthermore , imagined social interaction can reduce anxiety associated with inter-group interactions ( Crisp & Turner , 2009 ) . What are some examples of social groups that you belong to that contribute to your identity ? Social groups can include gender , race , ethnicity , nationality , social class , religion , sexual orientation , profession , and many more . And , as is true for social roles , you can simultaneously be a member of more than one social group . An example of prejudice is having a negative attitude toward people who are not born in the United States . Although people holding this prejudiced attitude do not know all people who were not born in the United States , they dislike them due to their status as foreigners .",0.9932929277420044,0.0,"[2.237949287457842e-148, 1.0, 3.9542589957778856e-55, 4.114413342096763e-49]"
4,"Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect . The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress . Instead , they just watch what is happening . Social psychologists hold that we make these decisions based on the social situation , not our own personality variables . Why do you think the bystanders didn ’ t help Genovese ? What are the benefits to helping her ? What are the risks ? It is very likely you listed more costs than benefits to helping . In this situation , bystanders likely feared for their own lives — if they went to her aid the attacker might harm them . However , how difficult would it have been to make a phone call to the police from the safety of their apartments ? Why do you think no one helped in any way ? Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation . Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( Bandura , 1999 ) . Because there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese , as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building , individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police . The responsibility to call the police was diffused across the number of witnesses to the crime . Have you ever passed an accident on the freeway and assumed that a victim or certainly another motorist has already reported the accident ? In general , the greater the number of bystanders , the less likely any one person will help . 12.7 Prosocial Behavior Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.991252064704895,1.0,"[6.307699670488932e-115, 1.9700563698761825e-55, 1.5375253699078304e-20, 1.0]"

4,"Returning to our earlier example , Greg knew that he lost his job , but an observer would not know . So a naïve observer would tend to attribute Greg ’ s hostile behavior to Greg ’ s disposition rather than to the true , situational cause . Why do you think we underestimate the influence of the situation on the behaviors of others ? One reason is that we often don ’ t have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person ’ s behavior . The only information we might have is what is observable . Due to this lack of information we have a tendency to assume the behavior is due to a dispositional , or internal , factor . When it comes to explaining our own behaviors , however , we have much more information available to us . If you came home from school or work angry and yelled at your dog or a loved one , what would your explanation be ? You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time — a situational explanation . The actor-observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other people ’ s behavior to internal factors ( fundamental attribution error ) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces ( Jones & Nisbett , 1971 ; Nisbett , Caputo , Legant , & Marecek , 1973 ; Choi & Nisbett , 1998 ) .

Altruism is people ’ s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping . In fact , people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping ( Figure 12.27 ) . For example , news accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York reported an employee in the first tower helped his co-workers make it to the exit stairwell . After helping a co-worker to safety he went back in the burning building to help additional co-workers . In this case the costs of helping were great , and the hero lost his life in the destruction ( Stewart , 2002 ) .",0.9773007035255432,1.0,"[6.720386406502201e-122, 2.7840370476563598e-64, 9.313085845246153e-30, 1.0]"

4,"Interestingly , the opposite of social loafing occurs when the task is complex and difficult ( Bond & Titus , 1983 ; Geen , 1989 ) . Remember the previous discussion of choking under pressure ?

In a group setting , such as the student work group , if your individual performance cannot be evaluated , there is less pressure for you to do well , and thus less anxiety or physiological arousal ( Latané , Williams , & Harkens , 1979 ) . This puts you in a relaxed state in which you can perform your best , if you choose ( Zajonc , 1965 ) . If the task is a difficult one , many people feel motivated and believe that their group needs their input to do well on a challenging project ( Jackson & Williams , 1985 ) .

4,"What is Cognitive Dissonance ? Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteem is a powerful motivator of human behavior ( Tavris & Aronson , 2008 ) . In the United States , members of the predominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who are above average on many desirable traits ( Ehrlinger , Gilovich , & Ross , 2005 ) . Often , our behavior , attitudes , and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self-esteem or positive self-image . Psychologist Leon Festinger ( 1957 ) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes , behaviors , or cognitions ( thoughts , beliefs , or opinions ) . Festinger ’ s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self-perceptions , we experience psychological discomfort ( dissonance ) . For example , if you believe smoking is bad for your health but you continue to smoke , you experience conflict between your belief and behavior ( Figure 12.11 ) . Later research documented that only conflicting cognitions that threaten individuals ’ positive self-image cause dissonance ( Greenwald & Ronis , 1978 ) . Additional research found that dissonance is not only psychologically uncomfortable but also can cause physiological arousal ( Croyle & Cooper , 1983 ) and activate regions of the brain important in emotions and cognitive functioning ( van Veen , Krug , Schooler , & Carter , 2009 ) . When we experience cognitive dissonance , we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically , physically , and mentally uncomfortable . We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions , attitudes , and behaviors in line — that is , making them harmonious . This can be done in different ways , such as :",0.9501711130142212,1.0,"[1.4229063696909367e-92, 5.1932256910890445e-19, 1.443426317060247e-33, 1.0]"

Thus , speakers who are credible , or have expertise on the topic , and who are deemed as trustworthy are more persuasive than less credible speakers . Similarly , more attractive speakers are more persuasive than less attractive speakers . The use of famous actors and athletes to advertise products on television and in print relies on this principle .

Messages that are more subtle are more persuasive than direct messages . Arguments that occur first , such as in a debate , are more influential if messages are given back-to-back .

4,"In the United States , the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human behavior . Why do you think this is ? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors , and , therefore , any behavior change must be due to something internal , such as their personality , habits , or temperament . According to some social psychologists , people tend to overemphasize internal factors as explanations — or attributions — for the behavior of other people . They tend to assume that the behavior of another person is a trait of that person , and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior of others . They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables , and thus to the person ’ s state . This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error ( Ross , 1977 ; Riggio & Garcia , 2009 ) . To better understand , imagine this scenario : Greg returns home from work , and upon opening the front door his wife happily greets him and inquires about his day . Instead of greeting his wife , Greg yells at her , “ Leave me alone ! ” Why did Greg yell at his wife ? How would someone committing the fundamental attribution error explain Greg ’ s behavior ? The most common response is that Greg is a mean , angry , or unfriendly person ( his traits ) . This is an internal or dispositional explanation . However , imagine that Greg was just laid off from his job due to company downsizing . Would your explanation for Greg ’ s behavior change ? Your revised explanation might be that Greg was frustrated and disappointed for losing his job ; therefore , he was in a bad mood ( his state ) . This is now an external or situational explanation for Greg ’ s behavior .",0.902200162410736,0.0,"[3.5383569908494688e-93, 3.902812902653516e-46, 3.2960659525020678e-40, 1.0]"

4,"Can you think of a prejudiced attitude you have held toward a group of people ? How did your prejudice develop ? Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype — that is , a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group , regardless of their individual characteristics . Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group . For example , someone holding prejudiced attitudes toward older adults , may believe that older adults are slow and incompetent ( Cuddy , Norton , & Fiske , 2005 ; Nelson , 2004 ) . We cannot possibly know each individual person of advanced age to know that all older adults are slow and incompetent . Therefore , this negative belief is overgeneralized to all members of the group , even though many of the individual group members may in fact be spry and intelligent . Another example of a well-known stereotype involves beliefs about racial differences among athletes . As Hodge , Burden , Robinson , and Bennett ( 2008 ) point out , Black male athletes are often believed to be more athletic , yet less intelligent , than their White male counterparts . These beliefs persist despite a number of high profile examples to the contrary .

The cerebellum , being a large portion of the brain , is considered a separate region . Table 13.1 connects the different stages of development to the adult structures of the CNS .

The lateral sulcus that separates the temporal lobe from the other regions is one such landmark . Superior to the lateral sulcus are the parietal lobe and frontal lobe , which are separated from each other by the central sulcus .

To protect this region from the toxins and pathogens that may be traveling through the blood stream , there is strict control over what can move out of the general systems and into the brain and spinal cord . Because of this privilege , the CNS needs specialized structures for the maintenance of circulation . This begins with a unique arrangement of blood vessels carrying fresh blood into the CNS .

Indeed , the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations , and the term itself is difficult to define . Many scholars adopt the definition developed by German sociologist Max Weber , who said that power is the ability to exercise one ’ s will over others ( Weber 1922 ) . Power affects more than personal relationships ; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups , professional organizations , and governments . Similarly , a government ’ s power is not necessarily limited to control of its own citizens . A dominant nation , for instance , will often use its clout to influence or support other governments or to seize control of other nation states . Efforts by the U .

Endeavors to gain power and influence do not necessarily lead to violence , exploitation , or abuse . Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr . and Mohandas Gandhi , for example , commanded powerful movements that affected positive change without military force .

They would observe , for example , that the United States ’ political system is divided into three distinct branches ( legislative , executive , and judicial ) , and they would explore how public opinion affects political parties , elections , and the political process in general . Sociologists , however , tend to be more interested in the influences of governmental power on society and in how social conflicts arise from the distribution of power . Sociologists also examine how the use of power affects local , state , national , and global agendas , which in turn affect people differently based on status , class , and socioeconomic standing .",0.8919880390167236,0.0,"[1.0, 1.7672588518587178e-32]"

The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface , and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell . The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery , and eventually the host cell bursts , releasing a large number of bacteriophages . Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur , 35 S , to label the protein coat . Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus , 32 P . Because phosphorous is found in DNA , but not protein , the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus .",1.0075615644454956,1.0,"[2.0263473686386704e-83, 1.3883074293069066e-41, 1.0]"
10,"DNA replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes , each of which plays a critical role during the process . One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase , also known as DNA pol , which adds nucleotides one by one to the growing DNA chain that are complementary to the template strand . The addition of nucleotides requires energy ; this energy is obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them , similar to ATP which has three phosphate groups attached . When the bond between the phosphates is broken , the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain . In prokaryotes , three main types of polymerases are known : DNA pol I , DNA pol II , and DNA pol III . It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis ; DNA pol I and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair .",0.9981308579444884,0.0,"[7.042577798825282e-57, 1.0, 3.966106242014146e-52]"

The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode . The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size ; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well ( where the DNA was loaded ) , and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well .

10,"A half century later , British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “ horizontally , ” rather than by descent . In 1928 , he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation , a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell , thereby changing morphology and physiology . He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae , the bacterium that causes pneumonia . Griffith worked with two strains , rough ( R ) and smooth ( S ) . The R strain is non-pathogenic ( does not cause disease ) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule ; as a result , the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope . The S strain is pathogenic ( disease-causing ) and has a capsule outside its cell wall . As a result , it has a smooth appearance under the microscope . Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived . In another experiment , when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain , they also survived . In a third set of experiments , a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice , and — to his surprise — the mice died . Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse , only the S strain of bacteria was recovered . When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice , the mice died . Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic S strain , and he called this the transforming principle ( Figure 14.3 ) . These experiments are now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments .",0.9882583618164062,0.0,"[3.7768706213904045e-90, 4.380375262784882e-90, 1.0]"

10,"How does the replication machinery know where to begin ? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where replication begins . In E . coli , which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome ( as do most prokaryotes ) , it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences . The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site . An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs . ATP hydrolysis is required for this process . As the DNA opens up , Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed . Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi - directionally as replication proceeds . Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix . DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction ( a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction ) . It also requires a free 3 ' - OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3 ' - OH end and the 5 ' phosphate of the next nucleotide . This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3 ' - OH group is not available . Then how does it add the first nucleotide ? The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3 ' - OH end . Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA . Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer . DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer , adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand ( Figure 14.14 ) .",0.9669660925865172,1.0,"[9.785024070937374e-88, 1.0, 2.126687019059579e-54]"
10,"Some errors are not corrected during replication , but are instead corrected after replication is completed ; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair ( Figure 14.18 ) . The enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it ; this is then replaced by the correct base . If this remains uncorrected , it may lead to more permanent damage . How do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one ? In E . coli , after replication , the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group ; the parental DNA strand will have methyl groups , whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them . Thus , DNA polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized , non-methylated strand . In eukaryotes , the mechanism is not very well understood , but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand , as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed .",0.9636751413345336,0.0,"[1.0, 7.313214958387858e-69, 1.6627885157337793e-84]"

10,"The first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was recently published by Richard E . Green et al . in 2010 . 1 Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans . They were known to have lived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago . Green ’ s team studied almost 40,000- year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world . Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination . In their study , the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs . The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that of present-day humans from across the world . After comparing the sequences , the researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in Africa . While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa , the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view . Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences . Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China or France . This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only in Europe and West Asia . Most likely , genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa , before the divergence of Europeans , East Asians , and Papua New Guineans . 1 Richard E .

10,"Watson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix .

The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds ; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds . The two strands are anti-parallel in nature ; that is , the 3 ' end of one strand faces the 5 ' end of the other strand . The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure , whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside . Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm , and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm . Therefore , ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix . The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2 nm , and it is uniform throughout . Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter .

The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge . Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14 N and spun again . During the density gradient centrifugation , the DNA is loaded into a gradient ( typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose ) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm . Under these circumstances , the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient . DNA grown in 15 N will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14 N . Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14 N after they had been shifted from 15 N , the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15 N and 14 N . This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication . The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14 N formed two bands : one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15 N and 14 N , and the other corresponded to the band of 14 N DNA .

12,"Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’ s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ); in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly . The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) . The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind . Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge . To apply the scientific method , a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation , called a hypothesis , to explain the phenomenon . A hypothesis is not just any explanation ; it should fit into the context of a scientific theory . A scientific theory is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time . A theory is the best understanding that we have of that part of the natural world . Armed with the hypothesis , the researcher then makes observations or , better still , carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis . That test and its results are then published so that others can check the results or build on them . It is necessary that any explanation in science be testable , which means that the phenomenon must be perceivable and measurable . For example , that a bird sings because it is happy is not a testable hypothesis , since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird . We must ask a different question , perhaps about the brain state of the bird , since this can be measured . In general , science deals only with matter and energy , that is , those things that can be measured , and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality . This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited , since thoughts , at least as we experience them , are neither matter nor energy . The scientific method is also a form of empiricism . An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities .",1.0119547843933103,1.0,"[1.0, 7.304617925948681e-17]"

12,"Wilhelm Wundt ( 1832 – 1920 ) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist . His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873 . Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience , and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience . Wundt used introspection ( he called it “ internal perception ” ) , a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible , making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed . Wundt ’ s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable ( repeatable ) experience of the mind ( Danziger , 1980 ) . The first stringent requirement was the use of “ trained ” or practiced observers , who could immediately observe and report a reaction . The second requirement was the use of repeatable stimuli that always produced the same experience in the subject and allowed the subject to expect and thus be fully attentive to the inner reaction . These experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate “ interpretation ” in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately , since it cannot be seen by any other person . This attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism . Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 ( Figure 1.3 ) . In this laboratory , Wundt and his students conducted experiments on , for example , reaction times . A subject , sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist , would receive a stimulus such as a light , image , or sound . The subject ’ s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button , and an apparatus would record the time to reaction . Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second ( Nicolas & Ferrand , 1999 ) .",1.0031250715255735,0.0,"[1.2099961049239944e-38, 1.0]"
12,"Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology ’ s history was Sigmund Freud ( Figure 1.5 ) .

Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders , primarily of women with a wide variety of symptoms , including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances , none of which had an apparent physical cause . Freud theorized that many of his patients ’ problems arose from the unconscious mind . In Freud ’ s view , the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness . Gaining access to the unconscious , then , was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient ’ s problems . According to Freud , the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis , by examinations of the first words that came to people ’ s minds , and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue . Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the role of a person ’ s unconscious , as well as early childhood experiences , and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .",1.003060221672058,0.0,"[1.598023633157789e-30, 1.0]"

Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation . In addition , it is used in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy . Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings . Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior . B . F . Skinner ( 1904 – 1990 ) was an American psychologist ( Figure 1.7 ) . Like Watson , Skinner was a behaviorist , and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences . Therefore , Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior . As a part of his research , Skinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through reinforcement and punishment . This device , known as an operant conditioning chamber ( or more familiarly , a Skinner box ) , has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .",1.002256155014038,1.0,"[1.2047242295345296e-11, 0.9999999999879492]"
12,"As mentioned in the previous section , the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior . Thus , cognitive psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions , or thoughts , and their relationship to our experiences and our actions .

12,"An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons . Psychology students hone critical thinking skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method . Critical thinking is the active application of a set of skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information . The evaluation of information — assessing its reliability and usefulness — is an important skill in a world full of competing “ facts , ” many of which are designed to be misleading . For example , critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude of skepticism , recognizing internal biases , making use of logical thinking , asking appropriate questions , and making observations . Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of their undergraduate coursework ( American Psychological Association , 2011 ) . Together , these factors increase students ’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they encounter . In addition to these broad-based skills , psychology students come to understand the complex factors that shape one ’ s behavior . They appreciate the interaction of our biology , our environment , and our experiences in determining who we are and how we will behave . They learn about basic principles that guide how we think and behave , and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across cultural boundaries ( American Psychological Association , 2011 ) .",1.0003879070281982,1.0,"[1.0, 4.2056942538214205e-33]"

Several individuals ( e . g . , Freud and Maslow ) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology , and the American psychologist Gordon Allport , contributed to early theories of personality . These early theorists attempted to explain how an individual ’ s personality develops from his or her given perspective . For example , Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind were carried out over the lifespan . Specifically , Freud theorized that an individual went through various psychosexual stages of development . According to Freud , adult personality would result from the resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous ( or sexual pleasure-producing ) zones from the oral ( mouth ) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals .

While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience , Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed . Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible , Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control . Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior , and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism . A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism . Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could , to some degree , be applied to human behavior . Indeed , Tolman ( 1938 ) stated , “ I believe that everything important in psychology ( except … such matters as involve society and words ) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze . ”",0.9983686208724976,0.0,"[2.3213297712250784e-36, 1.0]"
12,"Abraham Maslow ( 1908 – 1970 ) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior ( Figure 1.8 ) . Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief overview will be provided here . Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met ( e . g . , food , water , shelter ) , higher-level needs ( e . g . , social needs ) would begin to motivate behavior . According to Maslow , the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization , a process by which we achieve our full potential . Obviously , the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic of the humanistic perspective is evident ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) . Humanistic psychologists rejected , on principle , the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and biological sciences , because it missed the “ whole ” human being . Beginning with Maslow and Rogers , there was an insistence on a humanistic research program . This program has been largely qualitative ( not measurement-based ) , but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology , including research on happiness , self-concept , meditation , and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy ( Friedman , 2008 ) .",0.9924599528312684,1.0,"[1.3536604732401156e-29, 1.0]"
12,"William James ( 1842 – 1910 ) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( Figure 1.4 ) . James was introduced to Darwin ’ s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism ’ s characteristics . Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are adapted to their environment , including their behavior . Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual , because it has been naturally selected . As James saw it , psychology ’ s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world , and as such , his perspective was known as functionalism . Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment . Functionalism has a second , more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts , which were the focus of structuralism . Like Wundt , James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental activities , but James also relied on more objective measures , including the use of various recording devices , and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology ( Gordon , 1995 ) .",0.9768747687339784,0.0,"[4.4007853287124384e-27, 1.0]"

These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles . The word Gestalt roughly translates to “ whole ; ” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts , how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception . For example , a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments , but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody , rhythm , and harmony . In many ways , this particular perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt ’ s ideas of structuralism ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .",0.9743118286132812,1.0,"[9.747904998387393e-33, 1.0]"
12,"During the early 20th century , American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis . However , some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so influential to the field . They objected to the pessimism and determinism ( all actions driven by the unconscious ) of Freud . They also disliked the reductionism , or simplifying nature , of behaviorism . Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core , because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment . Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized personal control , intentionality , and a true predisposition for “ good ” as important for our self-concept and our behavior . Thus , humanism emerged . Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans . Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers ( O ’ Hara , n . d . ) .",0.9691064357757568,0.0,"[1.630484066310364e-38, 1.0]"

12,"Carl Rogers ( 1902 – 1987 ) was also an American psychologist who , like Maslow , emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people ( Figure 1.9 ) . Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy . Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind , client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session . Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach : unconditional positive regard , genuineness , and empathy . Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are , no matter what he or she might say .

12,"An article by Naomi Weisstein , first published in 1968 ( Weisstein , 1993 ) , stimulated a feminist revolution in psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science . She also specifically criticized male psychologists for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women . Weisstein used , as examples , statements by prominent psychologists in the 1960s , such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim : “ . . . we must start with the realization that , as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers , they want first and foremost to be womanly companions of men and to be mothers . ” Weisstein ’ s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our knowledge of the psychology of women and , indeed , of both genders . Crawford & Marecek ( 1989 ) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist psychology . These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology , studying psychological gender differences , and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the scientific approach to knowledge .",0.9439212679862976,0.0,"[2.7315307618525957e-27, 1.0]"

This particular perspective has come to be known as the cognitive revolution ( Miller , 2003 ) .

12,"Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology , yet the effects of culture on psychology are under-studied . There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white , American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) . One weakness in the field of cross-cultural psychology is that in looking for differences in psychological attributes across cultures , there remains a need to go beyond simple descriptive statistics ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) . In this sense , it has remained a descriptive science , rather than one seeking to determine cause and effect . For example , a study of characteristics of individuals seeking treatment for a binge eating disorder in Hispanic American , African American , and Caucasian American individuals found significant differences between groups ( Franko et al . , 2012 ) . The study concluded that results from studying any one of the groups could not be extended to the other groups , and yet potential causes of the differences were not measured . This history of multicultural psychology in the United States is a long one . The role of African American psychologists in researching the cultural differences between African American individual and social psychology is but one example . In 1920 , Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United States . Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University , leading to the education of a new generation of African American psychologists ( Black , Spence , and Omari , 2004 ) . Much of the work of early African American psychologists ( and a general focus of much work in first half of the 20th century in psychology in the United States ) was dedicated to testing and intelligence testing in particular ( Black et al . , 2004 ) . That emphasis has continued , particularly because of the importance of testing in determining opportunities for children , but other areas of exploration in African American psychology research include learning style , sense of community and belonging , and spiritualism ( Black et al . , 2004 ) . Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband , Kenneth Clark . They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and internalized racism , research that was instrumental in the Brown v .

These surroundings include the physical environment and , since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction , the social environment . The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin , the co-discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection .

12,"There are many interesting examples of social psychological research , and you will read about many of these in a later chapter of this textbook . Until then , you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted . Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience . After the holocaust , in 1961 , a Nazi war criminal , Adolf Eichmann , who was accused of committing mass atrocities , was put on trial . Many people wondered how German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps , and they were unsatisfied with the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders . At the time , most psychologists agreed that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering , simply because they were obeying orders . Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true ( Figure 1.15 ) . As you will read later in the text , Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person , simply because they were instructed to do so by an authority figure ( in this case , a man dressed in a lab coat ) . This was in spite of the fact that participants received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study . No one was actually hurt or harmed in any way , Milgram ’ s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates , those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have clear , specific directions on how to behave during the research study ( Hock , 2009 ) . Milgram ’ s and others ’ studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research subjects , unless it can be argued not to cause harm and , in general , requiring informed consent of participants .",0.4840176999568939,0.0,"[9.059066220770763e-21, 1.0]"

12,"Evolutionary psychology , and specifically , the evolutionary psychology of humans , has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades . To be subject to evolution by natural selection , a behavior must have a significant genetic cause . In general , we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically , since the genetic differences among human groups are small . The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make observations , or conduct experiments , to determine whether the results match the theory . It is important to recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive , since they lack information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural ( Endler , 1986 ) . Demonstrating that a trait , especially in humans , is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult ; perhaps for this reason , some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants ( Confer et al . , 2010 ) .",0.3642430007457733,0.0,"[1.0, 5.313699957980433e-25]"

12,"Dig Deeper Feminist Psychology The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing , both positive and negative . The dominant influence of Western , white , and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology developed with the biases inherent in those individuals , which often had negative consequences for members of society that were not white or male . Women , members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other countries , and individuals with sexual orientations other than heterosexual had difficulties entering the field of psychology and therefore influencing its development . They also suffered from the attitudes of white , male psychologists , who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they developed and worked . Until the 1960s , the science of psychology was largely a “ womanless ” psychology ( Crawford & Marecek , 1989 ) , meaning that few women were able to practice psychology , so they had little influence on what was studied . In addition , the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men , which resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of sufficient interest to study .",0.3455411493778229,0.0,"[2.6326118296430686e-20, 1.0]"

These may include prison or a rehabilitation center . Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) . A total institution refers to one in which inmates live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place . The third type is utilitarian organizations , which , as the name suggests , are joined because of the need for a specific material reward .

13,"Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864 – 1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) . According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives . The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face-to-face in long-term emotional ways . This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones . The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization . The best example of a primary group is the family . Secondary groups are often larger and impersonal . They may also be task-focused and time-limited . These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal - or task-oriented than emotional . A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group . Neither primary nor secondary groups are bound by strict definitions or set limits . In fact , people can move from one group to another . A graduate seminar , for example , can start as a secondary group focused on the class at hand , but as the students work together throughout their program , they may find common interests and strong ties that transform them into a primary group .",1.018099665641785,1.0,"[1.1401732985972997e-33, 1.0]"

A third perspective is the Symbolic Interaction or Interactionist perspective . This method of analyzing groups takes a micro-level view . Instead of studying the big picture , these researchers look at the day-to-day interactions of groups . Studying these details , the Interactionist looks at issues like leadership style and group dynamics .

13,"One of the ways that groups can be powerful is through inclusion , and its inverse , exclusion . In-groups and out-groups are subcategories of primary and secondary groups that help identify this dynamic . Primary groups consist of both in-groups and out-groups , as do secondary groups . The feeling that one belongs in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way . Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840 – 1910 ) developed the concepts of in-group and out-group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) . In short , an in-group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is . An out-group , conversely , is a group someone doesn ’ t belong to ; often there may be a feeling of disdain or competition in relation to an out-group . Sports teams , unions , and sororities are examples of in-groups and out-groups ; people may belong to , or be an outsider to , any of these . While these affiliations can be neutral or even positive , such as the case of a team sport competition , the concept of in-groups and out-groups can also explain some negative human behavior , such as white supremacist movements like the Ku Klux Klan , or the bullying of gay or lesbian students . By defining others as “ not like us ” and inferior , in-groups can end up practicing ethnocentrism , racism , sexism , ageism , and heterosexism — manners of judging others negatively based on their culture , race , sex , age , or sexuality . Often , in-groups can form within a secondary group . For instance , a workplace can have cliques of people , from senior executives who play golf together , to engineers who write code together , to young singles who socialize after hours . While these in-groups might show favoritism and affinity for other in-group members , the overall organization may be unable or unwilling to acknowledge it . Therefore , it pays to be wary of the politics of in-groups , since members may exclude others as a form of gaining status within the group .",1.0135200023651123,1.0,"[1.9105335540287748e-43, 1.0]"

13,"Bureaucracies are an ideal type of formal organization . Pioneer sociologist Max Weber popularly characterized a bureaucracy as having a hierarchy of authority , a clear division of labor , explicit rules , and impersonality ( 1922 ) . People often complain about bureaucracies – – declaring them slow , rule-bound , difficult to navigate , and unfriendly . Let ’ s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own superiors . For example , as an employee at Walmart , your shift manager assigns you tasks . Your shift manager answers to his store manager , who must answer to her regional manager , and so on in a chain of command , up to the CEO who must answer to the board members , who in turn answer to the stockholders . Everyone in this bureaucracy follows the chain of command .",1.0095820426940918,1.0,"[1.0, 1.5586045266393168e-120]"
13,"Finally , bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality , which takes personal feelings out of professional situations . This characteristic grew , to some extent , out of a desire to protect organizations from nepotism , backroom deals , and other types of favoritism , simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the organization . Impersonality is an attempt by large formal organizations to protect their members . However , the result is often that personal experience is disregarded . For example , you may be late for work because your car broke down , but the manager at Pizza Hut doesn ’ t care about why you are late , only that you are late . Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice . In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript . In order to become a lawyer and represent clients , you must graduate law school and pass the state bar exam . Of course , there are many well-documented examples of success by those who did not proceed through traditional meritocracies . Think about technology companies with founders who dropped out of college , or performers who became famous after a YouTube video went viral . How well do you think established meritocracies identify talent ? Wealthy families hire tutors , interview coaches , test-prep services , and consultants to help their kids get into the best schools . This starts as early as kindergarten in New York City , where competition for the most highly-regarded schools is especially fierce . Are these schools , many of which have copious scholarship funds that are intended to make the school more democratic , really offering all applicants a fair shake ? There are several positive aspects of bureaucracies . They are intended to improve efficiency , ensure equal opportunities , and increase efficiency . And there are times when rigid hierarchies are needed . But remember that many of our bureaucracies grew large at the same time that our school model was developed – – during the Industrial Revolution . Young workers were trained and organizations were built for mass production , assembly line work , and factory jobs . In these scenarios , a clear chain of command was critical . Now , in the information age , this kind of rigid training and adherence to protocol can actually decrease both productivity and efficiency .",1.0070579051971436,1.0,"[1.0, 8.627915271110387e-103]"

In short , the term refers to any collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group . Of course , every time people are gathered it is not necessarily a group . A rally is usually a one-time event , for instance , and belonging to a political party doesn ’ t imply interaction with others . People who exist in the same place at the same time , but who do not interact or share a sense of identity — such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks — are considered an aggregate , or a crowd . Another example of a non-group is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way . These people would be considered a category , and an example would be that all children born from approximately 1980 – 2000 are referred to as “ Millennial . ” Why are Millennials a category and not a group ? Because while some of them may share a sense of identity , they do not , as a whole , interact frequently with each other .",0.9986834526062012,0.0,"[2.803985010253408e-68, 1.0]"
13,"A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction , such as a nuclear family , a dyad , or a triad . Georg Simmel ( 1858 – 1915 ) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad , or two-member group , and a triad , which is a three-member group ( Simmel 1902 ) . In the former , if one person withdraws , the group can no longer exist . One can think of a divorce , which effectively ends the “ group ” of the married couple , or of two best friends never speaking again . In a triad , however , the dynamic is quite different . If one person withdraws , the group lives on . A triad has a different set of relationships . If there are three in the group , two-against-one dynamics can develop and there exists the potential for a majority opinion on any issue . Small groups generally have strong internal cohesiveness and a sense of connection . The challenge , however , is for small groups to achieve large goals . They can struggle to be heard or to be a force for change if they are pushing against larger groups . In short , they are easier to ignore . It is difficult to define exactly when a small group becomes a large group . One step might be when there are too many people to join in a simultaneous discussion . Another might be when a group joins with other groups as part of a movement that unites them . These larger groups may share a geographic space , such as a fraternity or sorority on the same campus , or they might be spread out around the globe . The larger the group , the more attention it can garner , and the more pressure members can put toward whatever goal they wish to achieve . At the same time , the larger the group becomes , the more the risk grows for division and lack of cohesion .",0.994520664215088,1.0,"[3.00646079948689e-38, 1.0]"
13,"The McDonaldization of Society ( Ritzer 1993 ) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business model in common social institutions . This business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , predictability , calculability , and control ( monitoring ) . For example , in your average chain grocery store , people at the register check out customers while stockers keep the shelves full of goods and deli workers slice meats and cheese to order ( efficiency ) . Whenever you enter a store within that grocery chain , you receive the same type of goods , see the same store organization , and find the same brands at the same prices ( predictability ) . You will find that goods are sold by the pound , so that you can weigh your fruit and vegetable purchase rather than simply guessing at the price for that bag of onions , while the employees use a timecard to calculate their hours and receive overtime pay ( calculability ) . Finally , you will notice that all store employees are wearing a uniform ( and usually a name tag ) so that they can be easily identified . There are security cameras to monitor the store , and some parts of the store , such as the stockroom , are generally considered off-limits to customers ( control ) . While McDonaldization has resulted in improved profits and an increased availability of various goods and services to more people worldwide , it has also reduced the variety of goods available in the marketplace while rendering available products uniform , generic , and bland . Think of the difference between a mass-produced shoe and one made by a local cobbler , between a chicken from a family-owned farm versus a corporate grower , or a cup of coffee from the local diner instead of one from Starbucks .",0.9927469491958618,1.0,"[1.0, 7.944353494062688e-109]"

In secondary groups , leadership is usually more overt . There are often clearly outlined roles and responsibilities , with a chain of command to follow . Some secondary groups , like the army , have highly structured and clearly understood chains of command , and many lives depend on those .

13,"In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles . Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making . These leaders work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward . This type of leader is particularly common , for example , in a club where the members vote on which activities or projects to pursue . These leaders can be well liked , but there is often a challenge that the work will proceed slowly since consensus building is time-consuming . A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution . In contrast , a laissez-faire leader ( French for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands-off , allowing group members to self-manage and make their own decisions . An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress . As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks . These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals . Often , entrepreneurs fall into this mold , like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg . Not surprisingly , this type of leader risks alienating the workers . There are times , however , when this style of leadership can be required . In different circumstances , each of these leadership styles can be effective and successful .

A study by the Cyberbullying Research Center found that 20 percent of middle school students admitted to “ seriously thinking about committing suicide ” as a result of online bullying ( Hinduja and Patchin 2010 ) .

15,"Are fewer people today active in politics than in the past ? Political scientist Robert Putnam has argued that civic engagement is declining ; although many Americans may report belonging to groups , these groups are usually large , impersonal ones with thousands of members .

These organizations are different from the types of groups Americans used to belong to , like church groups or bowling leagues . Although people are still interested in volunteering and working for the public good , they are more interested in either working individually or joining large organizations where they have little opportunity to interact with others . Putnam considers a number of explanations for this decline in small group membership , including increased participation by women in the workforce , a decrease in the number of marriages and an increase in divorces , and the effect of technological developments , such as the internet , that separate people by allowing them to feel connected to others without having to spend time in their presence . 19 Putnam argues that a decline in social capital — “ the collective value of all ‘ social networks ’ [ those whom people know ] and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other ” — accompanies this decline in membership in small , interactive groups . 20 Included in social capital are such things as networks of individuals , a sense that one is part of an entity larger than oneself , concern for the collective good and a willingness to help others , and the ability to trust others and to work with them to find solutions to problems .

The right of citizens to participate in government is an important feature of democracy , and over the centuries many have fought to acquire and defend this right . During the American Revolution ( 1775 – 1783 ) , British colonists fought for the right to govern themselves . In the early nineteenth century , agitated citizens called for the removal of property requirements for voting so poor white men could participate in government just as wealthy men could .

The poster shown above ( Figure 1.1 ) , created during World War II , depicts voting as an important part of the fight to keep the United States free . The purpose of voting and other forms of political engagement is to ensure that government serves the people , and not the other way around . But what does government do to serve the people ?

16,"Drinking water is considered voluntary . So how is water intake regulated by the body ? Consider someone who is experiencing dehydration , a net loss of water that results in insufficient water in blood and other tissues . The water that leaves the body , as exhaled air , sweat , or urine , is ultimately extracted from blood plasma . As the blood becomes more concentrated , the thirst response — a sequence of physiological processes — is triggered ( Figure 26.10 ) . Osmoreceptors are sensory receptors in the thirst center in the hypothalamus that monitor the concentration of solutes ( osmolality ) of the blood . If blood osmolality increases above its ideal value , the hypothalamus transmits signals that result in a conscious awareness of thirst . The person should ( and normally does ) respond by drinking water . The hypothalamus of a dehydrated person also releases antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) through the posterior pituitary gland . ADH signals the kidneys to recover water from urine , effectively diluting the blood plasma . To conserve water , the hypothalamus of a dehydrated person also sends signals via the sympathetic nervous system to the salivary glands in the mouth . The signals result in a decrease in watery , serous output ( and an increase in stickier , thicker mucus output ) . These changes in secretions result in a “ dry mouth ” and the sensation of thirst . Decreased blood volume resulting from water loss has two additional effects . First , baroreceptors , blood-pressure receptors in the arch of the aorta and the carotid arteries in the neck , detect a decrease in blood pressure that results from decreased blood volume .

16,"Metabolic and renal compensation for respiratory diseases that can create acidosis revolves around the conservation of bicarbonate ions . In cases of respiratory acidosis , the kidney increases the conservation of bicarbonate and secretion of H + through the exchange mechanism discussed earlier . These processes increase the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood , reestablishing the proper relative concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonic acid . In cases of respiratory alkalosis , the kidneys decrease the production of bicarbonate and reabsorb H + from the tubular fluid .

16,"The respiratory system contributes to the balance of acids and bases in the body by regulating the blood levels of carbonic acid ( Figure 26.16 ) . CO 2 in the blood readily reacts with water to form carbonic acid , and the levels of CO 2 and carbonic acid in the blood are in equilibrium . When the CO 2 level in the blood rises ( as it does when you hold your breath ) , the excess CO 2 reacts with water to form additional carbonic acid , lowering blood pH . Increasing the rate and / or depth of respiration ( which you might feel the “ urge ” to do after holding your breath ) allows you to exhale more CO 2 . The loss of CO 2 from the body reduces blood levels of carbonic acid and thereby adjusts the pH upward , toward normal levels . As you might have surmised , this process also works in the opposite direction . Excessive deep and rapid breathing ( as in hyperventilation ) rids the blood of CO 2 and reduces the level of carbonic acid , making the blood too alkaline . This brief alkalosis can be remedied by rebreathing air that has been exhaled into a paper bag . Rebreathing exhaled air will rapidly bring blood pH down toward normal . The chemical reactions that regulate the levels of CO 2 and carbonic acid occur in the lungs when blood travels through the lung ’ s pulmonary capillaries . Minor adjustments in breathing are usually sufficient to adjust the pH of the blood by changing how much CO 2 is exhaled . In fact , doubling the respiratory rate for less than 1 minute , removing “ extra ” CO 2 , would increase the blood pH by 0.2 . This situation is common if you are exercising strenuously over a period of time . To keep up the necessary energy production , you would produce excess CO 2 ( and lactic acid if exercising beyond your aerobic threshold ) . In order to balance the increased acid production , the respiration rate goes up to remove the CO 2 . This helps to keep you from developing acidosis .",0.98215913772583,0.0,"[2.987147605189673e-52, 1.0, 3.966223899150828e-56]"

As discussed earlier in this chapter , the concentration of carbonic acid in the blood is dependent on the level of CO 2 in the body and the amount of CO 2 gas exhaled through the lungs . Thus , the respiratory contribution to acid-base balance is usually discussed in terms of CO 2 ( rather than of carbonic acid ) . Remember that a molecule of carbonic acid is lost for every molecule of CO 2 exhaled , and a molecule of carbonic acid is formed for every molecule of CO 2 retained .",0.5743491053581238,0.0,"[1.9578014147438638e-73, 1.0, 7.271758267644236e-78]"

Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier — a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain . Astrocytes , in particular , have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity , transmit calcium waves between astrocytes , and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses .

Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system ( CNS ) , made up of a small “ brain ” and two nerve cords , and a peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body . The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized . It contains a brain , ventral nerve cord , and ganglia ( clusters of connected neurons ) .

18,"Long-term depression ( LTD ) is essentially the reverse of LTP : it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection . One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors . In this situation , calcium that enters through NMDA receptors initiates a different signaling cascade , which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane , as illustrated in Figure 35.18 . The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron . While it may seem counterintuitive , LTD may be just as important for learning and memory as LTP .

18,"Long-term potentiation ( LTP ) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection . LTP is based on the Hebbian principle : cells that fire together wire together . There are various mechanisms , none fully understood , behind the synaptic strengthening seen with LTP . One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor , called NMDA ( N-Methyl-D-aspartate ) receptors , shown in Figure 35.18 . These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions ; however , when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession ( either from one neuron or multiple neurons ) , the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell . Next , Ca 2 + ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor , called AMPA ( α-amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid ) receptors , to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane , since activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell . So , the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane , it will have a larger excitatory effect ( EPSP ) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell . The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release . Some drugs of abuse co-opt the LTP pathway , and this synaptic strengthening can lead to addiction .",0.9799362421035768,0.0,"[1.0, 8.825929682397705e-69, 4.9037134550918815e-67]"

This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock , as illustrated in Figure 35.16 . Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa . It is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential .

18,"Action Potential A neuron can receive input from other neurons and , if this input is strong enough , send the signal to downstream neurons . Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter . Transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from dendrite to axon terminal ) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential . When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’ s dendrites , ion channels open . At excitatory synapses , this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane — a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron . A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential ( - 55 mV ) . Na + channels in the axon hillock open , allowing positive ions to enter the cell ( Figure 35.10 and Figure 35.11 ) . Once the sodium channels open , the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about + 40 mV . Action potentials are considered an "" all-or nothing "" event , in that , once the threshold potential is reached , the neuron always completely depolarizes . Once depolarization is complete , the cell must now "" reset "" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential . To accomplish this , the Na + channels close and cannot be opened . This begins the neuron's refractory period , in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open . At the same time , voltage-gated K + channels open , allowing K + to leave the cell . As K + ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative . The diffusion of K + out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential . At this point , the sodium channels will return to their resting state , meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential . Eventually the extra K + ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels , bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state , back to its resting membrane potential .",0.967205047607422,1.0,"[1.0, 1.7997896278277914e-104, 7.63133862681562e-70]"

18,"For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron , it must travel along the axon and reach the axon terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release . The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon ’ s resistance to current leak . Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon ; this increases the speed of action potential conduction . In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis , action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas . The nodes of Ranvier , illustrated in Figure 35.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon . These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na + and K + channels . Flow of ions through these channels , particularly the Na + channels , regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon . This ‘ jumping ’ of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction . If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon , the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na + and K + channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points . Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon .",0.9622862339019777,0.0,"[1.0, 2.0117690399460923e-64, 1.3967872340749725e-44]"

18,"Major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders .

The exact causes of major depression are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental risk factors . Some research supports the “ classic monoamine hypothesis , ” which suggests that depression is caused by a decrease in norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission . One argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some antidepressant medications cause an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning treatment — but clinical results of these medications are not seen until weeks later . This has led to alternative hypotheses : for example , dopamine may also be decreased in depressed patients , or it may actually be an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin that causes the disease , and antidepressants force a feedback loop that decreases this release . Treatments for depression include psychotherapy , electroconvulsive therapy , deep-brain stimulation , and prescription medications . There are several classes of antidepressant medications that work through different mechanisms . For example , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAO inhibitors ) block the enzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters ( including dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine ) , resulting in increased neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron . This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft .

18,"Resting Membrane Potential A neuron at rest is negatively charged : the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside ( − 70 mV , note that this number varies by neuron type and by species ) . This voltage is called the resting membrane potential ; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell . If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions , each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium . Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will , there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell , as shown in Table 35.1 . The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions ( K + ) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential ( Figure 35.10 ) . When the membrane is at rest , K + ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the concentration gradient . The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell ( in the extracellular fluid ) relative to inside the cell ( in the cytoplasm ) . The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement . In neurons , potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell . The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient . However , the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels . Therefore , potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in . Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering , this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell . The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential , once established . Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K + ions into the cell while removing three Na + ions per ATP consumed . As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in , the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid . It should be noted that chloride ions ( Cl – ) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm .",0.9051044583320618,1.0,"[1.0, 3.6202467206383255e-88, 1.3864243226444938e-57]"

18,"The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels , in this case ligand-gated channels , on the postsynaptic membrane to open . Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane , as detailed in Table 35.1 . For example , when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle ( called the neuromuscular junction ) by a presynaptic neuron , it causes postsynaptic Na + channels to open . Na + enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize . This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential . Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane .

Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission .

The bond indenture is a contract that lists the features of the bond , such as the amount of money that will be repaid in the future , called the principal ( also called face value or maturity value ); the maturity date , the day the bond holder will receive the principal amount ; and the stated interest rate , which is the rate of interest the issuer agrees to pay the bondholder throughout the term of the bond .",1.0113335847854614,1.0,"[0.0, 3.290051163068752e-83, 2.690074688439831e-75, 2.408002274016376e-33, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0118389943481904e-136]"

19,"Debt as an option for financing is an important source of funding for businesses . If a company chooses a debt-based option , the business can borrow money on an intermediate ( typically two to four years ) or long-term ( longer than four years ) basis from lenders . In the case of bonds , the funds would be provided by investors . While loans and bonds are similar in that they borrow money on which the borrower will pay interest and eventually repay the lenders , they have some important differences . First , a company can raise funds by borrowing from an individual , bank , or other lender , while a bond is typically sold to numerous investors . When a company chooses a loan , the business signs what is known as a note , and a legal relationship called a note payable is created between the borrower and the lender . The document lists the conditions of the financial arrangement , a fixed predetermined interest rate ( or , if the agreement allows , a variable interest rate ) , the amount borrowed , the borrowing costs to be charged , and the timing of the payments . In some cases , companies will secure an interest-only loan , which means that for the life of the loan the organization pays only the interest expense that has accrued and upon maturity repays the original amount that it borrowed and still owes . For individuals a student loan , car loan , or a mortgage can all be types of notes payable . For Olivia ’ s car purchase in Why It Matters , a document such as a promissory note is typically created , representing a personal loan agreement between a lender and borrower . Figure 13.2 shows a sample promissory note that might be used for a simple , relatively intermediate-term loan .

19,"Municipal bonds , like other bonds , pay periodic interest based on the stated interest rate and the face value at the end of the bond term . However , corporate bonds often pay a higher rate of interest than municipal bonds . Despite the lower interest rate , one benefit of municipal bonds relates to the tax treatment of the periodic interest payments for investors . With corporate bonds , the periodic interest payments are considered taxable income to the investor .

The first principle is there is an inverse relationship between the market rate of interest and the price of the bond . That is , when the market interest rate increases , the price of the bond decreases . This is due to the fact that the stated rate of the bond does not change . 10 As we discussed , when the market interest rate is higher than the stated interest rate of the bond , the bond will sell at a discount to attract investors and to compensate for the interest rate earned between similar bonds . When , on the other hand , the market interest rate is lower than the stated interest rate , the bond will sell at a premium , which also compensates for the interest rate earned between similar bonds . It may be helpful to think of the inverse relationship between the market interest rate and the bond price in terms of analogies such as a teeter-totter in a park or a balance scale , as shown in Figure 13.12 . 10 Another reason for the inverse relationship between the market interest rate and bond prices is due to the time value of money .",0.7508764266967773,0.0,"[0.0, 4.544619858660283e-147, 3.1471252592874106e-110, 1.0, 0.0, 3.623689229187879e-57, 3.130803921870802e-154]"

19,"Bonds issued at a discount are the exact opposite in concept as bonds issued at a premium . If , during the timeframe of establishing the bond stated rate and issuing the bonds , the market rate rises above the stated interest on the bonds , the bonds become less valuable because investors can earn a higher rate of interest on other similar bonds . In other words , the investors will earn a lower rate on these bonds than if the investors purchased similar bonds elsewhere in the market . Naturally , investors would not want to purchase these bonds and earn a lower interest rate than could be earned elsewhere .

Owners may want to use lending , or debt financing , to obtain the money to run operations , but have to turn to investors , or equity financing . Ethical and legal obligations to investors are typically greater than ethical and legal obligations to lenders . This is because a company ’ s owners have an ethical and legal responsibility to take investors ’ interests into account when making business decisions , even if the decision is not in the founding owners ’ best interest .

20,"Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break . Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent , which determines their behavior in biological systems . However , not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds . Weaker bonds can also form between molecules . Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions . Without these two types of bonds , life as we know it would not exist . Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical , life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA , the building block of cells . When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form , the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen ’ s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen . Because the hydrogen is slightly positive , it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges . When this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ + of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ – charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule . This interaction is called a hydrogen bond . This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules . Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken ; however , they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers , creating a major force in combination . Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix . Like hydrogen bonds , van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules . Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities , which are not always symmetrical around an atom .

20,"Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons . The number of protons determines an element ’ s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another .

Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’ s mass number , as illustrated in Figure 2.3 . Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number . This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number .

20,"Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom ’ s electron shell configuration . Within each electron shell are subshells , and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons . While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located , scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path . Subshells are designated by the letter s , p , d , and f . The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital . Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital , which can hold two electrons . Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell , and can hold a total of eight electrons . The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals , as illustrated in Figure 2.8 . Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals , respectively . These are not shown in the illustration .

20,"There are two types of covalent bonds : polar and nonpolar . In a polar covalent bond , shown in Figure 2.12 , the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other . Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( δ + ) or slightly negative ( δ – ) charge develops . This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics . Water is a polar molecule , with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge . This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen ’ s electrons . Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms , giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges , respectively . Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus . Either way , the atom ’ s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other , and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges . ( Hydrogen bonds , which are discussed in detail below , are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules . ) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity , polar bonds are often present in organic molecules .",0.9996368288993835,0.0,"[1.0, 3.5253961369784974e-33, 3.8792034103505504e-30, 1.9988022962727635e-42]"

However , since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells , atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration . When two or more atoms chemically bond with each other , the resultant chemical structure is a molecule .

20,"After approximately 5,730 years , half of the starting concentration of 14 C will have been converted back to 14 N . The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form is called its half-life .

Comparing the ratio of the 14 C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14 C detected in the atmosphere , the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined . On the basis of this amount , the age of the material , such as the pygmy mammoth shown in Figure 2.4 , can be calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years .

20,"So how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances ( a human drinking orange juice , for example ) and survive ? Buffers are the key . Buffers readily absorb excess H + or OH – , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival . Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person ’ s well-being . The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid ( H 2 CO 3 ) , bicarbonate ion ( HCO 3 – ) , and carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) . When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid , hydrogen ions are removed , moderating pH changes . Similarly , as shown in Figure 2.20 , excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs . This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood ’ s pH .

Cleveland was , however , a notable reform president in terms of business regulation and tariffs . When the U . S . Supreme Court ruled in 1886 that individual states could not regulate interstate transportation , Cleveland urged Congress to pass the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 . Among several other powers , this law created the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) to oversee railroad prices and ensure that they remained reasonable to all customers . This was an important shift . In the past , railroads had granted special rebates to big businesses , such as John D . Rockefeller ’ s Standard Oil , while charging small farmers with little economic muscle exorbitant rates . Although the act eventually provided for real regulation of the railroad industry , initial progress was slow due to the lack of enforcement power held by the ICC . Despite its early efforts to regulate railroad rates , the U . S . Supreme Court undermined the commission in Interstate Commerce Commission v . Cincinnati , New Orleans , and Texas Pacific Railway Cos . in 1897 .

Thus , farmers would have immediate cash on hand with which to settle debts and purchase goods , while their crops sat in warehouses and farm prices increased due to this control over supply at the market .

In 1883 , he signed into law the Pendleton Civil Service Act , the first significant piece of antipatronage legislation . This law created the Civil Service Commission , which listed all government patronage jobs and then set aside approximately 10 percent of the list as appointments to be determined through a competitive civil service examination process .

Lower tariffs , on the other hand , would reduce prices and lower the average American ’ s cost of living , and were therefore favored by many working-class families and farmers , to the extent that any of them fully understood such economic forces beyond the prices they paid at stores . Out of growing concern for the latter group , Arthur created the U . S . Tariff Commission in 1882 to investigate the propriety of increasingly high tariffs .

22,"Micro Connections Protein Electrophoresis and the Characterization of Immunoglobulin Structure The advent of electrophoresis ultimately led to researching and understanding the structure of antibodies . When Swedish biochemist Arne Tiselius ( 1902 – 1971 ) published the first protein electrophoresis results in 1937 , 7 he could identify the protein albumin ( the smallest and most abundant serum protein ) by the sharp band it produced in the gel . The other serum proteins could not be resolved in a simple protein electrophoresis , so he named the three broad bands , with many proteins in each band , alpha , beta , and gamma globulins . Two years later , American immunologist Elvin Kabat ( 1914 – 2000 ) traveled to Sweden to work with Tiselius using this new technique and showed that antibodies migrated as gamma globulins . 8 With this new understanding in hand , researchers soon learned that multiple myeloma , because it is a cancer of antibody-secreting cells , could be tentatively diagnosed by the presence of a large M spike in the gamma-globulin region by protein electrophoresis . Prior to this discovery , studies on immunoglobulin structure had been minimal , because of the difficulty of obtaining pure samples to study . Sera from multiple myeloma patients proved to be an excellent source of highly enriched monoclonal immunoglobulin , providing the raw material for studies over the next 20 - plus years that resulted in the elucidation of the structure of immunoglobulin . 7 Tiselius , Arne , “ Electrophoresis of Serum Globulin : Electrophoretic Analysis of Normal and Immune Sera , ” Biochemical Journal 31 , no . 9 ( 1937 ): 1464 . 8 Tiselius , Arne and Elvin A .

22,"In a sandwich ELISA , the goal is to use antibodies to precisely quantify specific antigen present in a solution , such as antigen from a pathogen , a serum protein , or a hormone from the blood or urine to list just a few examples . The first step of a sandwich ELISA is to add the primary antibody to all the wells of a microtiter plate ( Figure 20.24 ) . The antibody sticks to the plastic by hydrophobic interactions . After an appropriate incubation time , any unbound antibody is washed away . Comparable washes are used between each of the subsequent steps to ensure that only specifically bound molecules remain attached to the plate . A blocking protein is then added ( e . g . , albumin or the milk protein casein ) to bind the remaining nonspecific protein-binding sites in the well . Some of the wells will receive known amounts of antigen to allow the construction of a standard curve , and unknown antigen solutions are added to the other wells .

If the patient is indeed infected with hepatitis C virus , the antibodies will bind to the antigens , yielding a positive test result . If the patient is not infected with hepatitic C virus , the antibodies will generally not bind to anything and the test should be negative ; however , a false positive may occur if the patient has been previously infected by any of a variety of pathogens that elicit antibodies that cross-react with the hepatitis C virus antigens . Antibody tests for hepatitis C have high sensitivity ( a low probability of a false negative ) but low specificity ( a high probability of a false positive ) .

The federal government supported the trend with federal sentencing guidelines and additional funds for local law enforcement agencies . This law-and-order movement peaked in the 1990s , when California introduced a “ three strikes ” law that mandated life imprisonment without parole for any third felony conviction — even nonviolent ones .

However , once gastric secretion begins , all three phases can occur simultaneously . The cephalic phase ( reflex phase ) of gastric secretion , which is relatively brief , takes place before food enters the stomach . The smell , taste , sight , or thought of food triggers this phase . For example , when you bring a piece of sushi to your lips , impulses from receptors in your taste buds or the nose are relayed to your brain , which returns signals that increase gastric secretion to prepare your stomach for digestion .

24,"Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements . The presence of food residues in the colon stimulates a slow-moving haustral contraction . This type of movement involves sluggish segmentation , primarily in the transverse and descending colons . When a haustrum is distended with chyme , its muscle contracts , pushing the residue into the next haustrum . These contractions occur about every 30 minutes , and each last about 1 minute . These movements also mix the food residue , which helps the large intestine absorb water . The second type of movement is peristalsis , which , in the large intestine , is slower than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary canal . The third type is a mass movement . These strong waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly force the contents toward the rectum . Mass movements usually occur three or four times per day , either while you eat or immediately afterward .

It is fair to say that long before your sushi exits through the pyloric sphincter , it bears little resemblance to the sushi you ate . The pylorus , which holds around 30 mL ( 1 fluid ounce ) of chyme , acts as a filter , permitting only liquids and small food particles to pass through the mostly , but not fully , closed pyloric sphincter . In a process called gastric emptying , rhythmic mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum . Release of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle it . The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach , where it continues mixing .

Drooling is an extreme instance of the overproduction of saliva . During times of stress , such as before speaking in public , sympathetic stimulation takes over , reducing salivation and producing the symptom of dry mouth often associated with anxiety . When you are dehydrated , salivation is reduced , causing the mouth to feel dry and prompting you to take action to quench your thirst .",0.9963820576667786,0.0,"[1.0, 1.9937396315820072e-56]"

24,"Hepatocytes secrete about one liter of bile each day . A yellow-brown or yellow-green alkaline solution ( pH 7.6 to 8.6 ) , bile is a mixture of water , bile salts , bile pigments , phospholipids ( such as lecithin ) , electrolytes , cholesterol , and triglycerides . The components most critical to emulsification are bile salts and phospholipids , which have a nonpolar ( hydrophobic ) region as well as a polar ( hydrophilic ) region . The hydrophobic region interacts with the large lipid molecules , whereas the hydrophilic region interacts with the watery chyme in the intestine . This results in the large lipid globules being pulled apart into many tiny lipid fragments of about 1 µ m in diameter . This change dramatically increases the surface area available for lipid-digesting enzyme activity . This is the same way dish soap works on fats mixed with water . Bile salts act as emulsifying agents , so they are also important for the absorption of digested lipids . While most constituents of bile are eliminated in feces , bile salts are reclaimed by the enterohepatic circulation . Once bile salts reach the ileum , they are absorbed and returned to the liver in the hepatic portal blood . The hepatocytes then excrete the bile salts into newly formed bile .

24,"When most of the chyme has been absorbed , the small intestinal wall becomes less distended . At this point , the localized segmentation process is replaced by transport movements . The duodenal mucosa secretes the hormone motilin , which initiates peristalsis in the form of a migrating motility complex . These complexes , which begin in the duodenum , force chyme through a short section of the small intestine and then stop . The next contraction begins a little bit farther down than the first , forces chyme a bit farther through the small intestine , then stops . These complexes move slowly down the small intestine , forcing chyme on the way , taking around 90 to 120 minutes to finally reach the end of the ileum . At this point , the process is repeated , starting in the duodenum . The ileocecal valve , a sphincter , is usually in a constricted state , but when motility in the ileum increases , this sphincter relaxes , allowing food residue to enter the first portion of the large intestine , the cecum . Relaxation of the ileocecal sphincter is controlled by both nerves and hormones . First , digestive activity in the stomach provokes the gastroileal reflex , which increases the force of ileal segmentation . Second , the stomach releases the hormone gastrin , which enhances ileal motility , thus relaxing the ileocecal sphincter . After chyme passes through , backward pressure helps close the sphincter , preventing backflow into the ileum . Because of this reflex , your lunch is completely emptied from your stomach and small intestine by the time you eat your dinner .

25,"Smooth muscle fibers are spindle-shaped ( wide in the middle and tapered at both ends , somewhat like a football ) and have a single nucleus ; they range from about 30 to 200 μ m ( thousands of times shorter than skeletal muscle fibers ) , and they produce their own connective tissue , endomysium . Although they do not have striations and sarcomeres , smooth muscle fibers do have actin and myosin contractile proteins , and thick and thin filaments . These thin filaments are anchored by dense bodies . A dense body is analogous to the Z-discs of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers and is fastened to the sarcolemma . Calcium ions are supplied by the SR in the fibers and by sequestration from the extracellular fluid through membrane indentations called calveoli . Because smooth muscle cells do not contain troponin , cross-bridge formation is not regulated by the troponin-tropomyosin complex but instead by the regulatory protein calmodulin . In a smooth muscle fiber , external Ca + + ions passing through opened calcium channels in the sarcolemma , and additional Ca + + released from SR , bind to calmodulin . The Ca + + - calmodulin complex then activates an enzyme called myosin ( light chain ) kinase , which , in turn , activates the myosin heads by phosphorylating them ( converting ATP to ADP and P i , with the P i attaching to the head ) . The heads can then attach to actin-binding sites and pull on the thin filaments . The thin filaments also are anchored to the dense bodies ; the structures invested in the inner membrane of the sarcolemma ( at adherens junctions ) that also have cord-like intermediate filaments attached to them . When the thin filaments slide past the thick filaments , they pull on the dense bodies , structures tethered to the sarcolemma , which then pull on the intermediate filaments networks throughout the sarcoplasm . This arrangement causes the entire muscle fiber to contract in a manner whereby the ends are pulled toward the center , causing the midsection to bulge in a corkscrew motion ( Figure 10.24 ) .",1.0114362239837646,0.0,"[1.0, 1.766989082365832e-21, 4.410659921763428e-78, 1.481116490537256e-68]"

25,"The best-known feature of skeletal muscle is its ability to contract and cause movement . Skeletal muscles act not only to produce movement but also to stop movement , such as resisting gravity to maintain posture . Small , constant adjustments of the skeletal muscles are needed to hold a body upright or balanced in any position . Muscles also prevent excess movement of the bones and joints , maintaining skeletal stability and preventing skeletal structure damage or deformation . Joints can become misaligned or dislocated entirely by pulling on the associated bones ; muscles work to keep joints stable . Skeletal muscles are located throughout the body at the openings of internal tracts to control the movement of various substances . These muscles allow functions , such as swallowing , urination , and defecation , to be under voluntary control .

25,"Smooth muscle is organized in two ways : as single-unit smooth muscle , which is much more common ; and as multiunit smooth muscle . The two types have different locations in the body and have different characteristics . Single-unit muscle has its muscle fibers joined by gap junctions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit . This type of smooth muscle is found in the walls of all visceral organs except the heart ( which has cardiac muscle in its walls ) , and so it is commonly called visceral muscle . Because the muscle fibers are not constrained by the organization and stretchability limits of sarcomeres , visceral smooth muscle has a stress-relaxation response . This means that as the muscle of a hollow organ is stretched when it fills , the mechanical stress of the stretching will trigger contraction , but this is immediately followed by relaxation so that the organ does not empty its contents prematurely . This is important for hollow organs , such as the stomach or urinary bladder , which continuously expand as they fill . The smooth muscle around these organs also can maintain a muscle tone when the organ empties and shrinks , a feature that prevents “ flabbiness ” in the empty organ .

Cardiac muscle fibers also possess many mitochondria and myoglobin , as ATP is produced primarily through aerobic metabolism .

25,"Differences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins — actin and myosin . The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells ( referred to as fibers ) in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle , which creates a pattern , or stripes , called striations . The striations are visible with a light microscope under high magnification ( see Figure 10.2 ) . Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated structures that compose the skeletal muscle . Cardiac muscle fibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as one unit ( called a syncytium ) . Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle , the cytoplasm of a smooth muscle fiber ( which has only a single nucleus ) has a uniform , nonstriated appearance ( resulting in the name smooth muscle ) . However , the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less efficient . Smooth muscle in the walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to push blood through the circulatory system ; and smooth muscle in the skin , visceral organs , and internal passageways is essential for moving all materials through the body . 10.2 Skeletal Muscle Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",1.004297375679016,1.0,"[1.7886970874323476e-61, 1.0, 1.8004360543171875e-70, 3.062727406261801e-76]"
25,"Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical , they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers . Skeletal muscle fibers can be quite large for human cells , with diameters up to 100 μ m and lengths up to 30 cm ( 11.8 in ) in the Sartorius of the upper leg . During early development , embryonic myoblasts , each with its own nucleus , fuse with up to hundreds of other myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers . Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes , permitting the production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle contraction . Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek sarco , which means “ flesh . ” The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called the sarcolemma , the cytoplasm is referred to as sarcoplasm , and the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum , which stores , releases , and retrieves calcium ions ( Ca + + ) is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) ( Figure 10.4 ) .

25,"Aerobic respiration is the breakdown of glucose or other nutrients in the presence of oxygen ( O 2 ) to produce carbon dioxide , water , and ATP . Approximately 95 percent of the ATP required for resting or moderately active muscles is provided by aerobic respiration , which takes place in mitochondria . The inputs for aerobic respiration include glucose circulating in the bloodstream , pyruvic acid , and fatty acids . Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than anaerobic glycolysis , producing approximately 36 ATPs per molecule of glucose versus four from glycolysis . However , aerobic respiration cannot be sustained without a steady supply of O 2 to the skeletal muscle and is much slower ( Figure 10.12 c ) .

25,"Because DMD is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin , it was thought that introducing healthy myoblasts into patients might be an effective treatment . Myoblasts are the embryonic cells responsible for muscle development , and ideally , they would carry healthy genes that could produce the dystrophin needed for normal muscle contraction . This approach has been largely unsuccessful in humans .

The triggers for smooth muscle contraction include hormones , neural stimulation by the ANS , and local factors . In certain locations , such as the walls of visceral organs , stretching the muscle can trigger its contraction ( the stress-relaxation response ) . Axons of neurons in the ANS do not form the highly organized NMJs with smooth muscle , as seen between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers . Instead , there is a series of neurotransmitter-filled bulges called varicosities as an axon courses through smooth muscle , loosely forming motor units ( Figure 10.25 ) .

25,"An isometric contraction occurs as the muscle produces tension without changing the angle of a skeletal joint . Isometric contractions involve sarcomere shortening and increasing muscle tension , but do not move a load , as the force produced cannot overcome the resistance provided by the load . For example , if one attempts to lift a hand weight that is too heavy , there will be sarcomere activation and shortening to a point , and ever-increasing muscle tension , but no change in the angle of the elbow joint . In everyday living , isometric contractions are active in maintaining posture and maintaining bone and joint stability . However , holding your head in an upright position occurs not because the muscles cannot move the head , but because the goal is to remain stationary and not produce movement . Most actions of the body are the result of a combination of isotonic and isometric contractions working together to produce a wide range of outcomes ( Figure 10.13 ) .",0.9987077713012696,0.0,"[1.3803787565608245e-81, 1.0665584378805702e-64, 1.0, 3.6314715299305074e-31]"
25,"All living cells have membrane potentials , or electrical gradients across their membranes . The inside of the membrane is usually around - 60 to - 90 mV , relative to the outside . This is referred to as a cell ’ s membrane potential . Neurons and muscle cells can use their membrane potentials to generate electrical signals . They do this by controlling the movement of charged particles , called ions , across their membranes to create electrical currents . This is achieved by opening and closing specialized proteins in the membrane called ion channels . Although the currents generated by ions moving through these channel proteins are very small , they form the basis of both neural signaling and muscle contraction . Both neurons and skeletal muscle cells are electrically excitable , meaning that they are able to generate action potentials . An action potential is a special type of electrical signal that can travel along a cell membrane as a wave . This allows a signal to be transmitted quickly and faithfully over long distances . Although the term excitation-contraction coupling confuses or scares some students , it comes down to this : for a skeletal muscle fiber to contract , its membrane must first be “ excited ” — in other words , it must be stimulated to fire an action potential . The muscle fiber action potential , which sweeps along the sarcolemma as a wave , is “ coupled ” to the actual contraction through the release of calcium ions ( Ca + + ) from the SR . Once released , the Ca + + interacts with the shielding proteins , forcing them to move aside so that the actin-binding sites are available for attachment by myosin heads . The myosin then pulls the actin filaments toward the center , shortening the muscle fiber . In skeletal muscle , this sequence begins with signals from the somatic motor division of the nervous system . In other words , the “ excitation ” step in skeletal muscles is always triggered by signaling from the nervous system ( Figure 10.6 ) . The motor neurons that tell the skeletal muscle fibers to contract originate in the spinal cord , with a smaller number located in the brainstem for activation of skeletal muscles of the face , head , and neck . These neurons have long processes , called axons , which are specialized to transmit action potentials long distances — in this case , all the way from the spinal cord to the muscle itself ( which may be up to three feet away ) . The axons of multiple neurons bundle together to form nerves , like wires bundled together in a cable . Signaling begins when a neuronal action potential travels along the axon of a motor neuron , and then along the individual branches to terminate at the NMJ . At the NMJ , the axon terminal releases a chemical messenger , or neurotransmitter , called acetylcholine ( ACh ) . The ACh molecules diffuse across a minute space called the synaptic cleft and bind to ACh receptors located within the motor end-plate of the sarcolemma on the other side of the synapse . Once ACh binds , a channel in the ACh receptor opens and positively charged ions can pass through into the muscle fiber , causing it to depolarize , meaning that the membrane potential of the muscle fiber becomes less negative ( closer to zero . ) As the membrane depolarizes , another set of ion channels called voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered to open . Sodium ions enter the muscle fiber , and an action potential rapidly spreads ( or “ fires ” ) along the entire membrane to initiate excitation-contraction coupling . Things happen very quickly in the world of excitable membranes ( just think about how quickly you can snap your fingers as soon as you decide to do it ) . Immediately following depolarization of the membrane , it repolarizes , re-establishing the negative membrane potential . Meanwhile , the ACh in the synaptic cleft is degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) so that the ACh cannot rebind to a receptor and reopen its channel , which would cause unwanted extended muscle excitation and contraction . Propagation of an action potential along the sarcolemma is the excitation portion of excitation-contraction coupling . Recall that this excitation actually triggers the release of calcium ions ( Ca + + ) from its storage in the cell ’ s SR . For the action potential to reach the membrane of the SR , there are periodic invaginations in the sarcolemma , called T-tubules ( “ T ” stands for “ transverse ” ) . You will recall that the diameter of a muscle fiber can be up to 100 μ m , so these T-tubules ensure that the membrane can get close to the SR in the sarcoplasm . The arrangement of a T-tubule with the membranes of SR on either side is called a triad ( Figure 10.7 ) . The triad surrounds the cylindrical structure called a myofibril , which contains actin and myosin . The T-tubules carry the action potential into the interior of the cell , which triggers the opening of calcium channels in the membrane of the adjacent SR , causing Ca + + to diffuse out of the SR and into the sarcoplasm . It is the arrival of Ca + + in the sarcoplasm that initiates contraction of the muscle fiber by its contractile units , or sarcomeres . 10.3 Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9974636435508728,1.0,"[1.6656634165873138e-43, 3.0152313510275373e-07, 0.9999996984768585, 5.7845475030181646e-27]"
25,"The sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber . The sarcomere itself is bundled within the myofibril that runs the entire length of the muscle fiber and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end . As myofibrils contract , the entire muscle cell contracts . Because myofibrils are only approximately 1.2 μ m in diameter , hundreds to thousands ( each with thousands of sarcomeres ) can be found inside one muscle fiber . Each sarcomere is approximately 2 μ m in length with a three-dimensional cylinder-like arrangement and is bordered by structures called Z-discs ( also called Z-lines , because pictures are two-dimensional ) , to which the actin myofilaments are anchored ( Figure 10.5 ) . Because the actin and its troponin-tropomyosin complex ( projecting from the Z-discs toward the center of the sarcomere ) form strands that are thinner than the myosin , it is called the thin filament of the sarcomere .

25,"There is a wide range of motor units within many skeletal muscles , which gives the nervous system a wide range of control over the muscle . The small motor units in the muscle will have smaller , lower-threshold motor neurons that are more excitable , firing first to their skeletal muscle fibers , which also tend to be the smallest . Activation of these smaller motor units , results in a relatively small degree of contractile strength ( tension ) generated in the muscle . As more strength is needed , larger motor units , with bigger , higher-threshold motor neurons are enlisted to activate larger muscle fibers . This increasing activation of motor units produces an increase in muscle contraction known as recruitment . As more motor units are recruited , the muscle contraction grows progressively stronger . In some muscles , the largest motor units may generate a contractile force of 50 times more than the smallest motor units in the muscle . This allows a feather to be picked up using the biceps brachii arm muscle with minimal force , and a heavy weight to be lifted by the same muscle by recruiting the largest motor units .",0.9967466592788696,0.0,"[8.392175936333357e-98, 3.0054568127373823e-60, 1.0, 1.3837285215916191e-50]"

25,"Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body , and the body contains three types of muscle tissue : skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle ( Figure 10.2 ) . All three muscle tissues have some properties in common ; they all exhibit a quality called excitability as their plasma membranes can change their electrical states ( from polarized to depolarized ) and send an electrical wave called an action potential along the entire length of the membrane . While the nervous system can influence the excitability of cardiac and smooth muscle to some degree , skeletal muscle completely depends on signaling from the nervous system to work properly . On the other hand , both cardiac muscle and smooth muscle can respond to other stimuli , such as hormones and local stimuli . The muscles all begin the actual process of contracting ( shortening ) when a protein called actin is pulled by a protein called myosin . This occurs in striated muscle ( skeletal and cardiac ) after specific binding sites on the actin have been exposed in response to the interaction between calcium ions ( Ca + + ) and proteins ( troponin and tropomyosin ) that “ shield ” the actin-binding sites . Ca + + also is required for the contraction of smooth muscle , although its role is different : here Ca + + activates enzymes , which in turn activate myosin heads .

25,"As the ATP produced by creatine phosphate is depleted , muscles turn to glycolysis as an ATP source . Glycolysis is an anaerobic ( non-oxygen-dependent ) process that breaks down glucose ( sugar ) to produce ATP ; however , glycolysis cannot generate ATP as quickly as creatine phosphate . Thus , the switch to glycolysis results in a slower rate of ATP availability to the muscle . The sugar used in glycolysis can be provided by blood glucose or by metabolizing glycogen that is stored in the muscle . The breakdown of one glucose molecule produces two ATP and two molecules of pyruvic acid , which can be used in aerobic respiration or when oxygen levels are low , converted to lactic acid ( Figure 10.12 b ) . If oxygen is available , pyruvic acid is used in aerobic respiration . However , if oxygen is not available , pyruvic acid is converted to lactic acid , which may contribute to muscle fatigue . This conversion allows the recycling of the enzyme NAD + from NADH , which is needed for glycolysis to continue . This occurs during strenuous exercise when high amounts of energy are needed but oxygen cannot be sufficiently delivered to muscle . Glycolysis itself cannot be sustained for very long ( approximately 1 minute of muscle activity ) , but it is useful in facilitating short bursts of high-intensity output . This is because glycolysis does not utilize glucose very efficiently , producing a net gain of two ATPs per molecule of glucose , and the end product of lactic acid , which may contribute to muscle fatigue as it accumulates .",0.9857636094093324,1.0,"[1.6807126209575433e-125, 7.274029461418468e-93, 2.1352339534333788e-66, 1.0]"

25,"View the University of Michigan WebScope to explore the tissue sample in greater detail . Intercalated discs are part of the sarcolemma and contain two structures important in cardiac muscle contraction : gap junctions and desmosomes . A gap junction forms channels between adjacent cardiac muscle fibers that allow the depolarizing current produced by cations to flow from one cardiac muscle cell to the next . This joining is called electric coupling , and in cardiac muscle it allows the quick transmission of action potentials and the coordinated contraction of the entire heart . This network of electrically connected cardiac muscle cells creates a functional unit of contraction called a syncytium . The remainder of the intercalated disc is composed of desmosomes . A desmosome is a cell structure that anchors the ends of cardiac muscle fibers together so the cells do not pull apart during the stress of individual fibers contracting ( Figure 10.22 ) . Contractions of the heart ( heartbeats ) are controlled by specialized cardiac muscle cells called pacemaker cells that directly control heart rate .

Muscle contraction does not occur without sufficient amounts of ATP . The amount of ATP stored in muscle is very low , only sufficient to power a few seconds worth of contractions . As it is broken down , ATP must therefore be regenerated and replaced quickly to allow for sustained contraction . There are three mechanisms by which ATP can be regenerated : creatine phosphate metabolism , anaerobic glycolysis , and fermentation and aerobic respiration . Creatine phosphate is a molecule that can store energy in its phosphate bonds . In a resting muscle , excess ATP transfers its energy to creatine , producing ADP and creatine phosphate . This acts as an energy reserve that can be used to quickly create more ATP . When the muscle starts to contract and needs energy , creatine phosphate transfers its phosphate back to ADP to form ATP and creatine . This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase and occurs very quickly ; thus , creatine phosphate-derived ATP powers the first few seconds of muscle contraction .

Each cycle requires energy , and the action of the myosin heads in the sarcomeres repetitively pulling on the thin filaments also requires energy , which is provided by ATP . Cross-bridge formation occurs when the myosin head attaches to the actin while adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and inorganic phosphate ( P i ) are still bound to myosin ( Figure 10.11 a , b ) . P i is then released , causing myosin to form a stronger attachment to the actin , after which the myosin head moves toward the M-line , pulling the actin along with it . As actin is pulled , the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M-line . This movement is called the power stroke , as movement of the thin filament occurs at this step ( Figure 10.11 c ) .

25,"Although atrophy due to disuse can often be reversed with exercise , muscle atrophy with age , referred to as sarcopenia , is irreversible . This is a primary reason why even highly trained athletes succumb to declining performance with age . This decline is noticeable in athletes whose sports require strength and powerful movements , such as sprinting , whereas the effects of age are less noticeable in endurance athletes such as marathon runners or long-distance cyclists . As muscles age , muscle fibers die , and they are replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue ( Figure 10.20 ) . Because those tissues cannot contract and generate force as muscle can , muscles lose the ability to produce powerful contractions . The decline in muscle mass causes a loss of strength , including the strength required for posture and mobility . This may be caused by a reduction in FG fibers that hydrolyze ATP quickly to produce short , powerful contractions . Muscles in older people sometimes possess greater numbers of SO fibers , which are responsible for longer contractions and do not produce powerful movements .

In fact , without information from the innate immune system , the adaptive response could not be mobilized . There are two types of adaptive responses : the cell-mediated immune response , which is carried out by T cells , and the humoral immune response , which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies . Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen .

Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies . Binding of complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence , with each successive protein being activated by cleavage and / or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein ( s ) .

27,"When stimulated by the T H 2 pathway , naïve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells . A plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies ; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens . Similar to T cells , naïve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors ( BCRs ) , which are membrane-bound forms of Ig ( immunoglobulin , or an antibody ) . The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages . Each chain has a constant and a variable region ; the latter is involved in antigen binding . Two other membrane proteins , Ig alpha and Ig beta , are involved in signaling . The receptors of any particular B cell , as shown in Figure 42.13 are all the same , but the hundreds of millions of different B cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types of molecular structures to which they can bind . In this state , B cells function as APCs . They bind and engulf foreign antigens via their BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to T H 2 cells . When a T H 2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen , it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly , which makes thousands of identical ( clonal ) copies of it , and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs . The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection .

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) , illustrated in Figure 42.15 , is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body . This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment . The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types . Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue . M cells function in the transport described , and are located in the Peyer ’ s patch , a lymphoid nodule . APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells , with B cells and macrophages having minor roles . Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites , such as the tonsils , adenoids , appendix , or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine .

T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes . T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow . NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells . MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells , thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated .

The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and / or trafficking to the cell surface .

This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface , which NK cells detect as “ unhealthy ” or “ abnormal ” while searching for cellular MHC I molecules .

For instance , a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor ’ s blood serum .

27,"An infection may be intracellular or extracellular , depending on the pathogen . All viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells ( intracellularly ) , whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly , depending on the species . The innate immune system must respond accordingly : by identifying the extracellular pathogen and / or by identifying host cells that have already been infected . When a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) on the pathogen ’ s surface . PAMPs are carbohydrate , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ signatures ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells . The immune system has specific cells , described in Figure 42.2 and shown in Figure 42.3 , with receptors that recognize these PAMPs . A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens . Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) . PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment . A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue . Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction . Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules ) . TLRs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates , and appear to be one of the most ancient components of the immune system . TLRs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system . Cytokine Release Effect The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines , which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells . A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation ( form and function ) , proliferation ( production ) , and gene expression to affect immune responses . At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them , the cell type that responds to them , and the changes they produce . One type cytokine , interferon , is illustrated in Figure 42.4 . One subclass of cytokines is the interleukin ( IL ) , so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes ( white blood cells ) . Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses . In addition to being released from cells after PAMP recognition , cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines , which results in a cytokine burst .",1.0028077363967896,1.0,"[1.6203212586299711e-34, 3.7641378126049525e-19, 1.0]"

27,"Chapter Outline 42.1 Innate Immune Response 42.2 Adaptive Immune Response 42.3 Antibodies 42.4 Disruptions in the Immune System Introduction The environment consists of numerous pathogens , which are agents , usually microorganisms , that cause diseases in their hosts . A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen . Pathogens include bacteria , protists , fungi and other infectious organisms . We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water , on surfaces , and in the air . Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens ; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents . Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens . When pathogens are found , immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection . The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen , strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently , and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage . The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure . This memory can last several decades . Features of the immune system , such as pathogen identification , specific response , amplification , retreat , and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens . The immune response can be classified as either innate or active . The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones . Conversely , the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses .",0.9952394962310792,0.0,"[7.711168200628089e-69, 3.9546212336642277e-26, 1.0]"
27,"Naïve T cells can express one of two different molecules , CD4 or CD8 , on their surface , as shown in Figure 42.11 , and are accordingly classified as CD4 + or CD8 + cells . These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC . Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( T H ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat . In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen-embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response . The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune protection , but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors ( TCRs ) . The CD4 or CD8 surface molecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I molecule .

27,"The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy . In the United States , 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma , whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens . Upon initial exposure to a potential allergen , an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to T H cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE . This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms . The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues . This process primes , or sensitizes , the tissue . Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen , IgE molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin ; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses . Figure 42.26 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen . The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy , watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives , airway contraction with severe respiratory distress , and plummeting blood pressure .

27,"The T H lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system . These cells are important for extracellular infections , such as those caused by certain bacteria , helminths , and protozoa . T H lymphocytes recognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs . There are two major populations of T H cells : T H 1 and T H 2 . T H 1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells . T H 1 cells activate the action of cyotoxic T cells , as well as macrophages . T H 2 cells stimulate naïve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion . Whether a T H 1 or a T H 2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system , which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen . The T H 1 - mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation . Recall the frontline defenses of macrophages involved in the innate immune response . Some intracellular bacteria , such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , have evolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed . These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy and digest the pathogen . When M . tuberculosis infection occurs , macrophages can stimulate naïve T cells to become T H 1 cells . These stimulated T cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive capabilities and allow it to destroy the colonizing M . tuberculosis .

Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen .

27,"Consider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime . The mammalian adaptive immune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen . Mammals have an enormous diversity of T cell populations , resulting from the diversity of TCRs . Each TCR consists of two polypeptide chains that span the T cell membrane , as illustrated in Figure 42.12 ; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge . Each polypeptide chain is comprised of a constant domain and a variable domain : a domain , in this sense , is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or structural . The intracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling . A single T cell will express thousands of identical copies of one specific TCR variant on its cell surface . The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it synthesizes millions of different T cell populations , each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain . This TCR diversity is achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of T cells .

27,"A functioning immune system is essential for survival , but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses of the mammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step .

Staphylococcus aureus ( bacterium that can cause skin infections , abscesses , and meningitis ) synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium . Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system . HIV infects T H cells via their CD4 surface molecules , gradually depleting the number of T H cells in the body ; this inhibits the adaptive immune system ’ s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors .

29,"This flexibility about speaking in the Senate gave rise to a unique tactic , the filibuster . The word “ filibuster ” comes from the Dutch word vrijbuiter , which means pirate . And the name is appropriate , since a senator who launches a filibuster virtually hijacks the floor of the chamber by speaking for long periods of time , thus preventing the Senate from closing debate and acting on a bill . The tactic was perfected in the 1850s as Congress wrestled with the complicated issue of slavery . After the Civil War , the use of the filibuster became even more common . Eventually , in 1917 , the Senate passed Rule 22 , which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate . To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two-thirds majority . This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’ s record twenty-four-hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty-five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .

This cause of urethritis will be discussed in Bacterial Infections of the Reproductive System . The term nongonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) refers to inflammation of the urethra that is unrelated to N . gonorrhoeae . In women , NGU is often asymptomatic . In men , NGU is typically a mild disease , but can lead to purulent discharge and dysuria . Because the symptoms are often mild or nonexistent , most infected individuals do not know that they are infected , yet they are carriers of the disease . Asymptomatic patients also have no reason to seek treatment , and although not common , untreated NGU can spread to the reproductive organs , causing pelvic inflammatory disease and salpingitis in women and epididymitis and prostatitis in men .

Because both systems are open to the external environment , they are prone to infections . Some infections are introduced from outside , whereas others result from imbalances in the microbiota of the urogenital tract . Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) are one the most common bacterial infections worldwide , affecting over 100 million people each year . During 2007 in the United States , doctor office visits for UTIs exceeded 10 million , and an additional 2 – 3 million emergency department visits were attributed to UTIs . Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) also primarily affect the urogenital system and are an important cause of patient morbidity . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates that there are approximately 20 million new cases of reportable STIs annually in the United States , half of which occur in people aged 15 – 24 years old . When STIs spread to the reproductive organs , they can be associated with severe morbidity and loss of fertility . Because males and females have different urogenital anatomy , urogenital infections may affect males and females differently .

It has been found that fathers are firmer in their expectations for gender conformity than are mothers , and their expectations are stronger for sons than they are for daughters ( Kimmel 2000 ) . This is true in many types of activities , including preference of toys , play styles , discipline , chores , and personal achievements . As a result , boys tend to be particularly attuned to their father ’ s disapproval when engaging in an activity that might be considered feminine , like dancing or singing ( Coltraine and Adams 2008 ) .

It was not until the 1950s that American and British psychologists and other professionals working with intersex and transsexual patients formally began distinguishing between sex and gender . Since then , psychological and physiological professionals have increasingly used the term gender ( Moi 2005 ) . By the end of the 21st century , expanding the proper usage of the term gender to everyday language became more challenging — particularly where legal language is concerned . In an effort to clarify usage of the terms sex and gender , U . S .

That is to say , gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine is to male ” ( J . E . B . v . Alabama , 144 S . Ct . 1436 [ 1994 ] ) .

32,"Roosevelt entered the 1936 presidential election on a wave of popularity , and he beat Republican opponent Alf Landon by a nearly unanimous Electoral College vote of 523 to 8 . Believing it to be his moment of strongest public support , Roosevelt chose to exact a measure of revenge against the U . S . Supreme Court for challenging his programs and to pressure them against challenging his more recent Second New Deal provisions . To this end , Roosevelt created the informally named “ Supreme Court Packing Plan ” and tried to pack the court in his favor by expanding the number of justices and adding new ones who supported his views . His plan was to add one justice for every current justice over the age of seventy who refused to step down . This would have allowed him to add six more justices , expanding the bench from nine to fifteen . Opposition was quick and thorough from both the Supreme Court and Congress , as well as from his own party . The subsequent retirement of Justice Van Devanter from the court , as well as the sudden death of Senator Joe T . Robinson , who championed Roosevelt ’ s plan before the Senate , all but signaled Roosevelt ’ s defeat . However , although he never received the support to make these changes , Roosevelt appeared to succeed in politically intimidating the current justices into supporting his newer programs , and they upheld both the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act .

Under the new system , there would be a seven-member board of governors to oversee regional banks .

32,"Unlike Hoover , who professed an ideology of “ American individualism , ” an adherence that rendered him largely incapable of widespread action , Roosevelt remained pragmatic and open-minded to possible solutions . To assist in formulating a variety of relief and recovery programs , Roosevelt turned to a group of men who had previously orchestrated his election campaign and victory . Collectively known as the “ Brains Trust ” ( a phrase coined by a New York Times reporter to describe the multiple “ brains ” on Roosevelt ’ s advisory team ) , the group most notably included Rexford Tugwell , Raymond Moley , and Adolph Berle . Moley , credited with bringing the group into existence , was a government professor who advocated for a new national tax policy to help the nation recover from its economic woes . Tugwell , who eventually focused his energy on the country ’ s agricultural problems , saw an increased role for the federal government in setting wages and prices across the economy . Berle was a mediating influence , who often advised against a centrally controlled economy , but did see the role that the federal government could play in mediating the stark cycles of prosperity and depression that , if left unchecked , could result in the very situation in which the country presently found itself . Together , these men , along with others , advised Roosevelt through the earliest days of the New Deal and helped to craft significant legislative programs for congressional review and approval .",0.9782392978668212,0.0,"[1.0, 3.217281139372874e-35]"

What later became known as the “ First New Deal ” ushered in a wave of legislative activity seldom before seen in the history of the country . By the close of 1933 , in an effort to stem the crisis , Congress had passed over fifteen significant pieces of legislation — many of the circulated bills allegedly still wet with ink from the printing presses as members voted upon them .

Facing such criticism early in his administration , Roosevelt undertook some efforts to ensure a measure of equality in hiring practices for the relief agencies , and opportunities began to present themselves by 1935 . The WPA eventually employed 350,000 African Americans annually , accounting for nearly 15 percent of its workforce . By the close of the CCC in 1938 , this program had employed over 300,000 African Americans , increasing the Black percentage of its workforce from 3 percent at the outset to nearly 11 percent at its close .

In all , over five thousand banks had been shuttered . Within forty-eight hours of his inauguration , Roosevelt proclaimed an official bank holiday and called Congress into a special session to address the crisis . The resulting Emergency Banking Act of 1933 was signed into law on March 9 , 1933 , a scant eight hours after Congress first saw it . The law officially took the country off the gold standard , a restrictive practice that , although conservative and traditionally viewed as safe , severely limited the circulation of paper money . Those who held gold were told to sell it to the U . S . Treasury for a discounted rate of a little over twenty dollars per ounce . Furthermore , dollar bills were no longer redeemable in gold . The law also gave the comptroller of currency the power to reorganize all national banks faced with insolvency , a level of federal oversight seldom seen prior to the Great Depression .

32,"Roosevelt was not as successful in addressing the nation ’ s growing deficit . When he entered the presidency in 1933 , Roosevelt did so with traditionally held fiscal beliefs , including the importance of a balanced budget in order to maintain public confidence in federal government operations . However , the severe economic conditions of the depression quickly convinced the president of the importance of government spending to create jobs and relief for the American people . As he commented to a crowd in Pittsburgh in 1936 , “ To balance our budget in 1933 or 1934 or 1935 would have been a crime against the American people . To do so . . . we should have had to set our face against human suffering with callous indifference . When Americans suffered , we refused to pass by on the other side . Humanity came first . ” However , after his successful re-election , Roosevelt anticipated that the economy would recover enough by late 1936 that he could curtail spending by 1937 . This reduction in spending , he hoped , would curb the deficit . As the early months of 1937 unfolded , Roosevelt ’ s hopes seemed supported by the most recent economic snapshot of the country . Production , wages , and profits had all returned to pre - 1929 levels , while unemployment was at its lowest rate in the decade , down from 25 percent to 14 percent . But no sooner did Roosevelt cut spending when a recession hit . Two million Americans were newly out of work as unemployment quickly rose by 5 percent and industrial production declined by a third . Breadlines began to build again , while banks prepared to close . Historians continue to debate the causes of this recession within a depression . Some believe the fear of increased taxes forced factory owners to curtail planned expansion ; others blame the Federal Reserve for tightening the nation ’ s money supply . Roosevelt , however , blamed the downturn on his decision to significantly curtail federal government spending in job relief programs such as the WPA . Several of his closest advisors , including Harry Hopkins , Henry Wallace , and others , urged him to adopt the new economic theory espoused by British economic John Maynard Keynes , who argued that deficit spending was necessary in advanced capitalist economies in order to maintain employment and stimulate consumer spending . Convinced of the necessity of such an approach , Roosevelt asked Congress in the spring of 1938 for additional emergency relief spending . Congress immediately authorized $ 33 billion for PWA and WPA work projects . Although World War II would provide the final impetus for lasting economic recovery , Roosevelt ’ s willingness to adapt in 1938 avoided another disaster .",0.9097325205802916,0.0,"[1.0, 1.0101183035381063e-51]"

More importantly , the NIRA suspended antitrust laws and allowed businesses and industries to work together in order to establish codes of fair competition , including issues of price setting and minimum wages .

In fact , it was not a master plan at all , but rather a series of , at times , disjointed efforts made from different assumptions . But after taking office and analyzing the crisis , Roosevelt and his advisors did feel that they had a larger sense of what had caused the Great Depression and thus attempted a variety of solutions to fix it . They believed that it was caused by abuses on the part of a small group of bankers and businessmen , aided by Republican policies that built wealth for a few at the expense of many . The answer , they felt , was to root out these abuses through banking reform , as well as adjust production and consumption of both farm and industrial goods . This adjustment would come about by increasing the purchasing power of everyday people , as well as through regulatory policies like the NRA and AAA . While it may seem counterintuitive to raise crop prices and set prices on industrial goods , Roosevelt ’ s advisors sought to halt the deflationary spiral and economic uncertainty that had prevented businesses from committing to investments and consumers from parting with their money . 26.3 The Second New Deal Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you should be able to :",0.8932675719261169,0.0,"[1.0, 2.9062441084071616e-47]"

The WPA became the first specific New Deal agency to openly hire women — specifically widows , single women , and the wives of disabled husbands . While they did not take part in construction projects , these women did undertake sewing projects to provide blankets and clothing to hospitals and relief agencies .

The Permian period also saw a second major divergence of diapsid reptiles into archosaurs ( predecessors of crocodilians and dinosaurs ) and lepidosaurs ( predecessors of snakes and lizards ) . These groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period , when the archosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during the Permian-Triassic extinction . About 250 million years ago , archosaurs radiated into the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs . Although they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs , the pterosaurs were distinct from true dinosaurs ( Figure 29.23 ) .

33,"Dinosaurs ( including birds ) are further subdivided into two groups , the Saurischia ( “ lizard like ” ) and the Ornithischia ( “ bird like ” ) .

Rather , Saurischia diverged into two groups : One included the long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs , such as Apatosaurus . The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds . This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( Figure 29.33 ) . Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs , because it is an intermediate fossil , meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds . Some scientists propose classifying it as a bird , but others prefer to classify it as a dinosaur . The fossilized skeleton of Archaeopteryx looks like that of a dinosaur , and it had teeth whereas birds do not , but it also had feathers modified for flight , a trait associated only with birds among modern animals . Fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist , but the feathers do not have the characteristics of flight feathers . It is still unclear exactly how flight evolved in birds . Two main theories exist , the arboreal ( “ tree ” ) hypothesis and the terrestrial ( “ land ” ) hypothesis . The arboreal hypothesis posits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from branch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight . In contrast to this , the terrestrial hypothesis holds that running was the stimulus for flight , as wings could be used to improve running and then became used for flapping flight . Like the question of how flight evolved , the question of how endothermy evolved in birds still is unanswered . Feathers provide insulation , but this is only beneficial if body heat is being produced internally . Similarly , internal heat production is only viable if insulation is present to retain that heat .

33,"Australopithecus ( “ southern ape ” ) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago . This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus , genus Homo , evolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about 2 million years ago ( after likely passing through some transitional states ) . Australopithecus had a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern humans . For example , sexual dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans . Males were up to 50 percent larger than females , a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans . In contrast , modern human males are approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females . The brain size of Australopithecus relative to its body mass was also smaller than modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes . A key feature that Australopithecus had in common with modern humans was bipedalism , although it is likely that Australopithecus also spent time in trees . Hominin footprints , similar to those of modern humans , were found in Laetoli , Tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago . They showed that hominins at the time of Australopithecus were walking upright . There were a number of Australopithecus species , which are often referred to as australopiths . Australopithecus anamensis lived about 4.2 million years ago . More is known about another early species , Australopithecus afarensis , which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago .

Chewing also requires the ability to chew and breathe at the same time , which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate .

33,"There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens .

Then , modern humans replaced H . erectus species that had migrated into Asia and Europe in the first wave . This evolutionary timeline is supported by molecular evidence . One approach to studying the origins of modern humans is to examine mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) from populations around the world . Because a fetus develops from an egg containing its mother ’ s mitochondria ( which have their own , non-nuclear DNA ) , mtDNA is passed entirely through the maternal line . Mutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence .

34,"As cities grew and sprawled outward , a major challenge was efficient travel within the city — from home to factories or shops , and then back again . Most transportation infrastructure was used to connect cities to each other , typically by rail or canal . Prior to the 1880s , two of the most common forms of transportation within cities were the omnibus and the horse car . An omnibus was a large , horse-drawn carriage . A horse car was similar to an omnibus , but it was placed on iron or steel tracks to provide a smoother ride . While these horse-driven vehicles worked adequately in smaller , less-congested cities , they were not equipped to handle the larger crowds that developed at the close of the century . The horses had to stop and rest , and horse manure became an ongoing problem . In 1887 , Frank Sprague invented the electric trolley , which worked along the same concept as the horse car , with a large wagon on tracks , but was powered by electricity rather than horses . The electric trolley could run throughout the day and night , like the factories and the workers who fueled them . But it also modernized less important industrial centers , such as the southern city of Richmond , Virginia . As early as 1873 , San Francisco engineers adopted pulley technology from the mining industry to introduce cable cars and turn the city ’ s steep hills into elegant middle-class communities . However , as crowds continued to grow in the largest cities , such as Chicago and New York , trolleys were unable to move efficiently through the crowds of pedestrians ( Figure 19.4 ) . To avoid this challenge , city planners elevated the trolley lines above the streets , creating elevated trains , or L-trains , as early as 1868 in New York City , and quickly spreading to Boston in 1887 and Chicago in 1892 . Finally , as skyscrapers began to dominate the air , transportation evolved one step further to move underground as subways .

From wide-open green spaces to brightly painted white buildings , connected with modern transportation services and appropriate sanitation , the “ White City ” set the stage for American urban city planning for the next generation , beginning in 1901 with the modernization of Washington , DC . This model encouraged city planners to consider three principal tenets : First , create larger park areas inside cities ; second , build wider boulevards to decrease traffic congestion and allow for lines of trees and other greenery between lanes ; and third , add more suburbs in order to mitigate congested living in the city itself ( Figure 19.15 ) .

The aldermen knew that , rather than work through the long bureaucratic process associated with city hall , they could work within the “ machine ” of local politics to find a speedy , mutually beneficial solution . In machine politics , favors were exchanged for votes , votes were given in exchange for fast solutions , and the price of the solutions included a kickback to the boss . In the short term , everyone got what they needed , but the process was neither transparent nor democratic , and it was an inefficient way of conducting the city ’ s business .",0.9928277730941772,1.0,"[2.62757876504547e-31, 1.0]"
34,"Another common form of popular entertainment was vaudeville — large stage variety shows that included everything from singing , dancing , and comedy acts to live animals and magic . The vaudeville circuit gave rise to several prominent performers , including magician Harry Houdini , who began his career in these variety shows before his fame propelled him to solo acts . In addition to live theater shows , it was primarily working-class citizens who enjoyed the advent of the nickelodeon , a forerunner to the movie theater . The first nickelodeon opened in Pittsburgh in 1905 , where nearly one hundred visitors packed into a storefront theater to see a traditional vaudeville show interspersed with one-minute film clips . Several theaters initially used the films as “ chasers ” to indicate the end of the show to the live audience so they would clear the auditorium . However , a vaudeville performers ’ strike generated even greater interest in the films , eventually resulting in the rise of modern movie theaters by 1910 .",0.9911333322525024,0.0,"[3.2420336073114266e-71, 1.0]"
34,"The last limitation that large cities had to overcome was the ever-increasing need for space . Eastern cities , unlike their midwestern counterparts , could not continue to grow outward , as the land surrounding them was already settled . Geographic limitations such as rivers or the coast also hampered sprawl . And in all cities , citizens needed to be close enough to urban centers to conveniently access work , shops , and other core institutions of urban life . The increasing cost of real estate made upward growth attractive , and so did the prestige that towering buildings carried for the businesses that occupied them . Workers completed the first skyscraper in Chicago , the ten-story Home Insurance Building , in 1885 ( Figure 19.5 ) . Although engineers had the capability to go higher , thanks to new steel construction techniques , they required another vital invention in order to make taller buildings viable : the elevator . In 1889 , the Otis Elevator Company , led by inventor Elisha Otis , installed the first electric elevator . This began the skyscraper craze , allowing developers in eastern cities to build and market prestigious real estate in the hearts of crowded eastern metropoles . Defining American Jacob Riis and the Window into “ How the Other Half Lives ” Jacob Riis was a Danish immigrant who moved to New York in the late nineteenth century and , after experiencing poverty and joblessness first-hand , ultimately built a career as a police reporter . In the course of his work , he spent much of his time in the slums and tenements of New York ’ s working poor . Appalled by what he found there , Riis began documenting these scenes of squalor and sharing them through lectures and ultimately through the publication of his book , How the Other Half Lives , in 1890 ( Figure 19.6 ) .",0.9885680675506592,0.0,"[1.0029986721510617e-30, 1.0]"

The report put it simply : These newer immigrants looked and acted differently . They had darker skin tone , spoke languages with which most Americans were unfamiliar , and practiced unfamiliar religions , specifically Judaism and Catholicism . Even the foods they sought out at butchers and grocery stores set immigrants apart . Because of these easily identifiable differences , new immigrants became easy targets for hatred and discrimination .

34,"In the 1888 novel Looking Backward , 2000-1887 , Edward Bellamy portrays a utopian America in the year 2000 , with the country living in peace and harmony after abandoning the capitalist model and moving to a socialist state . In the book , Bellamy predicts the future advent of credit cards , cable entertainment , and “ super-store ” cooperatives that resemble a modern day Wal-Mart . Looking Backward proved to be a popular bestseller ( third only to Uncle Tom ’ s Cabin and Ben Hur among late nineteenth-century publications ) and appealed to those who felt the industrial age of big business was sending the country in the wrong direction . Eugene Debs , who led the national Pullman Railroad Strike in 1894 , later commented on how Bellamy ’ s work influenced him to adopt socialism as the answer to the exploitative industrial capitalist model . In addition , Bellamy ’ s work spurred the publication of no fewer than thirty-six additional books or articles by other writers , either supporting Bellamy ’ s outlook or directly criticizing it . In 1897 , Bellamy felt compelled to publish a sequel , entitled Equality , in which he further explained ideas he had previously introduced concerning educational reform and women ’ s equality , as well as a world of vegetarians who speak a universal language . Another author whose work illustrated the criticisms of the day was nonfiction writer Henry George , an economist best known for his 1879 work Progress and Poverty , which criticized the inequality found in an industrial economy . He suggested that , while people should own that which they create , all land and natural resources should belong to all equally , and should be taxed through a “ single land tax ” in order to disincentivize private land ownership .

Baseball games provided an inexpensive form of entertainment , where for less than a dollar , a person could enjoy a double-header , two hot dogs , and a beer .

Living conditions for most working-class urban dwellers were atrocious . They lived in crowded tenement houses and cramped apartments with terrible ventilation and substandard plumbing and sanitation . As a result , disease ran rampant , with typhoid and cholera common . Memphis , Tennessee , experienced waves of cholera ( 1873 ) followed by yellow fever ( 1878 and 1879 ) that resulted in the loss of over ten thousand lives . By the late 1880s , New York City , Baltimore , Chicago , and New Orleans had all introduced sewage pumping systems to provide efficient waste management .

34,"Other thinkers of the day took Charles Darwin ’ s theories in a more nuanced direction , focusing on different theories of realism that sought to understand the truth underlying the changes in the United States . These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted . Philosopher William James was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism , which held that Americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about American society , rather than assuming that there was truth in old , previously accepted models . Only by tying ideas , thoughts , and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth , according to James . His work strongly influenced the subsequent avant-garde and modernist movements in literature and art , especially in understanding the role of the observer , artist , or writer in shaping the society they attempted to observe . John Dewey built on the idea of pragmatism to create a theory of instrumentalism , which advocated the use of education in the search for truth . Dewey believed that education , specifically observation and change through the scientific method , was the best tool by which to reform and improve American society as it continued to grow ever more complex . To that end , Dewey strongly encouraged educational reforms designed to create an informed American citizenry that could then form the basis for other , much-needed progressive reforms in society .",0.9643351435661316,1.0,"[1.9665690127358242e-86, 1.0]"
34,"Novelists and journalists also popularized realism in literary works . Authors such as Stephen Crane , who wrote stark stories about life in the slums or during the Civil War , and Rebecca Harding Davis , who in 1861 published Life in the Iron Mills , embodied this popular style . Mark Twain also sought realism in his books , whether it was the reality of the pioneer spirit , seen in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , published in 1884 , or the issue of corruption in The Gilded Age , co-authored with Charles Dudley Warner in 1873 . The narratives and visual arts of these realists could nonetheless be highly stylized , crafted , and even fabricated , since their goal was the effective portrayal of social realities they thought required reform . Some authors , such as Jack London , who wrote The Call of the Wild , embraced a school of thought called naturalism , which concluded that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only truly relevant laws governing humanity ( Figure 19.17 ) . Kate Chopin , widely regarded as the foremost woman short story writer and novelist of her day , sought to portray a realistic view of women ’ s lives in late nineteenth-century America , thus paving the way for more explicit feminist literature in generations to come . Although Chopin never described herself as a feminist per se , her reflective works on her experiences as a southern woman introduced a form of creative nonfiction that captured the struggles of women in the United States through their own individual experiences . She also was among the first authors to openly address the race issue of miscegenation .

In this way , machines provided timely solutions for citizens and votes for the politicians .

Instead , store owners would approach the machine . A district captain would approach the “ boss ” and make him aware of the problem . The boss would contact city politicians and strongly urge them to appropriate the needed funds for the sidewalk in exchange for the promise that the boss would direct votes in their favor in the upcoming election . The boss then used the funds to pay one of his friends for the sidewalk construction , typically at an exorbitant cost , with a financial kickback to the boss , which was known as graft .

According to researchers at the Tuskegee Institute , there were thirty-five hundred racially motivated lynchings and other murders committed in the South between 1865 and 1900 .

Those middle-class and wealthier urbanites who enjoyed the costlier amenities presented by city life — including theaters , restaurants , and shopping — were free to escape to the suburbs , leaving behind the poorer working classes living in squalor and unsanitary conditions . Through the City Beautiful movement , leaders such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham sought to champion middle - and upper-class progressive reforms . They improved the quality of life for city dwellers , but also cultivated middle-class-dominated urban spaces in which Americans of different ethnicities , racial origins , and classes worked and lived .",0.4515289068222046,0.0,"[1.0, 3.43542160743862e-16]"

The following four innovations proved critical in shaping urbanization at the turn of the century : electric lighting , communication improvements , intracity transportation , and the rise of skyscrapers . As people migrated for the new jobs , they often struggled with the absence of basic urban infrastructures , such as better transportation , adequate housing , means of communication , and efficient sources of light and energy . Even the basic necessities , such as fresh water and proper sanitation — often taken for granted in the countryside — presented a greater challenge in urban life .",0.4191105663776397,1.0,"[1.0, 2.5419111097722254e-38]"

34,"However , such economic gains were offset by the higher cost of living in the North , especially in terms of rent , food costs , and other essentials . As a result , African Americans often found themselves living in overcrowded , unsanitary conditions , much like the tenement slums in which European immigrants lived in the cities . For newly arrived African Americans , even those who sought out the cities for the opportunities they provided , life in these urban centers was exceedingly difficult . They quickly learned that racial discrimination did not end at the Mason-Dixon Line , but continued to flourish in the North as well as the South . European immigrants , also seeking a better life in the cities of the United States , resented the arrival of the African Americans , whom they feared would compete for the same jobs or offer to work at lower wages . Landlords frequently discriminated against them ; their rapid influx into the cities created severe housing shortages and even more overcrowded tenements . Homeowners in traditionally White neighborhoods later entered into covenants in which they agreed not to sell to African American buyers ; they also often fled neighborhoods into which African Americans had gained successful entry . In addition , some bankers practiced mortgage discrimination , later known as “ redlining , ” in order to deny home loans to qualified buyers . Such pervasive discrimination led to a concentration of African Americans in some of the worst slum areas of most major metropolitan cities , a problem that remained ongoing throughout most of the twentieth century .",0.2070734053850174,0.0,"[1.0, 4.185183401003848e-40]"

Although he initially struggled to find the patronage and financial support required to develop a full-time literary career , Dunbar ’ s subsequent professional relationship with literary critic and Atlantic Monthly editor William Dean Howells helped to firmly cement his literary credentials as the foremost African American writer of his generation . As with Chopin and Harding , Dunbar ’ s writing highlighted parts of the American experience that were not well understood by the dominant demographic of the country .

These offerings provided an immediate escape from the squalor and difficulties of everyday life . As improved means of internal transportation developed , working-class residents could escape the city and experience one of the popular new forms of entertainment — the amusement park . For example , Coney Island on the Brooklyn shoreline consisted of several different amusement parks , the first of which opened in 1895 ( Figure 19.11 ) . At these parks , New Yorkers enjoyed wild rides , animal attractions , and large stage productions designed to help them forget the struggles of their working-day lives .

The proximity of the actual earnings to earnings forecasts suggests they were manipulated because of the vesting . 2 As Douglas R . Carmichael points out , “ public companies that fail to report quarterly earnings which meet or exceed analysts ’ expectations often experience a drop in their stock prices . This can lead to practices that sometimes include fraudulent overstatement of quarterly revenue . ” 3 If earnings meet or exceed expectations , a stock price can hit or surpass the vested stock price in the option . For company members with stock options , this could result in higher income . Thus , financial statements that align closely with analysts ’ estimates , rather than showing large projections above or below whisper-earnings , could indicate that accounting information has possibly been adjusted to meet the expected numbers .

36,"The electron transport system ( ETS ) is the last component involved in the process of cellular respiration ; it comprises a series of membrane-associated protein complexes and associated mobile accessory electron carriers ( Figure 8.15 ) . Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons from NADH and FADH 2 are passed rapidly from one ETS electron carrier to the next . These carriers can pass electrons along in the ETS because of their redox potential . For a protein or chemical to accept electrons , it must have a more positive redox potential than the electron donor . Therefore , electrons move from electron carriers with more negative redox potential to those with more positive redox potential . The four major classes of electron carriers involved in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic electron transport systems are the cytochrome s , flavoprotein s , iron-sulfur protein s , and the quinone s . In aerobic respiration , the final electron acceptor ( i . e . , the one having the most positive redox potential ) at the end of the ETS is an oxygen molecule ( O 2 ) that becomes reduced to water ( H 2 O ) by the final ETS carrier . This electron carrier , cytochrome oxidase , differs between bacterial types and can be used to differentiate closely related bacteria for diagnoses . For example , the gram-negative opportunist Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-negative cholera-causing Vibrio cholerae use cytochrome c oxidase , which can be detected by the oxidase test , whereas other gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae , like E . coli , are negative for this test because they produce different cytochrome oxidase types .",1.0102332830429075,1.0,"[0.0, 3.654032832833521e-91, 3.2979676062898904e-76, 1.5985042560422843e-61, 7.609428942915311e-72, 1.0]"

36,"A living cell must be able to handle the energy released during catabolism in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed . Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . ATP is often called the “ energy currency ” of the cell , and , like currency , this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell . At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) , which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and a single phosphate group . Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA , and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA . The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) ; the addition of a third phosphate group forms ATP ( Figure 8.3 ) . Adding a phosphate group to a molecule , a process called phosphorylation , requires energy . Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in series , as they are in ADP and ATP . This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable . Thus , the bonds between phosphate groups ( one in ADP and two in ATP ) are called high-energy phosphate bond s . When these high-energy bonds are broken to release one phosphate ( called inorganic phosphate [ P i ] ) or two connected phosphate groups ( called pyrophosphate [ PP i ] ) from ATP through a process called dephosphorylation , energy is released to drive endergonic reaction s ( Figure 8.4 ) .",0.9680768251419068,0.0,"[0.0, 1.842953888650834e-129, 6.603883466528513e-67, 6.759128954634566e-71, 5.913664757961475e-85, 1.0]"

Then , they can modify the flexible budget when they have their actual production volume and compare it to the flexible budget for the same production volume . A flexible budget is more complicated , requires a solid understanding of a company ’ s fixed and variable expenses , and allows for greater control over changes that occur throughout the year . For example , suppose a proposed sale of items does not occur because the expected client opted to go with another supplier . In a static budget situation , this would result in large variances in many accounts due to the static budget being set based on sales that included the potential large client . A flexible budget on the other hand would allow management to adjust their expectations in the budget for both changes in costs and revenue that would occur from the loss of the potential client .

The good life is achieved through identifying our unique skills and abilities and engaging these talents to enrich our lives ; those who achieve the good life often find themselves absorbed in their work or their recreational pursuits .

Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychological factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning . The term psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981 , when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewed available evidence for associations between the brain , endocrine system , and immune system ( Zacharie , 2009 ) .

39,"Good Stress ? Although stress carries a negative connotation , at times it may be of some benefit . Stress can motivate us to do things in our best interests , such as study for exams , visit the doctor regularly , exercise , and perform to the best of our ability at work . Indeed , Selye ( 1974 ) pointed out that not all stress is harmful . He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive , motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives . This kind of stress , which Selye called eustress ( from the Greek eu = “ good ” ) , is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings , optimal health , and performance . A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations . For example , athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress , and students may experience similar beneficial stress before a major exam . Indeed , research shows that moderate stress can enhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material . Male participants in one study who memorized a scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild stressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor ( Hupbach & Fieman , 2012 ) .",1.013370156288147,0.0,"[1.0491561958839101e-35, 1.0, 1.2157641146319033e-103]"

Qualities that help promote psychological well-being ( e . g . , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of autonomy , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes ( especially improved cardiovascular health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( Boehm & Kubzansky , 2012 ) . The quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment , such as happiness , joy , enthusiasm , alertness , and excitement ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) . The characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long-lasting , or trait-like ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) . Independent of age , gender , and income , positive affect is associated with greater social connectedness , emotional and practical support , adaptive coping efforts , and lower depression ; it is also associated with longevity and favorable physiological functioning ( Steptoe , O ’ Donnell , Marmot , & Wardle , 2008 ) .",1.0122923851013184,0.0,"[8.462465349823849e-55, 3.1433387578923787e-88, 1.0]"

Another technique to combat stress , biofeedback , was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University in the early 1970s . Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person ’ s neuromuscular and autonomic activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals . The main assumption of this approach is that providing somebody biofeedback will enable the individual to develop strategies that help gain some level of voluntary control over what are normally involuntary bodily processes ( Schwartz & Schwartz , 1995 ) . A number of different bodily measures have been used in biofeedback research , including facial muscle movement , brain activity , and skin temperature , and it has been applied successfully with individuals experiencing tension headaches , high blood pressure , asthma , and phobias ( Stein , 2001 ) . 14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",1.012075424194336,0.0,"[1.0, 1.472470593766766e-25, 3.0979556925872826e-106]"

Clearly , emotion-focused coping is more effective in dealing with uncontrollable stressors . For example , if at midnight you are stressing over a 40 - page paper due in the morning that you have not yet started , you are probably better off recognizing the hopelessness of the situation and doing something to take your mind off it ; taking a problem-focused approach by trying to accomplish this task would only lead to frustration , anxiety , and even more stress .",1.0113288164138794,1.0,"[1.3960694220522893e-11, 0.9999999999860165, 1.510740450482972e-107]"

The first dimension is exhaustion — a sense that one ’ s emotional resources are drained or that one is at the end of her rope and has nothing more to give at a psychological level . Second , job burnout is characterized by depersonalization : a sense of emotional detachment between the worker and the recipients of his services , often resulting in callous , cynical , or indifferent attitudes toward these individuals .

39,"In addition to anger and hostility , a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart disease , including negative affectivity and depression ( Suls & Bunde , 2005 ) . Negative affectivity is a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger , contempt , disgust , guilt , fear , and nervousness ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) . It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart disease . For example , over 3,000 initially healthy participants in one study were tracked longitudinally , up to 22 years . Those with higher levels of negative affectivity at the time the study began were substantially more likely to develop and be treated for hypertension during the ensuing years than were those with lower levels of negative affectivity ( Jonas & Lando , 2000 ) . In addition , a study of over 10,000 middle-aged London-based civil servants who were followed an average of 12.5 years revealed that those who earlier had scored in the upper third on a test of negative affectivity were 32 % more likely to have experienced heart disease , heart attack , or angina over a period of years than were those who scored in the lowest third ( Nabi , Kivimaki , De Vogli , Marmot , & Singh-Manoux , 2008 ) .

It has also been conceptualized as a tendency to view life ’ s stressors and difficulties as temporary and external to oneself ( Peterson & Steen , 2002 ) . Numerous studies over the years have consistently shown that optimism is linked to longevity , healthier behaviors , fewer postsurgical complications , better immune functioning among men with prostate cancer , and better treatment adherence ( Rasmussen & Wallio , 2008 ) .

39,"A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well-being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) . A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ); these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events . Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals . A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well-being that a stressor might entail . A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth . For example , an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as a much greater threat if she believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if she viewed it as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally . Similarly , a college student on the cusp of graduation may face the change as a threat or a challenge ( Figure 14.2 ) .",1.0080084800720217,0.0,"[2.306070343458282e-31, 1.0, 2.893896979268199e-119]"

According to this definition , environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they are interpreted and the meanings they are assigned .

First , many of the items on the SRRS are vague ; for example , death of a close friend could involve the death of a long-absent childhood friend that requires little social readjustment ( Dohrenwend , 2006 ) . In addition , some have challenged its assumption that undesirable life events are no more stressful than desirable ones ( Derogatis & Coons , 1993 ) . However , most of the available evidence suggests that , at least as far as mental health is concerned , undesirable or negative events are more strongly associated with poor outcomes ( such as depression ) than are desirable , positive events ( Hatch & Dohrenwend , 2007 ) . Perhaps the most serious criticism is that the scale does not take into consideration respondents ’ appraisals of the life events it contains . As you recall , appraisal of a stressor is a key element in the conceptualization and overall experience of stress . Being fired from work may be devastating to some but a welcome opportunity to obtain a better job for others .

39,"Another factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well-being is the ability to derive flow from the things we do in life . Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossing that it becomes worth doing for its own sake ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) . It is usually related to creative endeavors and leisure activities , but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who love studying ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1999 ) . Many of us instantly recognize the notion of flow . In fact , the term derived from respondents ’ spontaneous use of the term when asked to describe how it felt when what they were doing was going well . When people experience flow , they become involved in an activity to the point where they feel they lose themselves in the activity . They effortlessly maintain their concentration and focus , they feel as though they have complete control of their actions , and time seems to pass more quickly than usual ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) . Flow is considered a pleasurable experience , and it typically occurs when people are engaged in challenging activities that require skills and knowledge they know they possess . For example , people would be more likely report flow experiences in relation to their work or hobbies than in relation to eating . When asked the question , “ Do you ever get involved in something so deeply that nothing else seems to matter , and you lose track of time ? ” about 20 % of Americans and Europeans report having these flow-like experiences regularly ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) .",0.9920153617858888,0.0,"[1.0, 3.5679366703130524e-32, 3.387367432666872e-40]"

39,"Given the complex and pervasive nature of racism as a stressor , Brondolo et al . ( 2009 ) point out the importance of coping with this specific stressor . Their review is aimed at determining which coping strategies are most effective at offsetting negative health outcomes associated with racism-related stress . The authors examine the effectiveness of three coping strategies : focusing on racial identity to handle race-related stress , anger expression / suppression , and seeking social support . You ’ ve learned a bit about social support , so we ’ ll focus the remainder of this discussion on the potential coping strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression / suppression . Focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he belongs to a given racial group ; this may increase a sense of pride associated with group membership . Brondolo et al . ( 2009 ) suggest that a strong sense of racial identity might help an individual who is the target of racism differentiate between prejudicial attitudes / behaviors that are directed toward his group as a whole rather than at him as a person . Furthermore , the sense of belonging to his group might alleviate the distress of being ostracized by others . However , the research literature on the effectiveness of this technique has produced mixed results . Anger expression / suppression refers to the options available as a function of the anger evoked by racial prejudice and discrimination . Put simply , a target of racist attitudes and behaviors can act upon her anger or suppress her anger . As discussed by Brondolo et al . ( 2009 ) , there has been very little research on the effectiveness of either approach ; the results are quite mixed with some showing anger expression and others showing anger suppression as the healthier option .",0.986725389957428,0.0,"[1.0, 8.64131851254609e-21, 9.849972990548517e-86]"

Assume that the student makes an internal ( “ I ’ m just not smart ” ) , stable ( “ Nothing can be done to change the fact that I ’ m not smart ” ) and global ( “ This is another example of how lousy I am at everything ” ) attribution for the poor performance . The reformulated theory predicts that the student would perceive a lack of control over this stressful event and thus be especially prone to developing depression .

39,"The desire and ability to predict events , make decisions , and affect outcomes — that is , to enact control in our lives — is a basic tenet of human behavior ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) . Albert Bandura ( 1997 ) stated that “ the intensity and chronicity of human stress is governed largely by perceived control over the demands of one ’ s life ” ( p . 262 ) . As cogently described in his statement , our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things . Perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes , and it has major implications for our health and happiness ( Infurna & Gerstorf , 2014 ) . Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes , such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well-being ( Diehl & Hay , 2010 ) . Greater personal control is also associated with lower reactivity to stressors in daily life . For example , researchers in one investigation found that higher levels of perceived control at one point in time were later associated with lower emotional and physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors ( Neupert , Almeida , & Charles , 2007 ) .

Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends , family , and acquaintances ( Baron & Kerr , 2003 ) . Social support can take many forms , including advice , guidance , encouragement , acceptance , emotional comfort , and tangible assistance ( such as financial help ) . Thus , other people can be very comforting to us when we are faced with a wide range of life stressors , and they can be extremely helpful in our efforts to manage these challenges . Even in nonhuman animals , species mates can offer social support during times of stress .

39,"What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ? The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis . When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’ s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands . Release of these hormones activates the fight-or-flight responses to stress , such as accelerated heart rate and respiration . At the same time , the HPA axis , which is primarily endocrine in nature , becomes especially active , although it works much more slowly than the sympathetic nervous system . In response to stress , the hypothalamus ( one of the limbic structures in the brain ) releases corticotrophin-releasing factor , a hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) ( Figure 14.11 ) . The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream ; an important one is cortisol , which can affect virtually every organ within the body . Cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor , preparing us to run away or fight . However , sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system .",0.9642431735992432,1.0,"[8.991332398955341e-22, 1.0, 1.2169426180880096e-129]"
39,"Although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse , they seem to share two common denominators : heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job . Both of these factors contribute to job strain , a work situation that combines excessive job demands and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control ( Karasek & Theorell , 1990 ) . Clearly , many occupations other than the ones listed in Table 14.2 involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that they often involve heavy workloads and little job control ( e . g . , inability to decide when to take breaks ) . Such jobs are often low-status and include those of factory workers , postal clerks , supermarket cashiers , taxi drivers , and short-order cooks . Job strain can have adverse consequences on both physical and mental health ; it has been shown to be associated with increased risk of hypertension ( Schnall & Landsbergis , 1994 ) , heart attacks ( Theorell et al . , 1998 ) , recurrence of heart disease after a first heart attack ( Aboa-Éboulé et al . , 2007 ) , significant weight loss or gain ( Kivimäki et al . , 2006 ) , and major depressive disorder ( Stansfeld , Shipley , Head , & Fuhrer , 2012 ) .

39,"After reviewing and statistically summarizing 35 studies from 1983 to 2006 , Chida and Steptoe ( 2009 ) concluded that the bulk of the evidence suggests that anger and hostility constitute serious long-term risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes among both healthy individuals and those already suffering from heart disease . One reason angry and hostile moods might contribute to cardiovascular diseases is that such moods can create social strain , mainly in the form of antagonistic social encounters with others . This strain could then lay the foundation for disease-promoting cardiovascular responses among hostile individuals ( Vella , Kamarck , Flory , & Manuck , 2012 ) .

39,"In developing their scale , Holmes and Rahe asked 394 participants to provide a numerical estimate for each of the 43 items ; each estimate corresponded to how much readjustment participants felt each event would require . These estimates resulted in mean value scores for each event — often called life change units ( LCUs ) ( Rahe , McKeen , & Arthur , 1967 ) . The numerical scores ranged from 11 to 100 , representing the perceived magnitude of life change each event entails . Death of a spouse ranked highest on the scale with 100 LCUs , and divorce ranked second highest with 73 LCUs . In addition , personal injury or illness , marriage , and job termination also ranked highly on the scale with 53 , 50 , and 47 LCUs , respectively . Conversely , change in residence ( 20 LCUs ) , change in eating habits ( 15 LCUs ) , and vacation ( 13 LCUs ) ranked low on the scale ( Table 14.1 ) . Minor violations of the law ranked the lowest with 11 LCUs . To complete the scale , participants checked yes for events experienced within the last 12 months .

Some people , especially those who are highly committed to their religious faith , view happiness in ways that emphasize virtuosity , reverence , and enlightened spirituality . Others see happiness as primarily contentment — the inner peace and joy that come from deep satisfaction with one ’ s surroundings , relationships with others , accomplishments , and oneself . Still others view happiness mainly as pleasurable engagement with their personal environment — having a career and hobbies that are engaging , meaningful , rewarding , and exciting .

Perhaps buoyed by the perceived level of control , individuals of higher social class may be prone to overestimating the degree of influence they have over particular outcomes . For example , those of higher social class tend to believe that their votes have greater sway on election outcomes than do those of lower social class , which may explain higher rates of voting in more affluent communities ( Krosnick , 1990 ) .

At one point during your hike , a large , frightening-looking black bear appears from behind a stand of trees and sits about 50 yards from you . The bear notices you , sits up , and begins to lumber in your direction . In addition to thinking , “ This is definitely not good , ” a constellation of physiological reactions begins to take place inside you . Prompted by a deluge of epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) from your adrenal glands , your pupils begin to dilate . Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action . Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight-or-flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( Cannon , 1932 ) . During the fight-or-flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( Figure 14.8 ) .

Health psychology emerged as a discipline in the 1970s , a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestyle factors play in the development of illnesses and diseases ( Straub , 2007 ) . In addition to studying the connection between stress and illness , health psychologists investigate issues such as why people make certain lifestyle choices ( e . g . , smoking or eating unhealthy food despite knowing the potential adverse health implications of such behaviors ) . Health psychologists also design and investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at changing unhealthy behaviors . Perhaps one of the more fundamental tasks of health psychologists is to identify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes , based on psychological or behavioral factors .

39,"Can money buy happiness ? In general , extensive research suggests that the answer is yes , but with several caveats . While a nation ’ s per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) is associated with happiness levels ( Helliwell et al . , 2013 ) , changes in GDP ( which is a less certain index of household income ) bear little relationship to changes in happiness ( Diener , Tay , & Oishi , 2013 ) . On the whole , residents of affluent countries tend to be happier than residents of poor countries ; within countries , wealthy individuals are happier than poor individuals , but the association is much weaker ( Diener & Biswas-Diener , 2002 ) . To the extent that it leads to increases in purchasing power , increases in income are associated with increases in happiness ( Diener , Oishi , & Ryan , 2013 ) . However , income within societies appears to correlate with happiness only up to a point . In a study of over 450,000 U . S . residents surveyed by the Gallup Organization , Kahneman and Deaton ( 2010 ) found that well-being rises with annual income , but only up to $ 75,000 . The average increase in reported well-being for people with incomes greater than $ 75,000 was null . As implausible as these findings might seem — after all , higher incomes would enable people to indulge in Hawaiian vacations , prime seats as sporting events , expensive automobiles , and expansive new homes — higher incomes may impair people ’ s ability to savor and enjoy the small pleasures of life ( Kahneman , 2011 ) . Indeed , researchers in one study found that participants exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savoring a chocolate candy bar and exhibited less enjoyment of this experience than did participants who were not reminded of wealth ( Quoidbach , Dunn , Petrides , & Mikolajczak , 2010 ) .",0.8602833151817322,0.0,"[8.258348913290789e-67, 3.2223566385259355e-116, 1.0]"

For example , increases in cortisol can significantly weaken our immune system ( Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser , 2005 ) , and high levels are frequently observed among depressed individuals ( Geoffroy , Hertzman , Li , & Power , 2013 ) . In summary , a stressful event causes a variety of physiological reactions that activate the adrenal glands , which in turn release epinephrine , norepinephrine , and cortisol .

However , the taste of the water itself later produced immunosuppression ( a conditioned response ) , indicating that the immune system itself had been conditioned .

39,"Recently , some have raised questions concerning the extent to which important life events can permanently alter people ’ s happiness set points ( Diener , Lucas , & Scollon , 2006 ) . Evidence from a number of investigations suggests that , in some circumstances , happiness levels do not revert to their original positions . For example , although people generally tend to adapt to marriage so that it no longer makes them happier or unhappier than before , they often do not fully adapt to unemployment or severe disabilities ( Diener , 2012 ) . Figure 14.28 , which is based on longitudinal data from a sample of over 3,000 German respondents , shows life satisfaction scores several years before , during , and after various life events , and it illustrates how people adapt ( or fail to adapt ) to these events . German respondents did not get lasting emotional boosts from marriage ; instead , they reported brief increases in happiness , followed by quick adaptation . In contrast , widows and those who had been laid off experienced sizeable decreases in happiness that appeared to result in long-term changes in life satisfaction ( Diener et al . , 2006 ) . Further , longitudinal data from the same sample showed that happiness levels changed significantly over time for nearly a quarter of respondents , with 9 % showing major changes ( Fujita & Diener , 2005 ) .

39,"People with asthma tend to report and display a high level of negative emotions such as anxiety , and asthma attacks have been linked to periods of high emotionality ( Lehrer , Isenberg , & Hochron , 1993 ) . In addition , high levels of emotional distress during both laboratory tasks and daily life have been found to negatively affect airway function and can produce asthma-like symptoms in people with asthma ( von Leupoldt , Ehnes , & Dahme , 2006 ) . In one investigation , 20 adults with asthma wore preprogrammed wristwatches that signaled them to breathe into a portable device that measures airway function . Results showed that higher levels of negative emotions and stress were associated with increased airway obstruction and self-reported asthma symptoms ( Smyth , Soefer , Hurewitz , Kliment , & Stone , 1999 ) .

The indirect evidence includes data collected using ice cores , boreholes ( a narrow shaft bored into the ground ) , tree rings , glacier lengths , pollen remains , and ocean sediments . The data shows a correlation between the timing of temperature changes and drivers of climate change : before the Industrial Era ( pre - 1780 ) , there were three drivers of climate change that were not related to human activity or atmospheric gases . The first of these is the Milankovitch cycles . The Milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight changes in the Earth ’ s orbit on Earth ’ s climate . The length of the Milankovitch cycles ranges between 19,000 and 100,000 years .

40,"Temperature affects the physiology of living things as well as the density and state of water . Temperature exerts an important influence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) due to metabolic constraints . It is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ); this is a reflection of evolutionary response to typical temperatures . Enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range of temperatures ; enzyme degradation can occur at higher temperatures . Therefore , organisms either must maintain an internal temperature or they must inhabit an environment that will keep the body within a temperature range that supports metabolism . Some animals have adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations , such as seen in hibernation or reptilian torpor . Similarly , some bacteria are adapted to surviving in extremely hot temperatures such as geysers . Such bacteria are examples of extremophiles : organisms that thrive in extreme environments . Temperature can limit the distribution of living things . Animals faced with temperature fluctuations may respond with adaptations , such as migration , in order to survive . Migration , the movement from one place to another , is an adaptation found in many animals , including many that inhabit seasonally cold climates . Migration solves problems related to temperature , locating food , and finding a mate . In migration , for instance , the Arctic Tern ( Sterna paradisaea ) makes a 40,000 km ( 24,000 mi ) round trip flight each year between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding grounds in the Arctic Ocean . Monarch butterflies ( Danaus plexippus ) live in the eastern United States in the warmer months and migrate to Mexico and the southern United States in the wintertime . Some species of mammals also make migratory forays . Reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ) travel about 5,000 km ( 3,100 mi ) each year to find food . Amphibians and reptiles are more limited in their distribution because they lack migratory ability . Not all animals that can migrate do so : migration carries risk and comes at a high energy cost .",1.0074316263198853,0.0,"[4.504779161213108e-57, 1.0, 2.6519892907657778e-46]"
40,"Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate . When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth , gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere , as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping . The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide , methane , water vapor , nitrous oxide , and ozone . Approximately half of the radiation from the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the Earth . This radiation is converted into thermal radiation on the Earth ’ s surface , and then a portion of that energy is re-radiated back into the atmosphere . Greenhouse gases , however , reflect much of the thermal energy back to the Earth ’ s surface . The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere , the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth ’ s surface . Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect : the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature : as carbon dioxide rises , global temperature rises . Since 1950 , the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006 . In 2011 , the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was 392 ppm .

Generally , volcanic eruptions cool the climate . This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide . This led to haze-effect cooling , a global phenomenon that occurs when dust , ash , or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result ; haze-effect cooling usually extends for one or more years .

A third temperature anomaly aligns with the Industrial Era . The Medieval Climate Anomaly occurred between 900 and 1300 AD . During this time period , many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather conditions prevailed in many parts of the world ; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10 ° C and 0.20 ° C above the norm . Although 0.10 ° C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change , it did free seas of ice . Because of this warming , the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland . The Little Ice Age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD . During this time , a slight cooling of a little less than 1 ° C was observed in North America , Europe , and possibly other areas of the Earth . This 1 ° C change in global temperature is a seemingly small deviation in temperature ( as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly ); however , it also resulted in noticeable changes . Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost .

Zooplankton , protists , small fishes , and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the world ’ s fisheries . Beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ( Figure 44.21 ) . Within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents .

However , not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans , and I . scapularis can have other hosts besides deer . In fact , it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host upon which the tick develops : a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer .

An increase in revenues will also contribute toward an increase in retained earnings . Expenses are the cost of resources associated with earning revenues . An increase to expenses will contribute toward a decrease in retained earnings . Recall that this concept of recognizing expenses associated with revenues is the expense recognition principle . Some examples of expenses include bill payments for utilities , employee salaries , and loan interest expense . A business does not have an expense until it is “ incurred . ” Incurred means the resource is used or consumed . For example , you will not recognize utilities as an expense until you have used the utilities . The difference between revenues earned and expenses incurred is called net income ( loss ) and can be found on the income statement .",1.0128220319747925,1.0,"[2.0229965756466703e-75, 4.33187422569097e-49, 1.822731441212804e-52, 1.0, 4.0395912407123096e-53, 5.353796405576523e-113, 0.0, 1.1420608168239081e-74]"

The stomach produces mucus to protect its lining , as well as digestive enzymes and acid to break down food . Partially digested food then leaves the stomach through the pyloric sphincter , reaching the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum . Pancreatic juice , which includes enzymes and bicarbonate ions , is released into the small intestine to neutralize the acidic material from the stomach and to assist in digestion .

43,"The Pacific Railway Act was pivotal in helping settlers move west more quickly , as well as move their farm products , and later cattle and mining deposits , back east . The first of many railway initiatives , this act commissioned the Union Pacific Railroad to build new track west from Omaha , Nebraska , while the Central Pacific Railroad moved east from Sacramento , California . The law provided each company with ownership of all public lands within two hundred feet on either side of the track laid , as well as additional land grants and payment through load bonds , prorated on the difficulty of the terrain it crossed . Because of these provisions , both companies made a significant profit , whether they were crossing hundreds of miles of open plains , or working their way through the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California . As a result , the nation ’ s first transcontinental railroad was completed when the two companies connected their tracks at Promontory , Utah , in the spring of 1869 . Other tracks , including lines radiating from this original one , subsequently created a network that linked all corners of the nation ( Figure 17.4 ) . In addition to legislation designed to facilitate western settlement , the U . S . government assumed an active role on the ground , building numerous forts throughout the West to protect and assist settlers during their migration . Forts such as Fort Laramie in Wyoming ( built in 1834 ) and Fort Apache in Arizona ( 1870 ) served as protection from nearby Native Americans as well as maintained peace between potential warring tribes . Others located throughout Colorado and Wyoming became important trading posts for miners and fur trappers . Those built in Kansas , Nebraska , and the Dakotas served primarily to provide relief for farmers during times of drought or related hardships . Forts constructed along the California coastline provided protection in the wake of the Mexican-American War as well as during the American Civil War . These locations subsequently serviced the U .

Horses , livestock , wagons , wells , fencing , seed , and fertilizer were all critical to survival , but often hard to come by as the population initially remained sparsely settled across vast tracts of land . Railroads charged notoriously high rates for farm equipment and livestock , making it difficult to procure goods or make a profit on anything sent back east . Banks also charged high interest rates , and , in a cycle that replayed itself year after year , farmers would borrow from the bank with the intention of repaying their debt after the harvest . As the number of farmers moving westward increased , the market price of their produce steadily declined , even as the value of the actual land increased .

43,"Eventually , the arrival of a more extensive railroad network aided farmers , mostly by bringing much-needed supplies such as lumber for construction and new farm machinery .

His new , less expensive “ chilled plow ” was better equipped to cut through the shallow grass roots of the Midwestern terrain , as well as withstand damage from rocks just below the surface . Similar advancements in hay mowers , manure spreaders , and threshing machines greatly improved farm production for those who could afford them . Where capital expense became a significant factor , larger commercial farms — known as “ bonanza farms ” — began to develop . Farmers in Minnesota , North Dakota , and South Dakota hired migrant farmers to grow wheat on farms in excess of twenty thousand acres each . These large farms were succeeding by the end of the century , but small family farms continued to suffer . Although the land was nearly free , it cost close to $ 1000 for the necessary supplies to start up a farm , and many would-be landowners lured westward by the promise of cheap land became migrant farmers instead , working other peoples ’ land for a wage .

In addition , ranchers capitalized on newly available railroad lines to move longhorn steers that populated southern and western Texas . This meat was highly sought after in eastern markets , and the demand created not only wealthy ranchers but an era of cowboys and cattle drives that in many ways defines how we think of the West today . Although neither miners nor ranchers intended to remain permanently in the West , many individuals from both groups ultimately stayed and settled there , sometimes due to the success of their gamble , and other times due to their abject failure .",0.9936701655387878,0.0,"[1.0648643643053635e-28, 1.0]"
43,"As settlers sought more land for farming , mining , and cattle ranching , the first strategy employed to deal with the perceived "" Indian threat "" was to negotiate settlements to move tribes out of the path of White settlers . In 1851 , the chiefs of most of the Great Plains tribes agreed to the First Treaty of Fort Laramie . This agreement established distinct tribal borders , essentially codifying the reservation system . In return for annual payments of $ 50,000 to the tribes ( originally guaranteed for fifty years , but later revised to last for only ten ) as well as the hollow promise of noninterference from westward settlers , Native Americans agreed to stay clear of the path of settlement . Due to government corruption , many annuity payments never reached the tribes , and some reservations were left destitute and near starving . In addition , within a decade , as the pace and number of western settlers increased , even designated reservations became prime locations for farms and mining . Rather than negotiating new treaties , settlers — oftentimes backed by local or state militia units — simply attacked the tribes out of fear or to force them from the land . Some Indians resisted , only to then face massacres .",0.993057906627655,0.0,"[1.0, 8.523216156740161e-35]"
43,"To assist the settlers in their move westward and transform the migration from a trickle into a steady flow , Congress passed two significant pieces of legislation in 1862 : the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Act . Born largely out of President Abraham Lincoln ’ s growing concern that a potential Union defeat in the early stages of the Civil War might result in the expansion of slavery westward , Lincoln hoped that such laws would encourage the expansion of a “ free soil ” mentality across the West .",0.987579584121704,1.0,"[1.0, 6.077530521013677e-51]"
43,"A vital part of the assimilation effort was land reform . During earlier negotiations , the government had respected that the Native tribes used their land communally . Most Native American belief structures did not allow for the concept of individual land ownership ; rather , land was available for all to use , and required responsibility from all to protect it . As a part of their plan to Americanize the tribes , reformers sought legislation to replace this concept with the popular Euro-American notion of real estate ownership and self-reliance . One such law was the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 , named after a reformer and senator from Massachusetts , which struck a deadly blow to the Native American way of life . In what was essentially a new version of the original Homestead Act , the Dawes Act permitted the federal government to divide the lands of any tribe and grant 160 acres of farmland or 320 acres of grazing land to each head of family , with lesser amounts to single persons and others . In a nod towards the paternal relationship with which Whites viewed Native Americans — similar to the justification of the previous treatment of enslaved African Americans — the Dawes Act permitted the federal government to hold an individual Native American ’ s newly acquired land in trust for twenty-five years . Only then would they obtain full title and be granted the citizenship rights that land ownership entailed . It would not be until 1924 that formal citizenship was granted to all Native Americans . Under the Dawes Act , Native Americans were given the most arid , useless land . Further , inefficiencies and corruption in the government meant that much of the land due to be allotted to Native Americans was simply deemed “ surplus ” and claimed by settlers . Once all allotments were determined , the remaining tribal lands — as much as eighty million acres — were sold to White American settlers . The final element of “ Americanization ” was the symbolic “ last arrow ” pageant , which often coincided with the formal redistribution of tribal lands under the Dawes Act . At these events , Native Americans were forced to assemble in their tribal garb , carrying a bow and arrow . They would then symbolically fire their “ last arrow ” into the air , enter a tent where they would strip away their traditional clothing , dress in a White farmer ’ s coveralls , and emerge to take a plow and an American flag to show that they had converted to a new way of life . It was a seismic shift for the Native Americans , and one that left them bereft of their culture and history . 17.5 The Impact of Expansion on Chinese Immigrants and Hispanic Citizens Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9872803688049316,1.0,"[1.0, 9.530008797167467e-46]"

Abilene , Kansas , is one example of a lawless town , replete with prostitutes , gambling , and other vices , transformed when middle-class women arrived in the 1880s with their cattle baron husbands . These women began to organize churches , school , civic clubs , and other community programs to promote family values . They fought to remove opportunities for prostitution and all the other vices that they felt threatened the values that they held dear . Protestant missionaries eventually joined the women in their efforts , and , while they were not widely successful , they did bring greater attention to the problems . As a response , the U . S . Congress passed both the Comstock Law ( named after its chief proponent , anti-obscenity crusader Anthony Comstock ) in 1873 to ban the spread of “ lewd and lascivious literature ” through the mail and the subsequent Page Act of 1875 to prohibit the transportation of women into the United States for employment as prostitutes .

The weather and environment were bleak , and settlers struggled to eke out a living . A few unseasonably rainy years had led would-be settlers to believe that the “ great desert ” was no more , but the region ’ s typically low rainfall and harsh temperatures made crop cultivation hard . Irrigation was a requirement , but finding water and building adequate systems proved too difficult and expensive for many farmers . It was not until 1902 and the passage of the Newlands Reclamation Act that a system finally existed to set aside funds from the sale of public lands to build dams for subsequent irrigation efforts . Prior to that , farmers across the Great Plains relied primarily on dry-farming techniques to grow corn , wheat , and sorghum , a practice that many continued in later years .

In 1889 – 1890 in New Mexico , several hundred Mexican Americans formed las Gorras Blancas ( the White Caps ) to try and reclaim their land and intimidate White Americans , preventing further land seizures . White Caps conducted raids of White farms , burning homes , barns , and crops to express their growing anger and frustration . However , their actions never resulted in any fundamental changes . Several White Caps were captured , beaten , and imprisoned , whereas others eventually gave up , fearing harsh reprisals against their families . Some White Caps adopted a more political strategy , gaining election to local offices throughout New Mexico in the early 1890s , but growing concerns over the potential impact upon the territory ’ s quest for statehood led several citizens to heighten their repression of the movement . Other laws passed in the United States intended to deprive Mexican Americans of their heritage as much as their lands . “ Sunday Laws ” prohibited “ noisy amusements ” such as bullfights , cockfights , and other cultural gatherings common to Hispanic communities at the time . “ Greaser Laws ” permitted the imprisonment of any unemployed Mexican American on charges of vagrancy . Although Hispanic Americans held tightly to their cultural heritage as their remaining form of self-identity , such laws did take a toll .

43,"Despite this grim image , the challenges of farm life eventually empowered women to break through some legal and social barriers .

If widowed , a wife typically took over responsibility for the farm , a level of management that was very rare back east , where the farm would fall to a son or other male relation . Pioneer women made important decisions and were considered by their husbands to be more equal partners in the success of the homestead , due to the necessity that all members had to work hard and contribute to the farming enterprise for it to succeed . Therefore , it is not surprising that the first states to grant women ’ s rights , including the right to vote , were those in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest , where women pioneers worked the land side by side with men .

S . government seizing the land during its war with Mexico ( 1846 – 1848 ) . The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , which ended the war in 1848 , granted American citizenship to those who chose to stay in the United States , as the land switched from Mexican to U . S . ownership . Under the conditions of the treaty , Mexicans retained the right to their language , religion , and culture , as well as the property they held . As for citizenship , they could choose one of three options : 1 ) declare their intent to live in the United States but retain Mexican citizenship ; 2 ) become U .

43,"As settlers and homesteaders moved westward to improve the land given to them through the Homestead Act , they faced a difficult and often insurmountable challenge . The land was difficult to farm , there were few building materials , and harsh weather , insects , and inexperience led to frequent setbacks . The prohibitive prices charged by the first railroad lines made it expensive to ship crops to market or have goods sent out . Although many farms failed , some survived and grew into large “ bonanza ” farms that hired additional labor and were able to benefit enough from economies of scale to grow profitable . Still , small family farms , and the settlers who worked them , were hard-pressed to do more than scrape out a living in an unforgiving environment that comprised arid land , violent weather shifts , and other challenges ( Figure 17.6 ) .",0.3032015860080719,0.0,"[0.9997681607224111, 0.00023183927755369662]"

Some mining towns were indeed as rough as the popular stereotype . Men , money , liquor , and disappointment were a recipe for violence . Fights were frequent , deaths were commonplace , and frontier justice reigned . The notorious mining town of Bodie , California , had twenty-nine murders between 1877 and 1883 , which translated to a murder rate higher than any other city at that time , and only one person was ever convicted of a crime . The most prolific gunman of the day was John Wesley Hardin , who allegedly killed over twenty men in Texas in various gunfights , including one victim he killed in a hotel for snoring too loudly ( Figure 17.12 ) .",0.2707068920135498,0.0,"[4.11788151102753e-36, 1.0]"
43,"In 1862 , frustrated and angered by the lack of annuity payments and the continuous encroachment on their reservation lands , Dakota Sioux in Minnesota rebelled in what became known as the Dakota War or the War of 1862 , killing the White settlers who moved onto their tribal lands . Over one thousand White settlers were captured or killed in the attack , before an armed militia regained control . Of the four hundred Sioux captured by U . S . troops , 303 were sentenced to death , but President Lincoln intervened , releasing all but thirty-eight of the men . The thirty-eight who were found guilty were hanged in the largest mass execution in the country ’ s history , and the rest of the tribe was banished . Settlers in other regions responded to news of this raid with fear and aggression . In Colorado , Arapahoe and Cheyenne tribes fought back against land encroachment ; White militias then formed , decimating even some of the tribes that were willing to cooperate . One of the more vicious examples was near Sand Creek , Colorado , where Colonel John Chivington led a militia raid upon a camp in which the leader had already negotiated a peaceful settlement . The camp was flying both the American flag and the white flag of surrender when Chivington ’ s troops murdered close to one hundred people , the majority of them women and children , in what became known as the Sand Creek Massacre . For the rest of his life , Chivington would proudly display his collection of nearly one hundred Native American scalps from that day . Subsequent investigations by the U . S . Army condemned Chivington ’ s tactics and their results ; however , the raid served as a model for some settlers who sought any means by which to eradicate the perceived Indian threat .",0.2687766849994659,0.0,"[1.0, 5.996903087941688e-27]"
43,"The final episode in the so-called Indian Wars occurred in 1890 , at the Wounded Knee Massacre in South Dakota . On their reservation , the Lakota Sioux had begun to perform the “ Ghost Dance , ” which told of a Messiah who would deliver the tribe from its hardship , with such frequency that White settlers began to worry that another uprising would occur . The militia prepared to round up the Sioux . The tribe , after the death of Sitting Bull , who had been arrested , shot , and killed in 1890 , prepared to surrender at Wounded Knee , South Dakota , on December 29 , 1890 . Although the accounts are unclear , an apparent accidental rifle discharge by a young male Lakota preparing to lay down his weapon led the U . S . soldiers to begin firing indiscriminately upon the Native Americans . What little resistance the Lakota mounted with a handful of concealed rifles at the outset of the fight diminished quickly , with the troops eventually massacring between 150 and 300 men , women , and children . The U . S . troops suffered twenty-five fatalities , some of which were the result of their own crossfire . Captain Edward Godfrey of the Seventh Cavalry later commented , “ I know the men did not aim deliberately and they were greatly excited . I don ’ t believe they saw their sights . They fired rapidly but it seemed to me only a few seconds till there was not a living thing before us ; warriors , squaws , children , ponies , and dogs . . . went down before that unaimed fire . ” With this last show of brutality , the Indian Wars came to a close . U . S . government officials had already begun the process of seeking an alternative to the meaningless treaties and costly battles . A more effective means with which to address the public perception of the “ Indian threat ” was needed . Americanization provided the answer .",0.2052388340234756,0.0,"[1.0, 8.574059135023181e-22]"
43,"While a small number of settlers had pushed westward before the mid-nineteenth century , the land west of the Mississippi was largely unexplored . Most Americans , if they thought of it at all , viewed this territory as an arid wasteland suitable only for Indians whom the federal government had displaced from eastern lands in previous generations . The reflections of early explorers who conducted scientific treks throughout the West tended to confirm this belief . Major Stephen Harriman Long , who commanded an expedition through Missouri and into the Yellowstone region in 1819 – 1820 , frequently described the Great Plains as a arid and useless region , suitable as nothing more than a “ great American desert . ” But , beginning in the 1840s , a combination of economic opportunity and ideological encouragement changed the way Americans thought of the West . The federal government offered a number of incentives , making it viable for Americans to take on the challenge of seizing these rough lands from others and subsequently taming them . Still , most Americans who went west needed some financial security at the outset of their journey ; even with government aid , the truly poor could not make the trip . The cost of moving an entire family westward , combined with the risks as well as the questionable chances of success , made the move prohibitive for most . While the economic Panic of 1837 led many to question the promise of urban America , and thus turn their focus to the promise of commercial farming in the West , the Panic also resulted in many lacking the financial resources to make such a commitment . For most , the dream to “ Go west , young man ” remained unfulfilled .",0.1979192346334457,0.0,"[1.0, 5.111059800986143e-25]"

At the end of the Civil War , as many as five million longhorn steers could be found along the Texas frontier , yet few settlers had capitalized on the opportunity to claim them , due to the difficulty of transporting them to eastern markets . The completion of the first transcontinental railroad and subsequent railroad lines changed the game dramatically .

45,"As is true for all waves , there are four main characteristics of a sound wave : frequency , wavelength , period , and amplitude . Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time , and in sound is heard as pitch . High-frequency ( ≥ 15.000 Hz ) sounds are higher-pitched ( short wavelength ) than low-frequency ( long wavelengths ; ≤ 100Hz ) sounds . Frequency is measured in cycles per second , and for sound , the most commonly used unit is hertz ( Hz ) , or cycles per second . Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz .

45,"Detecting a taste ( gustation ) is fairly similar to detecting an odor ( olfaction ) , given that both taste and smell rely on chemical receptors being stimulated by certain molecules . The primary organ of taste is the taste bud . A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae ( singular : papilla ) ( illustrated in Figure 36.10 ) . There are several structurally distinct papillae . Filiform papillae , which are located across the tongue , are tactile , providing friction that helps the tongue move substances , and contain no taste cells . In contrast , fungiform papillae , which are located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue , each contain one to eight taste buds and also have receptors for pressure and temperature . The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a V near the posterior margin of the tongue . In addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae — leaf-like papillae located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue , as seen in the Figure 36.10 micrograph . Foliate papillae contain about 1,300 taste buds within their folds . Finally , there are circumvallate papillae , which are wall-like papillae in the shape of an inverted “ V ” at the back of the tongue . Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds . Each taste bud ’ s taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days . These are elongated cells with hair-like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore ( illustrate in Figure 36.11 ) .

45,"Sensory receptors are classified into five categories : mechanoreceptors , thermoreceptors , proprioceptors , pain receptors , and chemoreceptors . These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces . What is commonly referred to as “ touch ” involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor . Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated ( that is , surrounded by a capsule ) or unencapsulated ( a group that includes free nerve endings ) . A free nerve ending , as its name implies , is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron . Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin , and they extend into the middle of the epidermis . Free nerve endings are sensitive to painful stimuli , to hot and cold , and to light touch . They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive to abrupt changes in stimulation . There are three classes of mechanoreceptors : tactile , proprioceptors , and baroreceptors . Mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due to physical deformation of their plasma membranes . They contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or close in response to pressure , touch , stretching , and sound . ” There are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin : Merkel ’ s disks , Meissner ’ s corpuscles , Ruffini endings , and Pacinian corpuscle ; two are located toward the surface of the skin and two are located deeper . A fifth type of mechanoreceptor , Krause end bulbs , are found only in specialized regions . Merkel ’ s disks ( shown in Figure 36.5 ) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis , both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin , that is , the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers , the soles of the feet , and the lips of humans and other primates . Merkel ’ s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips . They are slow-adapting , encapsulated nerve endings , and they respond to light touch . Light touch , also known as discriminative touch , is a light pressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed .

45,"Senses provide information about the body and its environment . Humans have five special senses : olfaction ( smell ) , gustation ( taste ) , equilibrium ( balance and body position ) , vision , and hearing . Additionally , we possess general senses , also called somatosensation , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and vibration . Vestibular sensation , which is an organism ’ s sense of spatial orientation and balance , proprioception ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia ( limb movement ) are part of somatosensation . Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system . This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction . In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus . Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron , which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system . In the second type of sensory transduction , a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment : this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor . Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli , thus showing little receptor specificity .

45,"In mammals , sound waves are collected by the external , cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna , then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum , the innermost part of the outer ear ( illustrated in Figure 36.13 ) . Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear . The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear . The three ossicles are the malleus ( also known as the hammer ) , the incus ( the anvil ) , and stapes ( the stirrup ) . The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup .

The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes . In humans , the stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum . If we did not have the malleus and the incus , then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear . These bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds . The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth : the bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time .

They number approximately 12,000 , and they function to fine tune incoming sound waves . The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane . All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors , and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel ( refer to Figure 36.2 ) . As a result , the hair cell membrane is depolarized , and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve . Intensity ( volume ) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated . The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way . The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions , according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it . Likewise , the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a specific frequency of sound waves . Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies , but they require stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range . The difference in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent . Compare that to adjacent piano strings , which are about six percent different . Place theory , which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear , states that high frequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port ( the oval window ) . Lower frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane . The basic pitch-determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated . The place theory is the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception . Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear , it is thought that there must be some auditory “ sharpening ” mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution .",0.9959942102432252,1.0,"[2.0217600792374304e-54, 5.14278650130024e-81, 1.0]"

45,"Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity . That is , they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light .

In the absence of light , the bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones . Exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells . The now active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells , which send action potentials along their axons ( which leave the eye as the optic nerve ) . Thus , the visual system relies on change in retinal activity , rather than the absence or presence of activity , to encode visual signals for the brain . Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells .

46,"Sickle-cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes . For example , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts . If someone with this condition goes untreated , he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function , seizures , and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders . Because PKU is a recessive trait , each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order to produce a child with the condition ( Figure 3.6 ) . So far , we have discussed traits that involve just one gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene . Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene . Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from ? Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes . A mutation is a sudden , permanent change in a gene . While many mutations can be harmful or lethal , once in a while , a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation . Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations . In order for this process to occur , there must be competition — more technically , there must be variability in genes ( and resultant traits ) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment . If a population consisted of identical individuals , then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way , and there would be no variation in selection . In contrast , diversity in genes and associated traits allows some individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change .

46,"Genetic variation , the genetic difference between individuals , is what contributes to a species ’ adaptation to its environment . In humans , genetic variation begins with an egg , about 100 million sperm , and fertilization . Fertile women ovulate roughly once per month , releasing an egg from follicles in the ovary . During the egg's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes . Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs . In each chromosome , sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics , known as traits , such as eye color , hair color , and so on . A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles . An allele is a specific version of a gene . So , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has . When a sperm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes . Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) . A person ’ s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual . Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’ s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( Figure 3.4 ) . Most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by one gene . A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent . In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b . ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele . When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele . When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous . For example , smooth chin is a recessive trait , which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele ( bb ) . Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin . What type of chin will their child have ? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries . If the woman is homozygous for cleft chin ( BB ) , her offspring will always have cleft chin . It gets a little more complicated , however , if the mother is heterozygous for this gene ( Bb ) . Since the father has a smooth chin — therefore homozygous for the recessive allele ( bb ) — we can expect the offspring to have a 50 % chance of having a cleft chin and a 50 % chance of having a smooth chin ( Figure 3.5 ) .",0.9924240112304688,1.0,"[4.398517692597791e-200, 6.233991192893643e-40, 1.0]"

46,"Genes do not exist in a vacuum . Although we are all biological organisms , we also exist in an environment that is incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves , but also in what combination . Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction . Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall . For example , if an individual ’ s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation . According to the concept of range of reaction , genes set definite limits on potential , and environment determines how much of that potential is achieved . Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person ’ s potential . Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic environmental correlation . Stated simply , our genes influence our environment , and our environment influences the expression of our genes ( Figure 3.7 ) . Not only do our genes and environment interact , as in range of reaction , but they also influence one another bidirectionally . For example , the child of an NBA player would probably be exposed to basketball from an early age . Such exposure might allow the child to realize his or her full genetic , athletic potential . Thus , the parents ’ genes , which the child shares , influence the child ’ s environment , and that environment , in turn , is well suited to support the child ’ s genetic potential . In another approach to gene-environment interactions , the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways . In other words , researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes . As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious . For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings ) . But even with identical genes , there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin ’ s life . Sometimes , one twin will develop a disease and the other will not . In one example , Tiffany , an identical twin , died from cancer at age 7 , but her twin , now 19 years old , has never had cancer . Although these individuals share an identical genotype , their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is expressed over time . The epigenetic perspective is very different from range of reaction , because here the genotype is not fixed and limited .

To understand how this works , let ’ s consider an example . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , an autoimmune disorder , involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout the nervous system .

46,"Between signals , the neuron membrane ’ s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential . Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i . e . , a sodium-potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) . Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas , and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge . In the resting state , sodium ( Na + ) is at higher concentrations outside the cell , so it will tend to move into the cell . Potassium ( K + ) , on the other hand , is more concentrated inside the cell , and will tend to move out of the cell ( Figure 3.10 ) . In addition , the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside . This provides an additional force on sodium , causing it to move into the cell . From this resting potential state , the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly ( Figure 3.11 ) . When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites — due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding to its receptors — small pores , or gates , open on the neuronal membrane , allowing Na + ions , propelled by both charge and concentration differences , to move into the cell . With this influx of positive ions , the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive . If that charge reaches a certain level , called the threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . Many additional pores open , causing a massive influx of Na + ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential , the peak action potential . At the peak of the spike , the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open . As positively charged potassium ions leave , the cell quickly begins repolarization . At first , it hyperpolarizes , becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential , and then it levels off , returning to the resting potential . This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals . The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions . The action potential moves all the way down the axon to the terminal buttons .",0.8836096525192261,1.0,"[0.0, 1.0, 1.18697689397352e-28]"

Megakaryocytes are descended from myeloid stem cells ( see Figure 18.4 ) and are large , typically 50 – 100 µ m in diameter , and contain an enlarged , lobed nucleus . As noted earlier , thrombopoietin , a glycoprotein secreted by the kidneys and liver , stimulates the proliferation of megakaryoblasts , which mature into megakaryocytes . These remain within bone marrow tissue ( Figure 18.12 ) and ultimately form platelet-precursor extensions that extend through the walls of bone marrow capillaries to release into the circulation thousands of cytoplasmic fragments , each enclosed by a bit of plasma membrane . These enclosed fragments are platelets . Each megakarocyte releases 2000 – 3000 platelets during its lifespan . Following platelet release , megakaryocyte remnants , which are little more than a cell nucleus , are consumed by macrophages . Platelets are relatively small , 2 – 4 µ m in diameter , but numerous , with typically 150,000 – 160,000 per µ L of blood . After entering the circulation , approximately one-third migrate to the spleen for storage for later release in response to any rupture in a blood vessel .

48,"Erythrocytes are biconcave disks ; that is , they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center ( Figure 18.6 ) .

The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur , relative to its volume ; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio . In the capillaries , the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells , whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes . Capillary beds are extremely narrow , slowing the passage of the erythrocytes and providing an extended opportunity for gas exchange to occur . However , the space within capillaries can be so minute that , despite their own small size , erythrocytes may have to fold in on themselves if they are to make their way through .

Thus , the body must form new blood cells and platelets quickly and continuously . When you donate a unit of blood during a blood drive ( approximately 475 mL , or about 1 pint ) , your body typically replaces the donated plasma within 24 hours , but it takes about 4 to 6 weeks to replace the blood cells .

48,"To avoid transfusion reactions , it is best to transfuse only matching blood types ; that is , a type B + recipient should ideally receive blood only from a type B + donor and so on . That said , in emergency situations , when acute hemorrhage threatens the patient ’ s life , there may not be time for cross matching to identify blood type . In these cases , blood from a universal donor — an individual with type O − blood — may be transfused . Recall that type O erythrocytes do not display A or B antigens . Thus , anti-A or anti-B antibodies that might be circulating in the patient ’ s blood plasma will not encounter any erythrocyte surface antigens on the donated blood and therefore will not be provoked into a response . One problem with this designation of universal donor is if the O − individual had prior exposure to Rh antigen , Rh antibodies may be present in the donated blood . Also , introducing type O blood into an individual with type A , B , or AB blood will nevertheless introduce antibodies against both A and B antigens , as these are always circulating in the type O blood plasma . This may cause problems for the recipient , but because the volume of blood transfused is much lower than the volume of the patient ’ s own blood , the adverse effects of the relatively few infused plasma antibodies are typically limited .
