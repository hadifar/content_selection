0,"“ Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? ” first appeared in 1932 , written for the Broadway musical New Americana by Jay Gorney , a composer who based the song ’ s music on a Russian lullaby , and Edgar Yipsel “ Yip ” Harburg , a lyricist who would go on to win an Academy Award for the song “ Over the Rainbow ” from The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) . With its lyrics speaking to the plight of the common man during the Great Depression and the refrain appealing to the same sense of community later found in the films of Frank Capra , “ Brother , Can You Spare a Dime ? ” quickly became the de facto anthem of the Great Depression . Recordings by Bing Crosby , Al Jolson , and Rudy Vallee all enjoyed tremendous popularity in the 1930s .",0.7712855935096741,0.0

0,"Yet , to listen to Hoover ’ s later reflections on Franklin Roosevelt ’ s first term in office , one could easily mistake his vision for America for the one held by his successor . Speaking in 1936 before an audience in Denver , Colorado , he acknowledged that it was always his intent as president to ensure “ a nation built of home owners and farm owners . We want to see more and more of them insured against death and accident , unemployment and old age , ” he declared . “ We want them all secure . ” 1 Such humanitarianism was not uncommon to Hoover . Throughout his early career in public service , he was committed to relief for people around the world . In 1900 , he coordinated relief efforts for foreign nationals trapped in China during the Boxer Rebellion . At the outset of World War I , he led the food relief effort in Europe , specifically helping millions of Belgians who faced German forces . President Woodrow Wilson subsequently appointed him head of the U . S . Food Administration to coordinate rationing efforts in America as well as to secure essential food items for the Allied forces and citizens in Europe . 1 Herbert Hoover , address delivered in Denver , Colorado , 30 October 1936 , compiled in Hoover , Addresses Upon the American Road , 1933-1938 ( New York , 1938 ) , p . 216 .

0,"Women ’ s lives , too , were profoundly affected . Some wives and mothers sought employment to make ends meet , an undertaking that was often met with strong resistance from husbands and potential employers . Many men derided and criticized women who worked , feeling that jobs should go to unemployed men . Some campaigned to keep companies from hiring married women , and an increasing number of school districts expanded the long-held practice of banning the hiring of married female teachers . Despite the pushback , women entered the workforce in increasing numbers , from ten million at the start of the Depression to nearly thirteen million by the end of the 1930s . This increase took place in spite of the twenty-six states that passed a variety of laws to prohibit the employment of married women . Several women found employment in the emerging pink collar occupations , viewed as traditional women ’ s work , including jobs as telephone operators , social workers , and secretaries . Others took jobs as maids and housecleaners , working for those fortunate few who had maintained their wealth .",0.025272268801927567,0.0

0,"White women ’ s forays into domestic service came at the expense of minority women , who had even fewer employment options . Unsurprisingly , African American men and women experienced unemployment , and the grinding poverty that followed , at double and triple the rates of their White counterparts . By 1932 , unemployment among African Americans reached near 50 percent . In rural areas , where large numbers of African Americans continued to live despite the Great Migration of 1910 – 1930 , depression-era life represented an intensified version of the poverty that they traditionally experienced . Subsistence farming allowed many African Americans who lost either their land or jobs working for White landholders to survive , but their hardships increased . Life for African Americans in urban settings was equally trying , with Blacks and working-class Whites living in close proximity and competing for scarce jobs and resources .",0.8941697478294373,0.0

0,"Upon his inauguration , President Hoover set forth an agenda that he hoped would continue the “ Coolidge prosperity ” of the previous administration . While accepting the Republican Party ’ s presidential nomination in 1928 , Hoover commented , “ Given the chance to go forward with the policies of the last eight years , we shall soon with the help of God be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this nation forever . ” In the spirit of normalcy that defined the Republican ascendancy of the 1920s , Hoover planned to immediately overhaul federal regulations with the intention of allowing the nation ’ s economy to grow unfettered by any controls . The role of the government , he contended , should be to create a partnership with the American people , in which the latter would rise ( or fall ) on their own merits and abilities . He felt the less government intervention in their lives , the better .",0.691883385181427,0.0
0,"Unable to receive aid from the government , Americans thus turned to private charities ; churches , synagogues , and other religious organizations ; and state aid . But these organizations were not prepared to deal with the scope of the problem . Private aid organizations showed declining assets as well during the Depression , with fewer Americans possessing the ability to donate to such charities . Likewise , state governments were particularly ill-equipped . Governor Franklin D . Roosevelt was the first to institute a Department of Welfare in New York in 1929 . City governments had equally little to offer . In New York City in 1932 , family allowances were $ 2.39 per week , and only one-half of the families who qualified actually received them . In Detroit , allowances fell to fifteen cents a day per person , and eventually ran out completely . In most cases , relief was only in the form of food and fuel ; organizations provided nothing in the way of rent , shelter , medical care , clothing , or other necessities . There was no infrastructure to support the elderly , who were the most vulnerable , and this population largely depended on their adult children to support them , adding to families ’ burdens ( Figure 25.8 ) .",0.9600790739059448,0.0
0,"To understand the crash , it is useful to address the decade that preceded it . The prosperous 1920s ushered in a feeling of euphoria among middle-class and wealthy Americans , and people began to speculate on wilder investments . The government was a willing partner in this endeavor : The Federal Reserve followed a brief postwar recession in 1920 – 1921 with a policy of setting interest rates artificially low , as well as easing the reserve requirements on the nation ’ s largest banks . As a result , the money supply in the U . S . increased by nearly 60 percent , which convinced even more Americans of the safety of investing in questionable schemes . They felt that prosperity was boundless and that extreme risks were likely tickets to wealth . Named for Charles Ponzi , the original “ Ponzi schemes ” emerged early in the 1920s to encourage novice investors to divert funds to unfounded ventures , which in reality simply used new investors ’ funds to pay off older investors as the schemes grew in size . Speculation , where investors purchased into high-risk schemes that they hoped would pay off quickly , became the norm . Several banks , including deposit institutions that originally avoided investment loans , began to offer easy credit , allowing people to invest , even when they lacked the money to do so . An example of this mindset was the Florida land boom of the 1920s : Real estate developers touted Florida as a tropical paradise and investors went all in , buying land they had never seen with money they didn ’ t have and selling it for even higher prices .",0.9774889945983887,0.0

0,"The stock market crash of October 1929 set the Great Depression into motion , but other factors were at the root of the problem , propelled onward by a series of both human-made and natural catastrophes . Anticipating a short downturn and living under an ethos of free enterprise and individualism , Americans suffered mightily in the first years of the Depression . As conditions worsened and the government failed to act , they grew increasingly desperate for change . While Hoover could not be blamed for the Great Depression , his failure to address the nation ’ s hardships would remain his legacy .",0.035269126296043396,0.0

0,"The promise of the Hoover administration was cut short when the stock market lost almost one-half its value in the fall of 1929 , plunging many Americans into financial ruin . However , as a singular event , the stock market crash itself did not cause the Great Depression that followed . In fact , only approximately 10 percent of American households held stock investments and speculated in the market ; yet nearly a third would lose their lifelong savings and jobs in the ensuing depression . The connection between the crash and the subsequent decade of hardship was complex , involving underlying weaknesses in the economy that many policymakers had long ignored .",0.019069354981184006,0.0
0,"The hardships of the Great Depression threw family life into disarray . Both marriage and birth rates declined in the decade after the crash . The most vulnerable members of society — children , women , minorities , and the working class — struggled the most . Parents often sent children out to beg for food at restaurants and stores to save themselves from the disgrace of begging . Many children dropped out of school , and even fewer went to college . Childhood , as it had existed in the prosperous twenties , was over . And yet , for many children living in rural areas where the affluence of the previous decade was not fully developed , the Depression was not viewed as a great challenge . School continued . Play was simple and enjoyed . Families adapted by growing more in gardens , canning , and preserving , wasting little food if any . Home-sewn clothing became the norm as the decade progressed , as did creative methods of shoe repair with cardboard soles . Yet , one always knew of stories of the “ other ” families who suffered more , including those living in cardboard boxes or caves . By one estimate , as many as 200,000 children moved about the country as vagrants due to familial disintegration .",0.07877218723297119,0.0
0,"The financial outcome of the crash was devastating . Between September 1 and November 30 , 1929 , the stock market lost over one-half its value , dropping from $ 64 billion to approximately $ 30 billion . Any effort to stem the tide was , as one historian noted , tantamount to bailing Niagara Falls with a bucket . The crash affected many more than the relatively few Americans who invested in the stock market . While only 10 percent of households had investments , over 90 percent of all banks had invested in the stock market . Many banks failed due to their dwindling cash reserves . This was in part due to the Federal Reserve lowering the limits of cash reserves that banks were traditionally required to hold in their vaults , as well as the fact that many banks invested in the stock market themselves . Eventually , thousands of banks closed their doors after losing all of their assets , leaving their customers penniless . While a few savvy investors got out at the right time and eventually made fortunes buying up discarded stock , those success stories were rare . Housewives who speculated with grocery money , bookkeepers who embezzled company funds hoping to strike it rich and pay the funds back before getting caught , and bankers who used customer deposits to follow speculative trends all lost . While the stock market crash was the trigger , the lack of appropriate economic and banking safeguards , along with a public psyche that pursued wealth and prosperity at all costs , allowed this event to spiral downward into a depression .",0.035973720252513885,0.0
0,"The damage to major industries led to , and reflected , limited purchasing by both consumers and businesses . Even those Americans who continued to make a modest income during the Great Depression lost the drive for conspicuous consumption that they exhibited in the 1920s . People with less money to buy goods could not help businesses grow ; in turn , businesses with no market for their products could not hire workers or purchase raw materials . Employers began to lay off workers . The country ’ s gross national product declined by over 25 percent within a year , and wages and salaries declined by $ 4 billion . Unemployment tripled , from 1.5 million at the end of 1929 to 4.5 million by the end of 1930 .

0,"The crash of 1929 did not occur in a vacuum , nor did it cause the Great Depression . Rather , it was a tipping point where the underlying weaknesses in the economy , specifically in the nation ’ s banking system , came to the fore . It also represented both the end of an era characterized by blind faith in American exceptionalism and the beginning of one in which citizens began increasingly to question some long-held American values . A number of factors played a role in bringing the stock market to this point and contributed to the downward trend in the market , which continued well into the 1930s . In addition to the Federal Reserve ’ s questionable policies and misguided banking practices , three primary reasons for the collapse of the stock market were international economic woes , poor income distribution , and the psychology of public confidence .",0.10693489760160446,0.0

0,"The contagion effect of the crash grew quickly . With investors losing billions of dollars , they invested very little in new or expanded businesses . At this time , two industries had the greatest impact on the country ’ s economic future in terms of investment , potential growth , and employment : automotive and construction . After the crash , both were hit hard . In November 1929 , fewer cars were built than in any other month since November 1919 . Even before the crash , widespread saturation of the market meant that few Americans bought them , leading to a slowdown . Afterward , very few could afford luxury cars , like Stutz , Deusenberg , and Pierce-Arrow , so these car companies gradually went out of business in the 1930s . In construction , the drop-off was even more dramatic . It would be another thirty years before a new hotel or theater was built in New York City . The Empire State Building itself stood half empty for years after being completed in 1931 .",0.1624859869480133,0.0
0,"The Florida land boom went bust in 1925 – 1926 . A combination of negative press about the speculative nature of the boom , IRS investigations into the questionable financial practices of several land brokers , and a railroad embargo that limited the delivery of construction supplies into the region significantly hampered investor interest . The subsequent Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 drove most land developers into outright bankruptcy . However , speculation continued throughout the decade , this time in the stock market . Buyers purchased stock “ on margin ” — buying for a small down payment with borrowed money , with the intention of quickly selling at a much higher price before the remaining payment came due — which worked well as long as prices continued to rise . Speculators were aided by retail stock brokerage firms , which catered to average investors anxious to play the market but lacking direct ties to investment banking houses or larger brokerage firms . When prices began to fluctuate in the summer of 1929 , investors sought excuses to continue their speculation . When fluctuations turned to outright and steady losses , everyone started to sell . As September began to unfold , the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at a value of 381 points , or roughly ten times the stock market ’ s value , at the start of the 1920s .",0.931063175201416,1.0

0,"Several warning signs portended the impending crash but went unheeded by Americans still giddy over the potential fortunes that speculation might promise . A brief downturn in the market on September 18 , 1929 , raised questions among more-seasoned investment bankers , leading some to predict an end to high stock values , but did little to stem the tide of investment . Even the collapse of the London Stock Exchange on September 20 failed to fully curtail the optimism of American investors . However , when the New York Stock Exchange lost 11 percent of its value on October 24 — often referred to as “ Black Thursday ” — key American investors sat up and took notice . In an effort to forestall a much-feared panic , leading banks , including Chase National , National City , J . P . Morgan , and others , conspired to purchase large amounts of blue chip stocks ( including U . S . Steel ) in order to keep the prices artificially high . Even that effort failed in the growing wave of stock sales . Nevertheless , Hoover delivered a radio address on Friday in which he assured the American people , “ The fundamental business of the country . . . is on a sound and prosperous basis . ” As newspapers across the country began to cover the story in earnest , investors anxiously awaited the start of the following week . When the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost another 13 percent of its value on Monday morning , many knew the end of stock market speculation was near . The evening before the infamous crash was ominous . Jonathan Leonard , a newspaper reporter who regularly covered the stock market beat , wrote of how Wall Street “ lit up like a Christmas tree . ” Brokers and businessmen who feared the worst the next day crowded into restaurants and speakeasies ( a place where alcoholic beverages were illegally sold ) . After a night of heavy drinking , they retreated to nearby hotels or flop-houses ( cheap boarding houses ) , all of which were overbooked , and awaited sunrise . Children from nearby slums and tenement districts played stickball in the streets of the financial district , using wads of ticker tape for balls . Although they all awoke to newspapers filled with predictions of a financial turnaround , as well as technical reasons why the decline might be short-lived , the crash on Tuesday morning , October 29 , caught few by surprise .",0.052567798644304276,0.0

The steps he took were very much in keeping with his philosophy of limited government , a philosophy that many had shared with him until the upheavals of the Great Depression made it clear that a more direct government response was required . But Hoover was stubborn in his refusal to give “ handouts , ” as he saw direct government aid . He called for a spirit of volunteerism among America ’ s businesses , asking them to keep workers employed , and he exhorted the American people to tighten their belts and make do in the spirit of “ rugged individualism . ” While Hoover ’ s philosophy and his appeal to the country were very much in keeping with his character , it was not enough to keep the economy from plummeting further into economic chaos .",0.05504710227251053,0.0

This scenario meant that there were no new buyers coming into the marketplace , and nowhere for sellers to unload their stock as the speculation came to a close . In addition , the vast majority of Americans with limited savings lost their accounts as local banks closed , and likewise lost their jobs as investment in business and industry came to a screeching halt .",0.06418147683143616,0.0

0,"One such incident was the case of the Scottsboro Boys ( Figure 25.12 ) . In 1931 , nine Black boys , who had been riding the rails , were arrested for vagrancy and disorderly conduct after an altercation with some White travelers on the train . Two young White women , who had been dressed as boys and traveling with a group of White boys , came forward and said that the Black boys had raped them . The case , which was tried in Scottsboro , Alabama , illuminated decades of racial hatred and illustrated the injustice of the court system . Despite significant evidence that the women had not been raped at all , along with one of the women subsequently recanting her testimony , the all-White jury quickly convicted the boys and sentenced all but one of them to death . The verdict broke through the veil of indifference toward the plight of African Americans , and protests erupted among newspaper editors , academics , and social reformers in the North . The Communist Party of the United States offered to handle the case and sought retrial ; the NAACP later joined in this effort . In all , the case was tried three separate times . The series of trials and retrials , appeals , and overturned convictions shone a spotlight on a system that provided poor legal counsel and relied on all-White juries . In October 1932 , the U . S . Supreme Court agreed with the Communist Party ’ s defense attorneys that the defendants had been denied adequate legal representation at the original trial , and that due process as provided by the Fourteenth Amendment had been denied as a result of the exclusion of any potential Black jurors . Eventually , most of the accused received lengthy prison terms and subsequent parole , but avoided the death penalty .

To put this number in perspective , geologists estimate that it takes the earth five hundred years to naturally regenerate one inch of topsoil ; yet , just one significant dust storm could destroy a similar amount . In their desperation to get more from the land , farmers had stripped it of the delicate balance that kept it healthy .

0,"Life for all rural Americans was difficult . Farmers largely did not experience the widespread prosperity of the 1920s . Although continued advancements in farming techniques and agricultural machinery led to increased agricultural production , decreasing demand ( particularly in the previous markets created by World War I ) steadily drove down commodity prices . As a result , farmers could barely pay the debt they owed on machinery and land mortgages , and even then could do so only as a result of generous lines of credit from banks . While factory workers may have lost their jobs and savings in the crash , many farmers also lost their homes , due to the thousands of farm foreclosures sought by desperate bankers . Between 1930 and 1935 , nearly 750,000 family farms disappeared through foreclosure or bankruptcy . Even for those who managed to keep their farms , there was little market for their crops . Unemployed workers had less money to spend on food , and when they did purchase goods , the market excess had driven prices so low that farmers could barely piece together a living . A now-famous example of the farmer ’ s plight is that , when the price of coal began to exceed that of corn , farmers would simply burn corn to stay warm in the winter .",0.04160713776946068,0.0

Yet Hoover was neither intentionally blind nor unsympathetic . He simply held fast to a belief system that did not change as the realities of the Great Depression set in .",0.09494209289550781,0.0
0,"In the decades before the Great Depression , and particularly in the 1920s , American culture largely reflected the values of individualism , self-reliance , and material success through competition . Novels like F . Scott Fitzgerald ’ s The Great Gatsby and Sinclair Lewis ’ s Babbit portrayed wealth and the self-made man in America , albeit in a critical fashion . In film , many silent movies , such as Charlie Chaplin ’ s The Gold Rush , depicted the rags-to-riches fable that Americans so loved . With the shift in U . S . fortunes , however , came a shift in values , and with it , a new cultural reflection . The arts revealed a new emphasis on the welfare of the whole and the importance of community in preserving family life . While box office sales briefly declined at the beginning of the Depression , they quickly rebounded . Movies offered a way for Americans to think of better times , and people were willing to pay twenty-five cents for a chance to escape , at least for a few hours .",0.443852037191391,0.0

This advertisement for California real estate illustrates how realtors in the West , much like the ongoing Florida land boom , used a combination of the hard sell and easy credit ( Figure 25.3 ) . “ Buy now ! ! ” the ad shouts . “ You are sure to make money on these . ” In great numbers , people did . With easy access to credit and hard-pushing advertisements like this one , many felt that they could not afford to miss out on such an opportunity . Unfortunately , overspeculation in California and hurricanes along the Gulf Coast and in Florida conspired to burst this land bubble , and would-be millionaires were left with nothing but the ads that once pulled them in .",0.026558762416243553,0.0
0,"In keeping with these principles , Hoover ’ s response to the crash focused on two very common American traditions : He asked individuals to tighten their belts and work harder , and he asked the business community to voluntarily help sustain the economy by retaining workers and continuing production . He immediately summoned a conference of leading industrialists to meet in Washington , DC , urging them to maintain their current wages while America rode out this brief economic panic . The crash , he assured business leaders , was not part of a greater downturn ; they had nothing to worry about . Similar meetings with utility companies and railroad executives elicited promises for billions of dollars in new construction projects , while labor leaders agreed to withhold demands for wage increases and workers continued to labor . Hoover also persuaded Congress to pass a $ 160 million tax cut to bolster American incomes , leading many to conclude that the president was doing all he could to stem the tide of the panic . In April 1930 , the New York Times editorial board concluded that “ No one in his place could have done more . ” However , these modest steps were not enough . By late 1931 , when it became clear that the economy would not improve on its own , Hoover recognized the need for some government intervention . He created the President ’ s Emergency Committee for Employment ( PECE ) , later renamed the President ’ s Organization of Unemployment Relief ( POUR ) . In keeping with Hoover ’ s distaste of what he viewed as handouts , this organization did not provide direct federal relief to people in need . Instead , it assisted state and private relief agencies , such as the Red Cross , Salvation Army , YMCA , and Community Chest . Hoover also strongly urged people of means to donate funds to help the poor , and he himself gave significant private donations to worthy causes . But these private efforts could not alleviate the widespread effects of poverty . Congress pushed for a more direct government response to the hardship . In 1930 – 1931 , it attempted to pass a $ 60 million bill to provide relief to drought victims by allowing them access to food , fertilizer , and animal feed . Hoover stood fast in his refusal to provide food , resisting any element of direct relief . The final bill of $ 47 million provided for everything except food but did not come close to adequately addressing the crisis . Again in 1931 , Congress proposed the Federal Emergency Relief Bill , which would have provided $ 375 million to states to help provide food , clothing , and shelter to the homeless . But Hoover opposed the bill , stating that it ruined the balance of power between states and the federal government , and in February 1932 , it was defeated by fourteen votes . However , the president ’ s adamant opposition to direct-relief federal government programs should not be viewed as one of indifference or uncaring toward the suffering American people . His personal sympathy for those in need was boundless . Hoover was one of only two presidents to reject his salary for the office he held . Throughout the Great Depression , he donated an average of $ 25,000 annually to various relief organizations to assist in their efforts . Furthermore , he helped to raise $ 500,000 in private funds to support the White House Conference on Child Health and Welfare in 1930 . Rather than indifference or heartlessness , Hoover ’ s steadfast adherence to a philosophy of individualism as the path toward long-term American recovery explained many of his policy decisions . “ A voluntary deed , ” he repeatedly commented , “ is infinitely more precious to our national ideal and spirit than a thousand-fold poured from the Treasury . ”",0.986662745475769,1.0

Even jobs traditionally held by Black workers , such as household servants or janitors , were now going to Whites . By 1932 , approximately one-half of all Black Americans were unemployed . Racial violence also began to rise . In the South , lynching became more common again , with twenty-eight documented lynchings in 1933 , compared to eight in 1932 . Since communities were preoccupied with their own hardships , and organizing civil rights efforts was a long , difficult process , many resigned themselves to , or even ignored , this culture of racism and violence .

0,"However , Hoover the president was a product of his time . Americans sought a president in 1928 who would continue the policies of normalcy with which many associated the prosperity they enjoyed . They wanted a president who would forego government interference and allow industrial capitalism to grow unfettered . Hoover , from his days as the secretary of commerce , was the ideal candidate . In fact , he was too ideal when the Great Depression actually hit . Holding steadfast to his philosophy of “ American individualism , ” Hoover proved largely incapable of shifting into economic crisis mode when Americans came to realize that prosperity could not last forever . Desperate to help , but unwilling to compromise on his philosophy , Hoover could not manage a comprehensive solution to the worldwide depression that few foresaw . Only when reelection was less than a year away did a reluctant Hoover initiate significant policies , but even then , they did not provide direct relief . By the start of 1932 , unemployment hovered near 25 percent , and thousands of banks and factories were closing their doors . Combined with Hoover ’ s ill-timed response to the Bonus Army crisis , his political fate was sealed . Americans would look to the next president for a solution . “ Democracy is a harsh employer , ” Hoover concluded , as he awaited all but certain defeat in the November election of 1932 ( Figure 25.17 ) .",0.6734734177589417,0.0
0,"Hoover ’ s steadfast resistance to government aid cost him the reelection and has placed him squarely at the forefront of the most unpopular presidents , according to public opinion , in modern American history . His name became synonymous with the poverty of the era : “ Hoovervilles ” became the common name for homeless shantytowns ( Figure 25.9 ) and “ Hoover blankets ” for the newspapers that the homeless used to keep warm . A “ Hoover flag ” was a pants pocket — empty of all money — turned inside out . By the 1932 election , hitchhikers held up signs reading : “ If you don ’ t give me a ride , I ’ ll vote for Hoover . ” Americans did not necessarily believe that Hoover caused the Great Depression . Their anger stemmed instead from what appeared to be a willful refusal to help regular citizens with direct aid that might allow them to recover from the crisis .",0.9766184687614441,0.0

This act authorized the RFC to expand beyond loans to financial institutions and allotted $ 1.5 billion to states to fund local public works projects . This program failed to deliver the kind of help needed , however , as Hoover severely limited the types of projects it could fund to those that were ultimately self-paying ( such as toll bridges and public housing ) and those that required skilled workers . While well intended , these programs maintained the status quo , and there was still no direct federal relief to the individuals who so desperately needed it .",1.0218443870544434,0.0

In response to the Teapot Dome Affair , which had occurred during the Harding administration , he invalidated several private oil leases on public lands . He directed the Department of Justice , through its Bureau of Investigation , to crack down on organized crime , resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of Al Capone . By the summer of 1929 , he had signed into law the creation of a Federal Farm Board to help farmers with government price supports , expanded tax cuts across all income classes , and set aside federal funds to clean up slums in major American cities . To directly assist several overlooked populations , he created the Veterans Administration and expanded veterans ’ hospitals , established the Federal Bureau of Prisons to oversee incarceration conditions nationwide , and reorganized the Bureau of Indian Affairs to further protect Native Americans . Just prior to the stock market crash , he even proposed the creation of an old-age pension program , promising fifty dollars monthly to all Americans over the age of sixty-five — a proposal remarkably similar to the social security benefit that would become a hallmark of Roosevelt ’ s subsequent New Deal programs .

Hoover subsequently appointed Charles Rhoads as the new commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and advocated , with Rhoads ’ assistance , for Native American self-sufficiency and full assimilation as Americans under the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 .

0,"Hoover believed strongly in the ethos of American individualism : that hard work brought its own rewards . His life story testified to that belief . Hoover was born into poverty , made his way through college at Stanford University , and eventually made his fortune as an engineer . This experience , as well as his extensive travels in China and throughout Europe , shaped his fundamental conviction that the very existence of American civilization depended upon the moral fiber of its citizens , as evidenced by their ability to overcome all hardships through individual effort and resolve . The idea of government handouts to Americans was repellant to him . Whereas Europeans might need assistance , such as his hunger relief work in Belgium during and after World War I , he believed the American character to be different . In a 1931 radio address , he said , “ The spread of government destroys initiative and thus destroys character . ” Likewise , Hoover was not completely unaware of the potential harm that wild stock speculation might create if left unchecked . As secretary of commerce , Hoover often warned President Coolidge of the dangers that such speculation engendered . In the weeks before his inauguration , he offered many interviews to newspapers and magazines , urging Americans to curtail their rampant stock investments , and even encouraged the Federal Reserve to raise the discount rate to make it more costly for local banks to lend money to potential speculators . However , fearful of creating a panic , Hoover never issued a stern warning to discourage Americans from such investments . Neither Hoover , nor any other politician of that day , ever gave serious thought to outright government regulation of the stock market . This was even true in his personal choices , as Hoover often lamented poor stock advice he had once offered to a friend .

While it is misleading to view the stock market crash of 1929 as the sole cause of the Great Depression , the dramatic events of that October did play a role in the downward spiral of the American economy . The crash , which took place less than a year after Hoover was inaugurated , was the most extreme sign of the economy ’ s weakness . Multiple factors contributed to the crash , which in turn caused a consumer panic that drove the economy even further downhill , in ways that neither Hoover nor the financial industry was able to restrain . Hoover , like many others at the time , thought and hoped that the country would right itself with limited government intervention .

As the federal government continued to purchase all excess produce for the war effort , farmers and ranchers fell into several bad practices , including mortgaging their farms and borrowing money against future production in order to expand . However , after the war , prosperity rapidly dwindled , particularly during the recession of 1921 . Seeking to recoup their losses through economies of scale in which they would expand their production even further to take full advantage of their available land and machinery , farmers plowed under native grasses to plant acre after acre of wheat , with little regard for the long-term repercussions to the soil . Regardless of these misguided efforts , commodity prices continued to drop , finally plummeting in 1929 , when the price of wheat dropped from two dollars to forty cents per bushel .",0.3715648055076599,0.0

In the immediate aftermath , there was a run on the banks , where citizens took their money out , if they could get it , and hid their savings under mattresses , in bookshelves , or anywhere else they felt was safe . Some went so far as to exchange their dollars for gold and ship it out of the country . A number of banks failed outright , and others , in their attempts to stay solvent , called in loans that people could not afford to repay . Working-class Americans saw their wages drop : Even Henry Ford , the champion of a high minimum wage , began lowering wages by as much as a dollar a day . Southern cotton planters paid workers only twenty cents for every one hundred pounds of cotton picked , meaning that the strongest picker might earn sixty cents for a fourteen-hour day of work . Cities struggled to collect property taxes and subsequently laid off teachers and police . The new hardships that people faced were not always immediately apparent ; many communities felt the changes but could not necessarily look out their windows and see anything different . Men who lost their jobs didn ’ t stand on street corners begging ; they disappeared . They might be found keeping warm by a trashcan bonfire or picking through garbage at dawn , but mostly , they stayed out of public view . As the effects of the crash continued , however , the results became more evident . Those living in cities grew accustomed to seeing long breadlines of unemployed men waiting for a meal ( Figure 25.6 ) . Companies fired workers and tore down employee housing to avoid paying property taxes . The landscape of the country had changed .",0.026703951880335808,0.0
0,"For farmers who survived the initial crash , the situation worsened , particularly in the Great Plains where years of overproduction and rapidly declining commodity prices took their toll . Prices continued to decline , and as farmers tried to stay afloat , they produced still more crops , which drove prices even lower . Farms failed at an astounding rate , and farmers sold out at rock-bottom prices . One farm in Shelby , Nebraska was mortgaged at $ 4,100 and sold for $ 49.50 . One-fourth of the entire state of Mississippi was auctioned off in a single day at a foreclosure auction in April 1932 . Not all farmers tried to keep their land . Many , especially those who had arrived only recently , in an attempt to capitalize on the earlier prosperity , simply walked away ( Figure 25.14 ) . In hard-hit Oklahoma , thousands of farmers packed up what they could and walked or drove away from the land they thought would be their future . They , along with other displaced farmers from throughout the Great Plains , became known as Okies . Okies were an emblem of the failure of the American breadbasket to deliver on its promise , and their story was made famous in John Steinbeck ’ s novel , The Grapes of Wrath .",0.1979166716337204,0.0
0,"For farmers , the results were catastrophic . Unlike most factory workers in the cities , in most cases , farmers lost their homes when they lost their livelihood . Most farms and ranches were originally mortgaged to small country banks that understood the dynamics of farming , but as these banks failed , they often sold rural mortgages to larger eastern banks that were less concerned with the specifics of farm life . With the effects of the drought and low commodity prices , farmers could not pay their local banks , which in turn lacked funds to pay the large urban banks . Ultimately , the large banks foreclosed on the farms , often swallowing up the small country banks in the process . It is worth noting that of the five thousand banks that closed between 1930 and 1932 , over 75 percent were country banks in locations with populations under 2,500 . Given this dynamic , it is easy to see why farmers in the Great Plains remained wary of big city bankers .",0.9372013807296753,0.0

People wanted to forget their worries and enjoy the madcap antics of the Marx Brothers , the youthful charm of Shirley Temple , the dazzling dances of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ( Figure 25.15 ) , or the comforting morals of the Andy Hardy series . The Hardy series — nine films in all , produced by MGM from 1936 to 1940 — starred Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney , and all followed the adventures of a small-town judge and his son .

For much of the 1920s , the public felt confident that prosperity would continue forever , and therefore , in a self-fulfilling cycle , the market continued to grow . But once the panic began , it spread quickly and with the same cyclical results ; people were worried that the market was going down , they sold their stock , and the market continued to drop .

Led by Milo Reno , this organization held significant sway among farmers in Iowa , Nebraska , Wisconsin , Minnesota , and the Dakotas . Although they never comprised a majority of farmers in any of these states , their public actions drew press attention nationwide . Among their demands , the association sought a federal government plan to set agricultural prices artificially high enough to cover the farmers ’ costs , as well as a government commitment to sell any farm surpluses on the world market . To achieve their goals , the group called for farm holidays , during which farmers would neither sell their produce nor purchase any other goods until the government met their demands . However , the greatest strength of the association came from the unexpected and seldom-planned actions of its members , which included barricading roads into markets , attacking nonmember farmers , and destroying their produce . Some members even raided small town stores , destroying produce on the shelves . Members also engaged in “ penny auctions , ” bidding pennies on foreclosed farm land and threatening any potential buyers with bodily harm if they competed in the sale . Once they won the auction , the association returned the land to the original owner . In Iowa , farmers threatened to hang a local judge if he signed any more farm foreclosures . At least one death occurred as a direct result of these protests before they waned following the election of Franklin Roosevelt .",0.9956031441688538,0.0

Then , the few who had insurance would cash out their policies . Cash surrender payments of individual insurance policies tripled in the first three years of the Great Depression , with insurance companies issuing total payments in excess of $ 1.2 billion in 1932 alone . When those funds were depleted , people would borrow from family and friends , and when they could get no more , they would simply stop paying rent or mortgage payments . When evicted , they would move in with relatives , whose own situation was likely only a step or two behind . The added burden of additional people would speed along that family ’ s demise , and the cycle would continue . This situation spiraled downward , and did so quickly . Even as late as 1939 , over 60 percent of rural households , and 82 percent of farm families , were classified as “ impoverished . ” In larger urban areas , unemployment levels exceeded the national average , with over half a million unemployed workers in Chicago , and nearly a million in New York City .

A family with little food would stay in bed to save fuel and avoid burning calories . People began eating parts of animals that had normally been considered waste . They scavenged for scrap wood to burn in the furnace , and when electricity was turned off , it was not uncommon to try and tap into a neighbor ’ s wire .

The American Red Cross did exist , but Chairman John Barton Payne contended that unemployment was not an “ Act of God ” but rather an “ Act of Man , ” and therefore refused to get involved in widespread direct relief efforts . Clubs like the Elks tried to provide food , as did small groups of individually organized college students . Religious organizations remained on the front lines , offering food and shelter .

0,"As the effects of the Great Depression worsened , wealthier Americans had particular concern for “ the deserving poor ” — those who had lost all of their money due to no fault of their own . This concept gained greater attention beginning in the Progressive Era of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , when early social reformers sought to improve the quality of life for all Americans by addressing the poverty that was becoming more prevalent , particularly in emerging urban areas . By the time of the Great Depression , social reformers and humanitarian agencies had determined that the “ deserving poor ” belonged to a different category from those who had speculated and lost . However , the sheer volume of Americans who fell into this group meant that charitable assistance could not begin to reach them all . Some fifteen million “ deserving poor , ” or a full one-third of the labor force , were struggling by 1932 . The country had no mechanism or system in place to help so many ; however , Hoover remained adamant that such relief should rest in the hands of private agencies , not with the federal government ( Figure 25.7 ) .",0.9744935035705566,1.0
0,"As so much of the Hoover presidency is circumscribed by the onset of the Great Depression , one must be careful in assessing his successes and failures , so as not to attribute all blame to Hoover . Given the suffering that many Americans endured between the fall of 1929 and Franklin Roosevelt ’ s inauguration in the spring of 1933 , it is easy to lay much of the blame at Hoover ’ s doorstep ( Figure 25.16 ) . However , the extent to which Hoover was constrained by the economic circumstances unfolding well before he assumed office offers a few mitigating factors . Put simply , Hoover did not cause the stock market crash . However , his stubborn adherence to a questionable belief in “ American individualism , ” despite mounting evidence that people were starving , requires that some blame be attributed to his policies ( or lack thereof ) for the depth and length of the Depression . Yet , Hoover ’ s presidency was much more than simply combating the Depression . To assess the extent of his inability to provide meaningful national leadership through the darkest months of the Depression , his other policies require consideration .",0.09772180020809174,1.0
0,"As conditions worsened , however , Hoover eventually relaxed his opposition to federal relief and formed the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC ) in 1932 , in part because it was an election year and Hoover hoped to keep his office . Although not a form of direct relief to the American people in greatest need , the RFC was much larger in scope than any preceding effort , setting aside $ 2 billion in taxpayer money to rescue banks , credit unions , and insurance companies . The goal was to boost confidence in the nation ’ s financial institutions by ensuring that they were on solid footing . This model was flawed on a number of levels . First , the program only lent money to banks with sufficient collateral , which meant that most of the aid went to large banks . In fact , of the first $ 61 million loaned , $ 41 million went to just three banks . Small town and rural banks got almost nothing . Furthermore , at this time , confidence in financial institutions was not the primary concern of most Americans . They needed food and jobs . Many had no money to put into the banks , no matter how confident they were that the banks were safe .",1.0040425062179565,0.0

Smith Goes to Washington was emblematic of his work . In this 1939 film , Jimmy Stewart plays a legislator sent to Washington to finish out the term of a deceased senator . While there , he fights corruption to ensure the construction of a boy ’ s camp in his hometown rather than a dam project that would only serve to line the pockets of a few . He ultimately engages in a two-day filibuster , standing up to the power players to do what ’ s right . The Depression era was a favorite of Capra ’ s to depict in his films , including It ’ s a Wonderful Life , released in 1946 .

0,"Although it was a relatively quiet period for U . S . diplomacy , Hoover did help to usher in a period of positive relations , specifically with several Latin American neighbors . This would establish the basis for Franklin Roosevelt ’ s “ Good Neighbor ” policy . After a goodwill tour of Central American countries immediately following his election in 1928 , Hoover shaped the subsequent Clark Memorandum — released in 1930 — which largely repudiated the previous Roosevelt Corollary , establishing a basis for unlimited American military intervention throughout Latin America . To the contrary , through the memorandum , Hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older Monroe Doctrine , in which the U . S . pledged assistance to her Latin American neighbors should any European powers interfere in Western Hemisphere affairs . Hoover further strengthened relations to the south by withdrawing American troops from Haiti and Nicaragua . Additionally , he outlined with Secretary of State Henry Stimson the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine , which announced that the United States would never recognize claims to territories seized by force ( a direct response to the recent Japanese invasion of Manchuria ) . Other diplomatic overtures met with less success for Hoover . Most notably , in an effort to support the American economy during the early stages of the Depression , the president signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930 . The law , which raised tariffs on thousands of imports , was intended to increase sales of American-made goods , but predictably angered foreign trade partners who in turn raised their tariffs on American imports , thus shrinking international trade and closing additional markets to desperate American manufacturers . As a result , the global depression worsened further . A similar attempt to spur the world economy , known as the Hoover Moratorium , likewise met with great opposition and little economic benefit . Issued in 1931 , the moratorium called for a halt to World War I reparations to be paid by Germany to France , as well as forgiveness of Allied war debts to the U . S .",0.9966303706169128,1.0

At the same time , however , they reflected an increased interest in sex and sexuality . While the birth rate was dropping , surveys in Fortune magazine in 1936 – 1937 found that two-thirds of college students favored birth control , and that 50 percent of men and 25 percent of women admitted to premarital sex , continuing a trend among younger Americans that had begun to emerge in the 1920s . Contraceptive sales soared during the decade , and again , culture reflected this shift . Blonde bombshell Mae West was famous for her sexual innuendoes , and her flirtatious persona was hugely popular , although it got her banned on radio broadcasts throughout the Midwest . Whether West or Garland , Chaplin or Stewart , American film continued to be a barometer of American values , and their challenges , through the decade . 25.4 Assessing the Hoover Years on the Eve of the New Deal Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.05914579704403877,0.0

The U . S . Department of Labor predicted that 1930 would be “ a splendid employment year . ” These sentiments were not as baseless as it may seem in hindsight . Historically , markets cycled up and down , and periods of growth were often followed by downturns that corrected themselves . But this time , there was no market correction ; rather , the abrupt shock of the crash was followed by an even more devastating depression . Investors , along with the general public , withdrew their money from banks by the thousands , fearing the banks would go under .

The economies of those countries , however , were struggling badly , and they could not pay their reparations , despite the loans that the U . S . provided to assist with their payments . The U .

Indeed , conservative Whigs defined themselves in opposition to democracy , which they equated with anarchy . In the tenth in a series of essays later known as The Federalist Papers , Virginian James Madison wrote : “ Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention ; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property ; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths . ” Many shared this perspective and worked hard to keep democratic tendencies in check .

Supporters of the 1787 Constitution , known as Federalists , made the case that a centralized republic provided the best solution for the future . Those who opposed it , known as Anti-Federalists , argued that the Constitution would consolidate all power in a national government , robbing the states of the power to make their own decisions . To them , the Constitution appeared to mimic the old corrupt and centralized British regime , under which a far-off government made the laws . Anti-Federalists argued that wealthy aristocrats would run the new national government , and that the elite would not represent ordinary citizens ; the rich would monopolize power and use the new government to formulate policies that benefited their class — a development that would also undermine local state elites .

Significantly , no direct federal income tax was immediately imposed . ( The Sixteenth Amendment , ratified in 1913 , put in place a federal income tax . ) Northerners agreed to the three-fifths compromise because the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 , passed by the Confederation Congress , banned slavery in the future states of the northwest .

1,"By the time of the Revolution , slavery had been firmly in place in America for over one hundred years . In many ways , the Revolution served to reinforce the assumptions about race among White Americans . They viewed the new nation as a White republic ; Black people were enslaved , and Native Americans had no place . Racial hatred of Black people increased during the Revolution because many enslaved people fled their enslavers for the freedom offered by the British . The same was true for Native Americans who allied themselves with the British ; Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence that separation from the Empire was necessary because George III had incited “ the merciless Indian savages ” to destroy the White inhabitants on the frontier . Similarly , Thomas Paine argued in Common Sense that Great Britain was guilty of inciting “ the Indians and Negroes to destroy us . ” For his part , Benjamin Franklin wrote in the 1780s that , in time , alcoholism would wipe out the Natives , leaving the land free for White settlers .",0.41857728362083435,0.0

Revolutionary leaders agreed that the ownership of property provided one way to measure an individual ’ s virtue , arguing that property holders had the greatest stake in society and therefore could be trusted to make decisions for it . By the same token , non-property holders , they believed , should have very little to do with government . In other words , unlike a democracy , in which the mass of non-property holders could exercise the political right to vote , a republic would limit political rights to property holders .

2,"We can see an example of institutionalized sexism in the way that women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with certain kinds of mental disorders . Psychologist Dana Becker notes that 75 percent of all diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD ) are for women according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . This diagnosis is characterized by instability of identity , of mood , and of behavior , and Becker argues that it has been used as a catch-all diagnosis for too many women . She further decries the pejorative connotation of the diagnosis , saying that it predisposes many people , both within and outside of the profession of psychotherapy , against women who have been so diagnosed ( Becker ) . Many critics also point to the medicalization of women ’ s issues as an example of institutionalized sexism . Medicalization refers to the process by which previously normal aspects of life are redefined as deviant and needing medical attention to remedy . Historically and contemporaneously , many aspects of women ’ s lives have been medicalized , including menstruation , pre-menstrual syndrome , pregnancy , childbirth , and menopause . The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth has been particularly contentious in recent decades , with many women opting against the medical process and choosing a more natural childbirth . Fox and Worts ( 1999 ) find that all women experience pain and anxiety during the birth process , but that social support relieves both as effectively as medical support . In other words , medical interventions are no more effective than social ones at helping with the difficulties of pain and childbirth . Fox and Worts further found that women with supportive partners ended up with less medical intervention and fewer cases of postpartum depression . Of course , access to quality birth care outside of the standard medical models may not be readily available to women of all social classes .",0.20711013674736023,1.0

However , some people question if , or how much , all these products really help in the fight against breast cancer ( Begos 2011 ) . The advocacy group Breast Cancer Action ( BCA ) position themselves as watchdogs of other agencies fighting breast cancer . They accept no funding from entities , like those in the pharmaceutical industry , with potential profit connections to this health industry . They ’ ve developed a trademarked “ Think Before You Pink ” campaign to provoke consumer questioning of the end contributions made to breast cancer by companies hawking pink wares . They do not advise against “ pink ” purchases ; they just want consumers to be informed about how much money is involved , where it comes from , and where it will go . For instance , what percentage of each purchase goes to breast cancer causes ?

These concerns range from fears about overloading the child ’ s immune system to controversial reports about devastating side effects of the vaccines . One misapprehension is that the vaccine itself might cause the disease it is supposed to be immunizing against . Another commonly circulated concern is that vaccinations , specifically the MMR vaccine ( MMR stands for measles , mumps , and rubella ) , are linked to autism . The autism connection has been particularly controversial . In 1998 , a British physician named Andrew Wakefield published a study in Great Britain ’ s Lancet magazine that linked the MMR vaccine to autism . The report received a lot of media attention , resulting in British immunization rates decreasing from 91 percent in 1997 to almost 80 percent by 2003 , accompanied by a subsequent rise in measles cases ( Devlin 2008 ) .

Of course , no one gives voice to these kinds of views in public now , except when talking about obese people . Why is it considered acceptable to feel prejudice toward — even to hate — obese people ? Puhl and Heuer suggest that these feelings stem from the perception that obesity is preventable through self-control , better diet , and more exercise .

2,"Another fairly commonly diagnosed mental disorder is Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , which statistics suggest affects nine percent of children and eight percent of adults on a lifetime basis ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) . ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders , and it is marked by difficulty paying attention , difficulty controlling behavior , and hyperactivity . According to the American Psychological Association ( APA ) , ADHD responds positively to stimulant drugs like Ritalin , which helps people stay focused . However , there is some social debate over whether such drugs are being overprescribed ( American Psychological Association ) . In fact , some critics question whether this disorder is really as widespread as it seems , or if it is a case of overdiagnosis . Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) have gained a lot of attention in recent years . The term ASD encompasses a group of developmental brain disorders that are characterized by “ deficits in social interaction , verbal and nonverbal communication , and engagement in repetitive behaviors or interests ” ( National Institute of Mental Health ) . As with the personality disorders described above , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders ’ description of these is in the process of being revised . The National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) distinguishes between serious mental illness and other disorders . The key feature of serious mental illness is that it results in “ serious functional impairment , which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities ” ( National Institute of Mental Health ) . Thus , the characterization of “ serious ” refers to the effect of the illness ( functional impairment ) , not the illness itself . Although the view is not widely held , there are some researchers who argue that mental illness is a myth . For example , to Thomas Scheff ( 1963 ) , residual deviance — a violation of social norms not covered by any specific behavioral expectation — is what actually results in people being labeled mentally ill . In The Myth of Mental Illness : Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct ( 1961 ) , Thomas Szasz asks if there is such a thing as mental illness , and then argues that there is not . Rather , mental illness is a deviation from what others view as normal , with no basis in biological disease . Szasz calls for greater personal responsibility and less reliance on institutions .",0.9960120916366577,0.0
2,"An example of medicalization is illustrated by the history of how our society views alcohol and alcoholism . During the 19th century , people who drank too much were considered bad , lazy people . They were called drunks , and it was not uncommon for them to be arrested or run out of a town . Drunks were not treated in a sympathetic way because , at that time , it was thought that it was their own fault that they could not stop drinking . During the latter half of the 20th century , however , people who drank too much were increasingly defined as alcoholics : people with a disease or a genetic predisposition to addiction who were not responsible for their drinking . With alcoholism defined as a disease and not a personal choice , alcoholics came to be viewed with more compassion and understanding .

Wealthy parents tend to have better educations and often work in managerial positions or in careers that require creative problem solving , so they teach their children behaviors that would be beneficial in these positions .

Without socialization , a society ’ s culture would perish as members died off . A conflict theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics . For example , individuals are socialized differently by gender , social class , and race . As in the illustration of Chris Langan , this creates different ( unequal ) opportunities .

As Danielle ’ s story illustrates , even the most basic of human activities are learned . You may be surprised to know that even physical tasks like sitting , standing , and walking had not automatically developed for Danielle as she grew .

3,"Moral development is an important part of the socialization process . The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a smoothly functioning society . Moral development prevents people from acting on unchecked urges , instead considering what is right for society and good for others . Lawrence Kohlberg ( 1927 – 1987 ) was interested in how people learn to decide what is right and what is wrong . To understand this topic , he developed a theory of moral development that includes three levels : preconventional , conventional , and postconventional . In the preconventional stage , young children , who lack a higher level of cognitive ability , experience the world around them only through their senses . It isn ’ t until the teen years that the conventional theory develops , when youngsters become increasingly aware of others ’ feelings and take those into consideration when determining what ’ s “ good ” and “ bad . ” The final stage , called postconventional , is when people begin to think of morality in abstract terms , such as Americans believing that everyone has the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . At this stage , people also recognize that legality and morality do not always match up evenly ( Kohlberg 1981 ) . When hundreds of thousands of Egyptians turned out in 2011 to protest government corruption , they were using postconventional morality . They understood that although their government was legal , it was not morally correct .",1.0131070613861084,1.0

3,"Later , George Herbert Mead ( 1863 – 1931 ) studied the self , a person ’ s distinct identity that is developed through social interaction . In order to engage in this process of “ self , ” an individual has to be able to view him or herself through the eyes of others . That ’ s not an ability that we are born with ( Mead 1934 ) . The case of Danielle , for example , illustrates what happens when social interaction is absent from early experience : she had no ability to see herself as others would see her . From Mead ’ s point of view , she had no “ self . ” How do we get from being newborns to being humans with “ selves ? ” Mead believed that there is a specific path of development that all people go through . During the preparatory stage , children are only capable of imitation : they have no ability to imagine how others see things . They copy the actions of people with whom they regularly interact , such as their mothers and fathers . This is followed by the play stage , during which children begin to take on the role that one other person might have . Thus , children might try on a parent ’ s point of view by acting out “ grownup ” behavior , like playing “ dress up ” and acting out the “ mom ” role , or talking on a toy telephone the way they see their father do .",0.9949181079864502,0.0

4,"What is Cognitive Dissonance ? Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteem is a powerful motivator of human behavior ( Tavris & Aronson , 2008 ) . In the United States , members of the predominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who are above average on many desirable traits ( Ehrlinger , Gilovich , & Ross , 2005 ) . Often , our behavior , attitudes , and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self-esteem or positive self-image . Psychologist Leon Festinger ( 1957 ) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes , behaviors , or cognitions ( thoughts , beliefs , or opinions ) . Festinger ’ s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self-perceptions , we experience psychological discomfort ( dissonance ) . For example , if you believe smoking is bad for your health but you continue to smoke , you experience conflict between your belief and behavior ( Figure 12.11 ) . Later research documented that only conflicting cognitions that threaten individuals ’ positive self-image cause dissonance ( Greenwald & Ronis , 1978 ) . Additional research found that dissonance is not only psychologically uncomfortable but also can cause physiological arousal ( Croyle & Cooper , 1983 ) and activate regions of the brain important in emotions and cognitive functioning ( van Veen , Krug , Schooler , & Carter , 2009 ) . When we experience cognitive dissonance , we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically , physically , and mentally uncomfortable . We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions , attitudes , and behaviors in line — that is , making them harmonious .

For example , there are decades of research that shows that you are more likely to become friends with people who live in your dorm , your apartment building , or your immediate neighborhood than with people who live farther away ( Festinger , Schachler , & Back , 1950 ) .

4,"Understanding Prejudice and Discrimination As we discussed in the opening story of Trayvon Martin , humans are very diverse and although we share many similarities , we also have many differences . The social groups we belong to help form our identities ( Tajfel , 1974 ) . These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile , which may lead to prejudice toward people who are different . Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on one ’ s membership in a particular social group ( Allport , 1954 ; Brown , 2010 ) . Prejudice is common against people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group . Thus , certain types of education , contact , interactions , and building relationships with members of different cultural groups can reduce the tendency toward prejudice . In fact , simply imagining interacting with members of different cultural groups might affect prejudice . Indeed , when experimental participants were asked to imagine themselves positively interacting with someone from a different group , this led to an increased positive attitude toward the other group and an increase in positive traits associated with the other group . Furthermore , imagined social interaction can reduce anxiety associated with inter-group interactions ( Crisp & Turner , 2009 ) . What are some examples of social groups that you belong to that contribute to your identity ? Social groups can include gender , race , ethnicity , nationality , social class , religion , sexual orientation , profession , and many more . And , as is true for social roles , you can simultaneously be a member of more than one social group . An example of prejudice is having a negative attitude toward people who are not born in the United States . Although people holding this prejudiced attitude do not know all people who were not born in the United States , they dislike them due to their status as foreigners .",0.9932929277420044,0.0

4,"There are many different theories as to why aggression exists . Some researchers argue that aggression serves an evolutionary function ( Buss , 2004 ) . Men are more likely than women to show aggression ( Wilson & Daly , 1985 ) . From the perspective of evolutionary psychology , human male aggression , like that in nonhuman primates , likely serves to display dominance over other males , both to protect a mate and to perpetuate the male ’ s genes ( Figure 12.25 ) . Sexual jealousy is part of male aggression ; males endeavor to make sure their mates are not copulating with other males , thus ensuring their own paternity of the female ’ s offspring . Although aggression provides an obvious evolutionary advantage for men , women also engage in aggression . Women typically display instrumental forms of aggression , with their aggression serving as a means to an end ( Dodge & Schwartz , 1997 ) . For example , women may express their aggression covertly , for example , by communication that impairs the social standing of another person . Another theory that explains one of the functions of human aggression is frustration aggression theory ( Dollard , Doob , Miller , Mowrer , & Sears , 1939 ) . This theory states that when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal , they become frustrated and aggressive .",1.0001988410949707,0.0

Out of this work came a model called the Yale attitude change approach , which describes the conditions under which people tend to change their attitudes .

Instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’ s quality , the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement . For example , having a popular athlete advertise athletic shoes is a common method used to encourage young adults to purchase the shoes . This route to attitude change does not require much effort or information processing . This method of persuasion may promote positivity toward the message or product , but it typically results in less permanent attitude or behavior change . The audience does not need to be analytical or motivated to process the message . In fact , a peripheral route to persuasion may not even be noticed by the audience , for example in the strategy of product placement . Product placement refers to putting a product with a clear brand name or brand identity in a TV show or movie to promote the product ( Gupta & Lord , 1998 ) . For example , one season of the reality series American Idol prominently showed the panel of judges drinking out of cups that displayed the Coca-Cola logo .

Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew the answers , and they presented these questions to the contestants . The contestants answered the questions correctly only 4 out of 10 times ( Figure 12.3 ) . After the task , the questioners and contestants were asked to rate their own general knowledge compared to the average student . Questioners did not rate their general knowledge higher than the contestants , but the contestants rated the questioners ’ intelligence higher than their own . In a second study , observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more general knowledge than the contestant . The obvious influence on performance is the situation .

4,"The finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the reason government elections require voting in secret , so we are not coerced by others ( Figure 12.18 ) . The Asch effect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something . For example , if the teacher asks whether the children would rather have extra recess , no homework , or candy , once a few children vote , the rest will comply and go with the majority . In a different classroom , the majority might vote differently , and most of the children would comply with that majority . When someone ’ s vote changes if it is made in public versus private , this is known as compliance . Compliance can be a form of conformity . Compliance is going along with a request or demand , even if you do not agree with the request .

However , different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages . Other forms of love include liking , which is defined as having intimacy but no passion or commitment . Infatuation is the presence of passion without intimacy or commitment . Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion . Companionate love , which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships , consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion . Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy , but no commitment . Finally , fatuous love is defined by having passion and commitment , but no intimacy , such as a long term sexual love affair . Can you describe other examples of relationships that fit these different types of love ?",1.0190730094909668,1.0

4,"Stanley Milgram was a social psychology professor at Yale who was influenced by the trial of Adolf Eichmann , a Nazi war criminal . Eichmann ’ s defense for the atrocities he committed was that he was “ just following orders . ” Milgram ( 1963 ) wanted to test the validity of this defense , so he designed an experiment and initially recruited 40 men for his experiment . The volunteer participants were led to believe that they were participating in a study to improve learning and memory . The participants were told that they were to teach other students ( learners ) correct answers to a series of test items . The participants were shown how to use a device that they were told delivered electric shocks of different intensities to the learners . The participants were told to shock the learners if they gave a wrong answer to a test item — that the shock would help them to learn . The participants gave ( or believed they gave ) the learners shocks , which increased in 15 - volt increments , all the way up to 450 volts . The participants did not know that the learners were confederates and that the confederates did not actually receive shocks . In response to a string of incorrect answers from the learners , the participants obediently and repeatedly shocked them . The confederate learners cried out for help , begged the participant teachers to stop , and even complained of heart trouble . Yet , when the researcher told the participant-teachers to continue the shock , 65 % of the participants continued the shock to the maximum voltage and to the point that the learner became unresponsive ( Figure 12.20 ) .

4,"Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people , and this behavior is known as discrimination . Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one ’ s membership in a particular group ( Allport , 1954 ; Dovidio & Gaertner , 2004 ) . As a result of holding negative beliefs ( stereotypes ) and negative attitudes ( prejudice ) about a particular group , people often treat the target of prejudice poorly , such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends . An example of a psychologist experiencing gender discrimination is found in the life and studies of Mary Whiton Calkins . Calkins was given special permission to attend graduate seminars at Harvard ( at that time in the late 1880s , Harvard did not accept women ) and at one point was the sole student of the famous psychologist William James . She passed all the requirements needed for a PhD and was described by psychologist Hugo Münsterberg as “ one of the strongest professors of psychology in this country . ” However , Harvard refused to grant Calkins a PhD because she was a woman ( Harvard University , 2019 ) .",0.9964673519134521,0.0
4,"Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy . Empathy is the capacity to understand another person ’ s perspective , to feel what he or she feels . An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others and feels compelled to help ( Batson , 1991 ) . Other researchers argue that altruism is a form of selfless helping that is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself . Certainly , after helping , people feel good about themselves , but some researchers argue that this is a consequence of altruism , not a cause . Other researchers argue that helping is always self-serving because our egos are involved , and we receive benefits from helping ( Cialdini , Brown , Lewis , Luce , & Neuberg 1997 ) . It is challenging to determine experimentally the true motivation for helping , whether is it largely self-serving ( egoism ) or selfless ( altruism ) .

Typically , attitudes are favorable or unfavorable : positive or negative ( Eagly & Chaiken , 1993 ) .

Social loafing occurs when our individual performance cannot be evaluated separately from the group . Thus , group performance declines on easy tasks ( Karau & Williams , 1993 ) . Essentially individual group members loaf and let other group members pick up the slack . Because each individual ’ s efforts cannot be evaluated , individuals become less motivated to perform well . For example , consider a group of people cooperating to clean litter from the roadside . Some people will exert a great amount of effort , while others will exert little effort .

4,"Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex . Typically , sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women , but either sex can show sexism toward their own or their opposite sex . Like racism , sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect . Common forms of sexism in modern society include gender role expectations , such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household . Sexism also includes people ’ s expectations for how members of a gender group should behave . For example , women are expected to be friendly , passive , and nurturing , and when women behave in an unfriendly , assertive , or neglectful manner they often are disliked for violating their gender role ( Rudman , 1998 ) . Research by Laurie Rudman ( 1998 ) finds that when female job applicants self-promote , they are likely to be viewed as competent , but they may be disliked and are less likely to be hired because they violated gender expectations for modesty . Sexism can exist on a societal level such as in hiring , employment opportunities , and education . Women are less likely to be hired or promoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering , aviation , and construction ( Figure 12.23 ) ( Blau , Ferber , & Winkler , 2010 ; Ceci & Williams , 2011 ) .

4,"Returning to our earlier example , Greg knew that he lost his job , but an observer would not know . So a naïve observer would tend to attribute Greg ’ s hostile behavior to Greg ’ s disposition rather than to the true , situational cause . Why do you think we underestimate the influence of the situation on the behaviors of others ? One reason is that we often don ’ t have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person ’ s behavior . The only information we might have is what is observable . Due to this lack of information we have a tendency to assume the behavior is due to a dispositional , or internal , factor . When it comes to explaining our own behaviors , however , we have much more information available to us . If you came home from school or work angry and yelled at your dog or a loved one , what would your explanation be ? You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time — a situational explanation . The actor-observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other people ’ s behavior to internal factors ( fundamental attribution error ) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces ( Jones & Nisbett , 1971 ; Nisbett , Caputo , Legant , & Marecek , 1973 ; Choi & Nisbett , 1998 ) . As actors of behavior , we have more information available to explain our own behavior . However as observers , we have less information available ; therefore , we tend to default to a dispositionist perspective .",0.9818471074104309,1.0
4,"Researchers have tested many persuasion strategies that are effective in selling products and changing people ’ s attitude , ideas , and behaviors . One effective strategy is the foot-in-the-door technique ( Cialdini , 2001 ; Pliner , Hart , Kohl , & Saari , 1974 ) . Using the foot-in-the-door technique , the persuader gets a person to agree to bestow a small favor or to buy a small item , only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item . The foot-in-the-door technique was demonstrated in a study by Freedman and Fraser ( 1966 ) in which participants who agreed to post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put a large sign in their yard than people who declined the first request ( Figure 12.16 ) . Research on this technique also illustrates the principle of consistency ( Cialdini , 2001 ): Our past behavior often directs our future behavior , and we have a desire to maintain consistency once we have a committed to a behavior . A common application of foot-in-the-door is when teens ask their parents for a small permission ( for example , extending curfew by a half hour ) and then asking them for something larger . Having granted the smaller request increases the likelihood that parents will acquiesce with the later , larger request .",1.0184205770492554,0.0
4,"Researchers have documented several characteristics in men and women that humans find attractive . First we look for friends and lovers who are physically attractive . People differ in what they consider attractive , and attractiveness is culturally influenced . Research , however , suggests that some universally attractive features in women include large eyes , high cheekbones , a narrow jaw line , a slender build ( Buss , 1989 ) , and a lower waist-to-hip ratio ( Singh , 1993 ) . For men , attractive traits include being tall , having broad shoulders , and a narrow waist ( Buss , 1989 ) . Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered more attractive than asymmetric individuals ( Fink , Neave , Manning , & Grammer , 2006 ; Penton-Voak et al . , 2001 ; Rikowski & Grammer , 1999 ) . Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth , affection , and social skills ; in males , the attractive traits include achievement , leadership qualities , and job skills ( Regan & Berscheid , 1997 ) . Although humans want mates who are physically attractive , this does not mean that we look for the most attractive person possible . In fact , this observation has led some to propose what is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as their equal in physical attractiveness and social desirability ( Taylor , Fiore , Mendelsohn , & Cheshire , 2011 ) . For example , you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league . So , even if you had proximity to that person , you likely would not ask them out on a date because you believe you likely would be rejected . People weigh a potential partner ’ s attractiveness against the likelihood of success with that person . If you think you are particularly unattractive ( even if you are not ) , you likely will seek partners that are fairly unattractive ( that is , unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior ) .",1.0085573196411133,1.0

In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place , people tend to think that good people experience positive outcomes , and bad people experience negative outcomes ( Jost , Banaji , & Nosek , 2004 ; Jost & Major , 2001 ) . The ability to think of the world as a fair place , where people get what they deserve , allows us to feel that the world is predictable and that we have some control over our life outcomes ( Jost et al . , 2004 ; Jost & Major , 2001 ) . For example , if you want to experience positive outcomes , you just need to work hard to get ahead in life .",1.0022103786468506,0.0

4,"Is the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon ? You may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life . Do people in all cultures commit the fundamental attribution error ? Research suggests that they do not . People from an individualistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy , have the greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error . Individualistic cultures , which tend to be found in western countries such as the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom , promote a focus on the individual . Therefore , a person ’ s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior . In contrast , people from a collectivistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others , such as family , friends , and community ( Figure 12.4 ) , are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error ( Markus & Kitayama , 1991 ; Triandis , 2001 ) .",0.9818751215934753,1.0
4,"Interestingly , the opposite of social loafing occurs when the task is complex and difficult ( Bond & Titus , 1983 ; Geen , 1989 ) . Remember the previous discussion of choking under pressure ? This happens when you perform a difficult task and your individual performance can be evaluated . In a group setting , such as the student work group , if your individual performance cannot be evaluated , there is less pressure for you to do well , and thus less anxiety or physiological arousal ( Latané , Williams , & Harkens , 1979 ) . This puts you in a relaxed state in which you can perform your best , if you choose ( Zajonc , 1965 ) . If the task is a difficult one , many people feel motivated and believe that their group needs their input to do well on a challenging project ( Jackson & Williams , 1985 ) . Given what you learned about social loafing , what advice would you give a new professor about how to design group projects ? If you suggested that individuals ’ efforts should not be evaluated , to prevent the anxiety of choking under pressure , but that the task must be challenging , you have a good understanding of the concepts discussed in this section . Alternatively , you can suggest that individuals ’ efforts should be evaluated , but the task should be easy so as to facilitate performance . Good luck trying to convince your professor to only assign easy projects .",0.9667490720748901,0.0

4,"In the United States , the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human behavior . Why do you think this is ? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors , and , therefore , any behavior change must be due to something internal , such as their personality , habits , or temperament . According to some social psychologists , people tend to overemphasize internal factors as explanations — or attributions — for the behavior of other people . They tend to assume that the behavior of another person is a trait of that person , and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior of others . They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables , and thus to the person ’ s state . This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error ( Ross , 1977 ; Riggio & Garcia , 2009 ) . To better understand , imagine this scenario : Greg returns home from work , and upon opening the front door his wife happily greets him and inquires about his day . Instead of greeting his wife , Greg yells at her , “ Leave me alone ! ” Why did Greg yell at his wife ? How would someone committing the fundamental attribution error explain Greg ’ s behavior ? The most common response is that Greg is a mean , angry , or unfriendly person ( his traits ) . This is an internal or dispositional explanation . However , imagine that Greg was just laid off from his job due to company downsizing . Would your explanation for Greg ’ s behavior change ? Your revised explanation might be that Greg was frustrated and disappointed for losing his job ; therefore , he was in a bad mood ( his state ) . This is now an external or situational explanation for Greg ’ s behavior .",0.9022001624107361,0.0

4,"Can you think of a prejudiced attitude you have held toward a group of people ? How did your prejudice develop ? Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype — that is , a specific belief or assumption about individuals based solely on their membership in a group , regardless of their individual characteristics . Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group . For example , someone holding prejudiced attitudes toward older adults , may believe that older adults are slow and incompetent ( Cuddy , Norton , & Fiske , 2005 ; Nelson , 2004 ) . We cannot possibly know each individual person of advanced age to know that all older adults are slow and incompetent . Therefore , this negative belief is overgeneralized to all members of the group , even though many of the individual group members may in fact be spry and intelligent . Another example of a well-known stereotype involves beliefs about racial differences among athletes . As Hodge , Burden , Robinson , and Bennett ( 2008 ) point out , Black male athletes are often believed to be more athletic , yet less intelligent , than their White male counterparts . These beliefs persist despite a number of high profile examples to the contrary . Sadly , such beliefs often influence how these athletes are treated by others and how they view themselves and their own capabilities . Whether or not you agree with a stereotype , stereotypes are generally well-known within in a given culture ( Devine , 1989 ) .",0.7143787145614624,0.0

What common explanations are given for why people live in poverty ? Have you heard statements such as , “ The poor are lazy and just don ’ t want to work ” or “ Poor people just want to live off the government ” ? What types of explanations are these , dispositional or situational ? These dispositional explanations are clear examples of the fundamental attribution error . Blaming poor people for their poverty ignores situational factors that impact them , such as high unemployment rates , recession , poor educational opportunities , and the familial cycle of poverty ( Figure 12.7 ) . Other research shows that people who hold just-world beliefs have negative attitudes toward people who are unemployed and people living with AIDS ( Sutton & Douglas , 2005 ) . In the United States and other countries , victims of sexual assault may find themselves blamed for their abuse . Victim advocacy groups , such as Domestic Violence Ended ( DOVE ) , attend court in support of victims to ensure that blame is directed at the perpetrators of sexual violence , not the victims . 12.2 Self-presentation Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.06008848175406456,0.0

4,"Bullying involves three parties : the bully , the victim , and witnesses or bystanders . The act of bullying involves an imbalance of power with the bully holding more power — physically , emotionally , and / or socially over the victim . The experience of bullying can be positive for the bully , who may enjoy a boost to self-esteem . However , there are several negative consequences of bullying for the victim , and also for the bystanders . How do you think bullying negatively impacts adolescents ? Being the victim of bullying is associated with decreased mental health , including experiencing anxiety and depression ( APA , 2010 ) . Victims of bullying may underperform in schoolwork ( Bowen , 2011 ) . Bullying also can result in the victim committing suicide ( APA , 2010 ) .

4,"Bullying A modern form of aggression is bullying . As you learn in your study of child development , socializing and playing with other children is beneficial for children ’ s psychological development . However , as you may have experienced as a child , not all play behavior has positive outcomes . Some children are aggressive and want to play roughly . Other children are selfish and do not want to share toys . One form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is bullying . Bullying is repeated negative treatment of another person , often an adolescent , over time ( Olweus , 1993 ) . A one-time incident in which one child hits another child on the playground would not be considered bullying : Bullying is repeated behavior . The negative treatment typical in bullying is the attempt to inflict harm , injury , or humiliation , and bullying can include physical or verbal attacks . However , bullying doesn ’ t have to be physical or verbal , it can be psychological . Research finds gender differences in how girls and boys bully others ( American Psychological Association , 2010 ; Olweus , 1993 ) . Boys tend to engage in direct , physical aggression such as physically harming others . Girls tend to engage in indirect , social forms of aggression such as spreading rumors , ignoring , or socially isolating others .

Maria shops at consignment stores for clothes and economizes where she can . They complain that they never have any money and that they cannot buy anything new .

4,"Behavior is a product of both the situation ( e . g . , cultural influences , social roles , and the presence of bystanders ) and of the person ( e . g . , personality characteristics ) . Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one influence or behavior over others . Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings . In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) . An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament . Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective , whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective . Modern approaches to social psychology , however , take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior ( Fiske , Gilbert , & Lindzey , 2010 ) . In fact , the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study the complex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior ( Mischel , 1977 ; Richard , Bond , & Stokes-Zoota , 2003 ) .",1.011756181716919,0.0

4,"Because of social roles , people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific , familiar settings . A script is a person ’ s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting ( Schank & Abelson , 1977 ) . How do you act on the first day of school , when you walk into an elevator , or are at a restaurant ? For example , at a restaurant in the United States , if we want the server ’ s attention , we try to make eye contact . In Brazil , you would make the sound “ psst ” to get the server ’ s attention . You can see the cultural differences in scripts . To an American , saying “ psst ” to a server might seem rude , yet to a Brazilian , trying to make eye contact might not seem an effective strategy . Scripts are important sources of information to guide behavior in given situations . Can you imagine being in an unfamiliar situation and not having a script for how to behave ? This could be uncomfortable and confusing . How could you find out about social norms in an unfamiliar culture ?",1.00949227809906,1.0
4,"Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect . The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress . Instead , they just watch what is happening . Social psychologists hold that we make these decisions based on the social situation , not our own personality variables . Why do you think the bystanders didn ’ t help Genovese ? What are the benefits to helping her ? What are the risks ? It is very likely you listed more costs than benefits to helping . In this situation , bystanders likely feared for their own lives — if they went to her aid the attacker might harm them . However , how difficult would it have been to make a phone call to the police from the safety of their apartments ? Why do you think no one helped in any way ? Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation . Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( Bandura , 1999 ) . Because there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese , as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building , individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police . The responsibility to call the police was diffused across the number of witnesses to the crime . Have you ever passed an accident on the freeway and assumed that a victim or certainly another motorist has already reported the accident ? In general , the greater the number of bystanders , the less likely any one person will help . 12.7 Prosocial Behavior Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.991252064704895,1.0

In this section , we examine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including social roles , social norms , and scripts . We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source of information , or cues , on how to behave .

4,"As discussed previously in this section , we all belong to a gender , race , age , and social economic group . These groups provide a powerful source of our identity and self-esteem ( Tajfel & Turner , 1979 ) . These groups serve as our in-groups . An in-group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to . A group that we don ’ t belong to , or an out-group , is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us . For example , if you are female , your gender in-group includes all females , and your gender out-group includes all males ( Figure 12.24 ) . People often view gender groups as being fundamentally different from each other in personality traits , characteristics , social roles , and interests . Because we often feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in-groups , we develop in-group bias : a preference for our own group over other groups . This in-group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out-group is perceived as different and is less preferred than our in-group .",1.0156923532485962,0.0

How are we expected to act ? What are we expected to talk about ? What are we expected to wear ?

However , it should be noted that some researchers have suggested that the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed .

4,"As a college student you may have experienced social loafing while working on a group project . Have you ever had to contribute more than your fair share because your fellow group members weren ’ t putting in the work ? This may happen when a professor assigns a group grade instead of individual grades . If the professor doesn ’ t know how much effort each student contributed to a project , some students may be inclined to let more conscientious students do more of the work .

4,"Another phenomenon that occurs within group settings is group polarization . Group polarization ( Teger & Pruitt , 1967 ) is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a group . That is , if a group initially favors a viewpoint , after discussion the group consensus is likely a stronger endorsement of the viewpoint . Conversely , if the group was initially opposed to a viewpoint , group discussion would likely lead to stronger opposition . Group polarization explains many actions taken by groups that would not be undertaken by individuals . Group polarization can be observed at political conventions , when platforms of the party are supported by individuals who , when not in a group , would decline to support them . A more everyday example is a group ’ s discussion of how attractive someone is . Does your opinion change if you find someone attractive , but your friends do not agree ?

From what structure do satellite cells derive during embryologic development ? Another type of sensory ganglion is a cranial nerve ganglion . This is analogous to the dorsal root ganglion , except that it is associated with a cranial nerve instead of a spinal nerve . The roots of cranial nerves are within the cranium , whereas the ganglia are outside the skull . For example , the trigeminal ganglion is superficial to the temporal bone whereas its associated nerve is attached to the mid-pons region of the brain stem .

The superior colliculus is the superior pair and combines sensory information about visual space , auditory space , and somatosensory space . Activity in the superior colliculus is related to orienting the eyes to a sound or touch stimulus . If you are walking along the sidewalk on campus and you hear chirping , the superior colliculus coordinates that information with your awareness of the visual location of the tree right above you .

The pia extends into every convolution of the CNS , lining the inside of the sulci in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices . At the end of the spinal cord , a thin filament extends from the inferior end of CNS at the upper lumbar region of the vertebral column to the sacral end of the vertebral column .

A stroke in the lateral medulla , for example , can cause a loss in the ability to swallow . Sometimes , seemingly unrelated functions will be lost because they are dependent on structures in the same region . Along with the swallowing in the previous example , a stroke in that region could affect sensory functions from the face or extremities because important white matter pathways also pass through the lateral medulla .

5,"The basal nuclei in the cerebrum are connected with a few more nuclei in the brain stem that together act as a functional group that forms a motor pathway . Two streams of information processing take place in the basal nuclei . All input to the basal nuclei is from the cortex into the striatum ( Figure 13.10 ) . The direct pathway is the projection of axons from the striatum to the globus pallidus internal segment ( GPi ) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ) . The GPi / SNr then projects to the thalamus , which projects back to the cortex . The indirect pathway is the projection of axons from the striatum to the globus pallidus external segment ( GPe ) , then to the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) , and finally to GPi / SNr . The two streams both target the GPi / SNr , but one has a direct projection and the other goes through a few intervening nuclei .

5,"Relating Embryonic Development to the Adult Brain Embryonic development can help in understanding the structure of the adult brain because it establishes a framework on which more complex structures can be built . First , the neural tube establishes the anterior – posterior dimension of the nervous system , which is called the neuraxis . The embryonic nervous system in mammals can be said to have a standard arrangement . Humans ( and other primates , to some degree ) make this complicated by standing up and walking on two legs . The anterior – posterior dimension of the neuraxis overlays the superior – inferior dimension of the body . However , there is a major curve between the brain stem and forebrain , which is called the cephalic flexure . Because of this , the neuraxis starts in an inferior position — the end of the spinal cord — and ends in an anterior position , the front of the cerebrum . If this is confusing , just imagine a four-legged animal standing up on two legs .

The complexity of the cerebrum is different across vertebrate species . The cerebrum of the most primitive vertebrates is not much more than the connection for the sense of smell . In mammals , the cerebrum comprises the outer gray matter that is the cortex ( from the Latin word meaning “ bark of a tree ” ) and several deep nuclei that belong to three important functional groups . The basal nuclei are responsible for cognitive processing , the most important function being that associated with planning movements . The basal forebrain contains nuclei that are important in learning and memory . The limbic cortex is the region of the cerebral cortex that is part of the limbic system , a collection of structures involved in emotion , memory , and behavior .",0.922030508518219,0.0

5,"Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses , and students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names . A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet , “ On Old Olympus ’ Towering Tops / A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops , ” in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve . The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming . An exercise to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance . The names of the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function , their source ( sensory ganglion or motor nucleus ) , and their target ( sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle ) . They are listed here with a brief explanation of each nerve ( Figure 13.23 ) . The olfactory nerve and optic nerve are responsible for the sense of smell and vision , respectively . The oculomotor nerve is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the extraocular muscles . It is also responsible for lifting the upper eyelid when the eyes point up , and for pupillary constriction . The trochlear nerve and the abducens nerve are both responsible for eye movement , but do so by controlling different extraocular muscles . The trigeminal nerve is responsible for cutaneous sensations of the face and controlling the muscles of mastication . The facial nerve is responsible for the muscles involved in facial expressions , as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva . The vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for the senses of hearing and balance .

Ascending tracts of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain , whereas descending tracts carry motor commands from the brain . Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally , the columns extend along its length as continuous bands of white matter . Between the two posterior horns of gray matter are the posterior columns . Between the two anterior horns , and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from that gray matter area , are the anterior columns . The white matter on either side of the spinal cord , between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn neurons , are the lateral columns .

5,"Introduction The nervous system is responsible for controlling much of the body , both through somatic ( voluntary ) and autonomic ( involuntary ) functions . The structures of the nervous system must be described in detail to understand how many of these functions are possible . There is a physiological concept known as localization of function that states that certain structures are specifically responsible for prescribed functions . It is an underlying concept in all of anatomy and physiology , but the nervous system illustrates the concept very well . Fresh , unstained nervous tissue can be described as gray or white matter , and within those two types of tissue it can be very hard to see any detail . However , as specific regions and structures have been described , they were related to specific functions . Understanding these structures and the functions they perform requires a detailed description of the anatomy of the nervous system , delving deep into what the central and peripheral structures are . The place to start this study of the nervous system is the beginning of the individual human life , within the womb . The embryonic development of the nervous system allows for a simple framework on which progressively more complicated structures can be built . With this framework in place , a thorough investigation of the nervous system is possible .",0.051770567893981934,0.0

The hypothalamus is a collection of nuclei that are largely involved in regulating homeostasis . The hypothalamus is the executive region in charge of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system through its regulation of the anterior pituitary gland .

5,"In summary , the primary vesicles help to establish the basic regions of the nervous system : forebrain , midbrain , and hindbrain . These divisions are useful in certain situations , but they are not equivalent regions . The midbrain is small compared with the hindbrain and particularly the forebrain . The secondary vesicles go on to establish the major regions of the adult nervous system that will be followed in this text . The telencephalon is the cerebrum , which is the major portion of the human brain . The diencephalon continues to be referred to by this Greek name , because there is no better term for it ( dia - = “ through ” ) . The diencephalon is between the cerebrum and the rest of the nervous system and can be described as the region through which all projections have to pass between the cerebrum and everything else . The brain stem includes the midbrain , pons , and medulla , which correspond to the mesencephalon , metencephalon , and myelencephalon . The cerebellum , being a large portion of the brain , is considered a separate region . Table 13.1 connects the different stages of development to the adult structures of the CNS . One other benefit of considering embryonic development is that certain connections are more obvious because of how these adult structures are related . The retina , which began as part of the diencephalon , is primarily connected to the diencephalon . The eyes are just inferior to the anterior-most part of the cerebrum , but the optic nerve extends back to the thalamus as the optic tract , with branches into a region of the hypothalamus . There is also a connection of the optic tract to the midbrain , but the mesencephalon is adjacent to the diencephalon , so that is not difficult to imagine . The cerebellum originates out of the metencephalon , and its largest white matter connection is to the pons , also from the metencephalon . There are connections between the cerebellum and both the medulla and midbrain , which are adjacent structures in the secondary vesicle stage of development . In the adult brain , the cerebellum seems close to the cerebrum , but there is no direct connection between them .",0.9942505955696106,0.0

The posterior horn is responsible for sensory processing . The anterior horn sends out motor signals to the skeletal muscles . The lateral horn , which is only found in the thoracic , upper lumbar , and sacral regions , contains cell bodies of motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system .",0.9013203382492065,0.0

Fibers from this nucleus enter the cerebellum and are compared with the descending commands from the cerebrum .

Sensory feedback from the muscles and joints , proprioceptive information about the movements of walking , and sensations of balance are sent to the cerebellum through the inferior olive and the cerebellum compares them . If walking is not coordinated , perhaps because the ground is uneven or a strong wind is blowing , then the cerebellum sends out a corrective command to compensate for the difference between the original cortical command and the sensory feedback .

5,"As the embryo develops , a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm , which is the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system . Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the neuroepithelium , forming a neural plate .

The ridge-like edge on either side of the neural groove is referred as the neural fold . As the neural folds come together and converge , the underlying structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called the neural tube . Cells from the neural folds then separate from the ectoderm to form a cluster of cells referred to as the neural crest , which runs lateral to the neural tube . The neural crest migrates away from the nascent , or embryonic , central nervous system ( CNS ) that will form along the neural groove and develops into several parts of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , including the enteric nervous tissue .

5,"Another important aspect of the cranial nerves that lends itself to a mnemonic is the functional role each nerve plays . The nerves fall into one of three basic groups . They are sensory , motor , or both ( see Table 13.3 ) . The sentence , “ Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Brains Beauty Matter More , ” corresponds to the basic function of each nerve . The first , second , and eighth nerves are purely sensory : the olfactory ( CNI ) , optic ( CNII ) , and vestibulocochlear ( CNVIII ) nerves . The three eye-movement nerves are all motor : the oculomotor ( CNIII ) , trochlear ( CNIV ) , and abducens ( CNVI ) . The spinal accessory ( CNXI ) and hypoglossal ( CNXII ) nerves are also strictly motor . The remainder of the nerves contain both sensory and motor fibers . They are the trigeminal ( CNV ) , facial ( CNVII ) , glossopharyngeal ( CNIX ) , and vagus ( CNX ) nerves . The nerves that convey both are often related to each other . The trigeminal and facial nerves both concern the face ; one concerns the sensations and the other concerns the muscle movements . The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are both responsible for conveying gustatory , or taste , sensations as well as controlling salivary glands . The vagus nerve is involved in visceral responses to taste , namely the gag reflex . This is not an exhaustive list of what these combination nerves do , but there is a thread of relation between them .",1.010584831237793,0.0
5,"Another group of autonomic ganglia are the terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves or sacral spinal nerves and are responsible for regulating the parasympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms . These two sets of ganglia , sympathetic and parasympathetic , often project to the same organs — one input from the chain ganglia and one input from a terminal ganglion — to regulate the overall function of an organ . For example , the heart receives two inputs such as these ; one increases heart rate , and the other decreases it . The terminal ganglia that receive input from cranial nerves are found in the head and neck , as well as the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities , whereas the terminal ganglia that receive sacral input are in the lower abdominal and pelvic cavities .",1.0183743238449097,0.0

5,"Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell . It is often the result of the olfactory nerve being severed , usually because of blunt force trauma to the head . The sensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium have a limited lifespan of approximately one to four months , and new ones are made on a regular basis . The new neurons extend their axons into the CNS by growing along the existing fibers of the olfactory nerve . The ability of these neurons to be replaced is lost with age . Age-related anosmia is not the result of impact trauma to the head , but rather a slow loss of the sensory neurons with no new neurons born to replace them .",0.926525890827179,0.0

This type of case occurs when the employer engages in a practice that has a disproportionately injurious impact on a protected class . Disparate impact cases are difficult to prove . The burden of responsibility is on the employee-plaintiff to statistically establish that the action impacts the protected class . The defendant can avoid liability by demonstrating that the practice is a business responsibility . The burden of proof then shifts to the employee to prove that the alleged business necessity is a mere pretext . These steps were established in Griggs v . Duke Power Co . Duke Power required all job applicants to have a high school diploma and to reach a certain minimum score on a professional intelligence test . Willie Griggs , the plaintiff , established that the rule was racially discriminatory because only 12 percent of black men in the state had high school diplomas ( compared to 34 percent of white men ) , and only 6 percent of blacks had passed similar intelligence tests , compared to 58 percent of whites . Duke Power tried to argue that the provisions were necessary to upgrade the quality of the workforce , but the court did not agree that this defense was an adequate business-related justification , and the plaintiff was successful . Sexual harassment is also protected under Title VII . This type of harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances , requests for sexual favors , and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature . Two types of sexual harassment are recognized . Quid pro quo occurs when a manager makes a sexual demand on a worker , and this demand is perceived as a condition of employment . Actions that create a hostile work environment are another type of sexual harassment . These issues have been used in cases of discrimination based on race and religion as well as sex . Since the 1997 case Oncale v . Sundowner Offshore Services Inc . , it has been established that sexual harassment undertaken by a member of one sex against a member of the same sex is actionable under Title VII . In some limited circumstances , employers may also be liable for harassment of employees by non-employees , e . g . , customers . The employer is liable if it does nothing to prevent and remedy harassment targeted at one of its employees . The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1987 expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on pregnancy , childbirth , or medical conditions related to the same .",1.0135729312896729,0.0

Workers in low-paying service jobs might find it harder to get to the polls because they lack flexibility in their work hours and quality daycare to look after children while they vote .

E . ) opined , “ The measure of a man is what he does with power , ” and Lord Acton perhaps more famously asserted , “ Power tends to corrupt ; absolute power corrupts absolutely ” ( 1887 ) . Indeed , the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations , and the term itself is difficult to define . Many scholars adopt the definition developed by German sociologist Max Weber , who said that power is the ability to exercise one ’ s will over others ( Weber 1922 ) . Power affects more than personal relationships ; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups , professional organizations , and governments . Similarly , a government ’ s power is not necessarily limited to control of its own citizens . A dominant nation , for instance , will often use its clout to influence or support other governments or to seize control of other nation states . Efforts by the U . S . government to wield power in other countries have included joining with other nations to form the Allied forces during World War II , entering Iraq in 2002 to topple Saddam Hussein ’ s regime , and imposing sanctions on the government of North Korea in the hopes of constraining its development of nuclear weapons . Endeavors to gain power and influence do not necessarily lead to violence , exploitation , or abuse . Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr . and Mohandas Gandhi , for example , commanded powerful movements that affected positive change without military force .

Although the Cherokee followed the lead of their White neighbors by farming and owning property , as well as embracing Christianity and enslaving people , this proved of little consequence in an era when Whites perceived all Native Americans as incapable of becoming full citizens of the republic .",0.03482120856642723,0.0

In November , South Carolina passed the Ordinance of Nullification , declaring the 1828 and 1832 tariffs null and void in the Palmetto State . Jackson responded , however , by declaring in the December 1832 Nullification Proclamation that a state did not have the power to void a federal law . With the states and the federal government at an impasse , civil war seemed a real possibility . The next governor of South Carolina , Robert Hayne , called for a force of ten thousand volunteers ( Figure 10.9 ) to defend the state against any federal action . At the same time , South Carolinians who opposed the nullifiers told Jackson that eight thousand men stood ready to defend the Union . Congress passed the Force Bill of 1833 , which gave the federal government the right to use federal troops to ensure compliance with federal law . The crisis — or at least the prospect of armed conflict in South Carolina — was defused by the Compromise Tariff of 1833 , which reduced tariff rates considerably .

Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine ; namely , A pairs with T and G pairs with C . Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs , and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs . The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds ; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds .

The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure , whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside . Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm , and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm . Therefore , ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix . The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2 nm , and it is uniform throughout . Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter .

10,"The first draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was recently published by Richard E . Green et al . in 2010 . 1 Neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans . They were known to have lived in Europe and Western Asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago . Green ’ s team studied almost 40,000- year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world . Extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and DNA sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination . In their study , the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs . The Neanderthal sequence was compared with that of present-day humans from across the world . After comparing the sequences , the researchers found that the Neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside Africa than to people in Africa . While current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in Africa , the data from the Neanderthal genome may contradict this view . Green and his colleagues also discovered DNA segments among people in Europe and Asia that are more similar to Neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences . Another interesting observation was that Neanderthals are as closely related to people from Papua New Guinea as to those from China or France . This is surprising because Neanderthal fossil remains have been located only in Europe and West Asia . Most likely , genetic exchange took place between Neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans emerged out of Africa , before the divergence of Europeans , East Asians , and Papua New Guineans . 1 Richard E . Green et al . , “ A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome , ” Science 328 ( 2010 ): 710-22 . Several genes seem to have undergone changes from Neanderthals during the evolution of present-day humans . These genes are involved in cranial structure , metabolism , skin morphology , and cognitive development . One of the genes that is of particular interest is RUNX 2 , which is different in modern day humans and Neanderthals . This gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone , bell-shaped rib cage , and dental differences seen in Neanderthals . It is speculated that an evolutionary change in RUNX 2 was important in the origin of modern-day humans , and this affected the cranium and the upper body .",0.9573530554771423,0.0

The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge . Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14 N and spun again . During the density gradient centrifugation , the DNA is loaded into a gradient ( typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose ) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm . Under these circumstances , the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient . DNA grown in 15 N will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14 N .

This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication . The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14 N formed two bands : one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15 N and 14 N , and the other corresponded to the band of 14 N DNA .

The tightly packaged region is known as heterochromatin , and the less dense region is known as euchromatin . Heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed , and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres . The euchromatin usually contains genes that are transcribed , with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted . 14.3 Basics of DNA Replication Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9630112648010254,0.0

10,"In conservative replication , the parental DNA remains together , and the newly formed daughter strands are together . The semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be synthesized ; after replication , each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “ old ” strand and one “ new ” strand . In the dispersive model , both copies of DNA have double-stranded segments of parental DNA and newly synthesized DNA interspersed .",0.665493905544281,0.0
10,"In another type of repair mechanism , nucleotide excision repair , enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3 ' and 5 ' ends of the incorrect base ( Figure 14.19 ) . The segment of DNA is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of DNA pol . Once the bases are filled in , the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by DNA ligase . This repair mechanism is often employed when UV exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers .",0.9824045300483704,0.0

This may have potential in regenerative medicine . 2 Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies ; these mice have tissue atrophy , stem cell depletion , organ system failure , and impaired tissue injury responses . Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres , reduced DNA damage , reversed neurodegeneration , and improved the function of the testes , spleen , and intestines .

10,"How does the replication machinery know where to begin ? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where replication begins . In E . coli , which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome ( as do most prokaryotes ) , it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences . The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site . An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs . ATP hydrolysis is required for this process . As the DNA opens up , Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed . Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi - directionally as replication proceeds . Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix . DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction ( a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction ) . It also requires a free 3 ' - OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3 ' - OH end and the 5 ' phosphate of the next nucleotide . This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3 ' - OH group is not available . Then how does it add the first nucleotide ? The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3 ' - OH end . Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA . Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer . DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer , adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand ( Figure 14.14 ) .",0.9669660925865173,1.0

After cooling , the gel solution is poured into a casting tray . Once the gel has solidified , the DNA is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied . The DNA has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode . The electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the DNA separate according to size ; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well ( where the DNA was loaded ) , and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well . Once the DNA is separated , the gel is stained with a DNA-specific dye for viewing it ( Figure 14.9 ) .",0.9961332082748413,0.0

10,"Experiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins . Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage , which is a virus that infects bacteria . Viruses typically have a simple structure : a protein coat , called the capsid , and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material , either DNA or RNA . The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface , and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell . The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery , and eventually the host cell bursts , releasing a large number of bacteriophages . Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur , 35 S , to label the protein coat . Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus , 32 P . Because phosphorous is found in DNA , but not protein , the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus .",1.0075615644454956,1.0

DNA can be retrieved from hair , blood , or saliva . Each person ’ s DNA is unique , and it is possible to detect differences between individuals within a species on the basis of these unique features . DNA analysis has many practical applications beyond forensics . In humans , DNA testing is applied to numerous uses : determining paternity , tracing genealogy , identifying pathogens , archeological research , tracing disease outbreaks , and studying human migration patterns . In the medical field , DNA is used in diagnostics , new vaccine development , and cancer therapy . It is now possible to determine predisposition to diseases by looking at genes . Each human cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes : one set of chromosomes is inherited from the mother and the other set is inherited from the father . There is also a mitochondrial genome , inherited exclusively from the mother , which can be involved in inherited genetic disorders . On each chromosome , there are thousands of genes that are responsible for determining the genotype and phenotype of the individual . A gene is defined as a sequence of DNA that codes for a functional product .

10,"A well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa ( Figure 14.20 ) . Affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to UV rays from the sun . When individuals are exposed to UV , pyrimidine dimers , especially those of thymine , are formed ; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage . These are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes , whereas in normal individuals , the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected . The thymine dimers distort the structure of the DNA double helix , and this may cause problems during DNA replication . People with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than those who dont have the condition . Errors during DNA replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in DNA . Mutations , variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome , can also occur because of damage to DNA . Such mutations may be of two types : induced or spontaneous . Induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals , UV rays , x-rays , or some other environmental agent .

10,"A helicase using the energy from ATP hydrolysis opens up the DNA helix . Replication forks are formed at each replication origin as the DNA unwinds . The opening of the double helix causes over-winding , or supercoiling , in the DNA ahead of the replication fork . These are resolved with the action of topoisomerases . Primers are formed by the enzyme primase , and using the primer , DNA pol can start synthesis . While the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol δ , the lagging strand is synthesized by pol ε . A sliding clamp protein known as PCNA ( Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen ) holds the DNA pol in place so that it does not slide off the DNA .

10,"A half century later , British bacteriologist Frederick Griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another “ horizontally , ” rather than by descent . In 1928 , he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation , a process in which external DNA is taken up by a cell , thereby changing morphology and physiology . He was working with Streptococcus pneumoniae , the bacterium that causes pneumonia . Griffith worked with two strains , rough ( R ) and smooth ( S ) . The R strain is non-pathogenic ( does not cause disease ) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule ; as a result , the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope . The S strain is pathogenic ( disease-causing ) and has a capsule outside its cell wall . As a result , it has a smooth appearance under the microscope . Griffith injected the live R strain into mice and they survived . In another experiment , when he injected mice with the heat-killed S strain , they also survived . In a third set of experiments , a mixture of live R strain and heat-killed S strain were injected into mice , and — to his surprise — the mice died . Upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse , only the S strain of bacteria was recovered . When this isolated S strain was injected into fresh mice , the mice died . Griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed S strain into the live R strain and transformed it into the pathogenic S strain , and he called this the transforming principle ( Figure 14.3 ) . These experiments are now famously known as Griffith's transformation experiments .",0.9882583618164062,0.0

To Durkheim , society was greater than the sum of its parts . He asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior , and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual ’ s actions . Durkheim called the communal beliefs , morals , and attitudes of a society the collective conscience . In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) .

People , while more interdependent to accomplish complex tasks , are also alienated from each other . Anomie is experienced in times of social uncertainty , such as war , or a great upturn or downturn in the economy . As societies reach an advanced stage of organic solidarity , they avoid anomie by redeveloping a set of shared norms .

For example , a teenager who is repeatedly given a label — overachiever , player , bum — might live up to the term even though it initially wasn ’ t a part of his character . Like Berger and Luckmann ’ s description of habitualization , Thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by “ successive definitions of the situation . ” This concept is defined by sociologist Robert K . Merton as a self-fulfilling prophecy . Merton explains that with a self-fulfilling prophecy , even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon . One example he gives is of a “ bank run . ” Say for some reason , a number of people falsely fear that their bank is soon to be bankrupt . Because of this false notion , people run to their bank and demand all their cash at once .

Marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of social revolution . These revolutions or “ class antagonisms ” as he called them , were a result of one class dominating another . Most recently , with the end of feudalism , a new revolutionary class he called the bourgeoisie dominated the proletariat laborers . The bourgeoisie were revolutionary in the sense that they represented a radical change in the structure of society . In Marx ’ s words , “ Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps , into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat ” ( Marx and Engels 1848 ) .",0.9963337779045105,1.0

12,"William James ( 1842 – 1910 ) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( Figure 1.4 ) . James was introduced to Darwin ’ s theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism ’ s characteristics . Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are adapted to their environment , including their behavior . Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual , because it has been naturally selected . As James saw it , psychology ’ s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world , and as such , his perspective was known as functionalism . Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment . Functionalism has a second , more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts , which were the focus of structuralism . Like Wundt , James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental activities , but James also relied on more objective measures , including the use of various recording devices , and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology ( Gordon , 1995 ) .",0.9768747687339783,0.0
12,"Wilhelm Wundt ( 1832 – 1920 ) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist . His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873 . Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience , and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience . Wundt used introspection ( he called it “ internal perception ” ) , a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible , making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed . Wundt ’ s version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable ( repeatable ) experience of the mind ( Danziger , 1980 ) . The first stringent requirement was the use of “ trained ” or practiced observers , who could immediately observe and report a reaction . The second requirement was the use of repeatable stimuli that always produced the same experience in the subject and allowed the subject to expect and thus be fully attentive to the inner reaction . These experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate “ interpretation ” in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately , since it cannot be seen by any other person . This attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as structuralism . Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 ( Figure 1.3 ) . In this laboratory , Wundt and his students conducted experiments on , for example , reaction times . A subject , sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist , would receive a stimulus such as a light , image , or sound . The subject ’ s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button , and an apparatus would record the time to reaction . Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second ( Nicolas & Ferrand , 1999 ) .",1.0031250715255737,0.0

12,"While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a human or other animal , evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior . To the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics , a behavior , like any anatomical characteristic of a human or animal , will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings . These surroundings include the physical environment and , since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction , the social environment . The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin , the co-discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection . Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be adaptive and wrote books titled , The Descent of Man ( 1871 ) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) , to explore this field .",0.554756224155426,0.0

12,"Unfortunately , in moving to the United States , these men were forced to abandon much of their work and were unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale . These factors along with the rise of behaviorism ( described next ) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in the United States as they had been in their native Germany ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) . Despite these issues , several Gestalt principles are still very influential today . Considering the human individual as a whole rather than as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the century . The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception . Structuralism , Freud , and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing and understanding inner experience . But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior , the objectively observable outcome of mental processes .",0.1754719316959381,0.0

12,"There are many interesting examples of social psychological research , and you will read about many of these in a later chapter of this textbook . Until then , you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted . Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience . After the holocaust , in 1961 , a Nazi war criminal , Adolf Eichmann , who was accused of committing mass atrocities , was put on trial . Many people wondered how German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps , and they were unsatisfied with the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders . At the time , most psychologists agreed that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering , simply because they were obeying orders . Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true ( Figure 1.15 ) . As you will read later in the text , Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person , simply because they were instructed to do so by an authority figure ( in this case , a man dressed in a lab coat ) . This was in spite of the fact that participants received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study . No one was actually hurt or harmed in any way , Milgram ’ s experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates , those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have clear , specific directions on how to behave during the research study ( Hock , 2009 ) . Milgram ’ s and others ’ studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research subjects , unless it can be argued not to cause harm and , in general , requiring informed consent of participants .",0.4840176999568939,0.0

Within the last few years , however , several states have begun to remove this requirement , which would allow someone to get an earlier start in his career ( Munsey , 2009 ) .

12,"Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’ s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ); in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly . The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) . The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind . Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge . To apply the scientific method , a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation , called a hypothesis , to explain the phenomenon . A hypothesis is not just any explanation ; it should fit into the context of a scientific theory . A scientific theory is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time . A theory is the best understanding that we have of that part of the natural world . Armed with the hypothesis , the researcher then makes observations or , better still , carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis . That test and its results are then published so that others can check the results or build on them . It is necessary that any explanation in science be testable , which means that the phenomenon must be perceivable and measurable . For example , that a bird sings because it is happy is not a testable hypothesis , since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird . We must ask a different question , perhaps about the brain state of the bird , since this can be measured . In general , science deals only with matter and energy , that is , those things that can be measured , and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality . This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited , since thoughts , at least as we experience them , are neither matter nor energy . The scientific method is also a form of empiricism . An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities .",1.0119547843933105,1.0

Specifically , Freud theorized that an individual went through various psychosexual stages of development .

Freud theorized that many of his patients ’ problems arose from the unconscious mind . In Freud ’ s view , the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness . Gaining access to the unconscious , then , was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient ’ s problems . According to Freud , the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis , by examinations of the first words that came to people ’ s minds , and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue . Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the role of a person ’ s unconscious , as well as early childhood experiences , and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .",1.003060221672058,0.0

For example , a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments , but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody , rhythm , and harmony . In many ways , this particular perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt ’ s ideas of structuralism ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) .",0.9743118286132812,1.0

12,"John B . Watson ( 1878 – 1958 ) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University ( Figure 1.6 ) . While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience , Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed . Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible , Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control . Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior , and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as behaviorism . A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism . Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could , to some degree , be applied to human behavior . Indeed , Tolman ( 1938 ) stated , “ I believe that everything important in psychology ( except … such matters as involve society and words ) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze . ”",0.9983686208724976,0.0

To be subject to evolution by natural selection , a behavior must have a significant genetic cause . In general , we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically , since the genetic differences among human groups are small . The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make observations , or conduct experiments , to determine whether the results match the theory . It is important to recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive , since they lack information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural ( Endler , 1986 ) . Demonstrating that a trait , especially in humans , is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult ; perhaps for this reason , some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants ( Confer et al . , 2010 ) .",0.3642430007457733,0.0

The reflex Pavlov worked with was salivation in response to the presence of food . The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second stimulus , such as a specific sound , that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several times .

Object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist , even if they are hidden from us . If you were to show an adult a toy , and then hide it behind a curtain , the adult knows that the toy still exists . However , very young infants act as if a hidden object no longer exists .

Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core , because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment . Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized personal control , intentionality , and a true predisposition for “ good ” as important for our self-concept and our behavior . Thus , humanism emerged . Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans .

Women , members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other countries , and individuals with sexual orientations other than heterosexual had difficulties entering the field of psychology and therefore influencing its development . They also suffered from the attitudes of white , male psychologists , who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they developed and worked . Until the 1960s , the science of psychology was largely a “ womanless ” psychology ( Crawford & Marecek , 1989 ) , meaning that few women were able to practice psychology , so they had little influence on what was studied .

12,"Culture has important impacts on individuals and social psychology , yet the effects of culture on psychology are under-studied . There is a risk that psychological theories and data derived from white , American settings could be assumed to apply to individuals and social groups from other cultures and this is unlikely to be true ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) . One weakness in the field of cross-cultural psychology is that in looking for differences in psychological attributes across cultures , there remains a need to go beyond simple descriptive statistics ( Betancourt & López , 1993 ) . In this sense , it has remained a descriptive science , rather than one seeking to determine cause and effect . For example , a study of characteristics of individuals seeking treatment for a binge eating disorder in Hispanic American , African American , and Caucasian American individuals found significant differences between groups ( Franko et al . , 2012 ) . The study concluded that results from studying any one of the groups could not be extended to the other groups , and yet potential causes of the differences were not measured . This history of multicultural psychology in the United States is a long one . The role of African American psychologists in researching the cultural differences between African American individual and social psychology is but one example . In 1920 , Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United States . Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University , leading to the education of a new generation of African American psychologists ( Black , Spence , and Omari , 2004 ) . Much of the work of early African American psychologists ( and a general focus of much work in first half of the 20th century in psychology in the United States ) was dedicated to testing and intelligence testing in particular ( Black et al . , 2004 ) . That emphasis has continued , particularly because of the importance of testing in determining opportunities for children , but other areas of exploration in African American psychology research include learning style , sense of community and belonging , and spiritualism ( Black et al . , 2004 ) . Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband , Kenneth Clark . They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and internalized racism , research that was instrumental in the Brown v .

Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind , client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session . Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach : unconditional positive regard , genuineness , and empathy .

Critical thinking is the active application of a set of skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information . The evaluation of information — assessing its reliability and usefulness — is an important skill in a world full of competing “ facts , ” many of which are designed to be misleading . For example , critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude of skepticism , recognizing internal biases , making use of logical thinking , asking appropriate questions , and making observations . Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of their undergraduate coursework ( American Psychological Association , 2011 ) . Together , these factors increase students ’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they encounter . In addition to these broad-based skills , psychology students come to understand the complex factors that shape one ’ s behavior .

12,"An article by Naomi Weisstein , first published in 1968 ( Weisstein , 1993 ) , stimulated a feminist revolution in psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science . She also specifically criticized male psychologists for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women . Weisstein used , as examples , statements by prominent psychologists in the 1960s , such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim : “ . . . we must start with the realization that , as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers , they want first and foremost to be womanly companions of men and to be mothers . ” Weisstein ’ s critique formed the foundation for the subsequent development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our knowledge of the psychology of women and , indeed , of both genders . Crawford & Marecek ( 1989 ) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist psychology . These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology , studying psychological gender differences , and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the scientific approach to knowledge .",0.9439212679862976,0.0

Chomsky ( 1928 – ) , an American linguist , was dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology . He believed that psychology ’ s focus on behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior ( Miller , 2003 ) .",0.062362827360630035,0.0
12,"Abraham Maslow ( 1908 – 1970 ) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior ( Figure 1.8 ) . Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief overview will be provided here . Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met ( e . g . , food , water , shelter ) , higher-level needs ( e . g . , social needs ) would begin to motivate behavior . According to Maslow , the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization , a process by which we achieve our full potential . Obviously , the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic of the humanistic perspective is evident ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) . Humanistic psychologists rejected , on principle , the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and biological sciences , because it missed the “ whole ” human being . Beginning with Maslow and Rogers , there was an insistence on a humanistic research program . This program has been largely qualitative ( not measurement-based ) , but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology , including research on happiness , self-concept , meditation , and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy ( Friedman , 2008 ) .",0.9924599528312683,1.0

She wouldn ’ t want people to think she was too poor to find proper clothes . Conformity is the extent to which an individual complies with group norms or expectations . As you might recall , we use reference groups to assess and understand how to act , to dress , and to behave . Not surprisingly , young people are particularly aware of who conforms and who does not . A high school boy whose mother makes him wear ironed button-down shirts might protest that he will look stupid – – that everyone else wears T-shirts . Another high school boy might like wearing those shirts as a way of standing out . How much do you enjoy being noticed ?

Too much adherence to explicit rules and a division of labor can leave an organization behind . And unfortunately , once established , bureaucracies can take on a life of their own .

State governments and current budget crises are examples of this challenge . It is almost impossible to make quick changes , leading states to continue , year after year , with increasingly unbalanced budgets .

13,"These reference groups can also become your in-groups or out-groups . For instance , different groups on campus might solicit you to join . Are there fraternities and sororities at your school ? If so , chances are they will try to convince students — that is , students they deem worthy — to join them . And if you love playing soccer and want to play on a campus team , but you ’ re wearing shredded jeans , combat boots , and a local band T-shirt , you might have a hard time convincing the soccer team to give you a chance . While most campus groups refrain from insulting competing groups , there is a definite sense of an in-group versus an out-group . “ Them ? ” a member might say . “ They ’ re all right , but their parties are nowhere near as cool as ours . ” Or , “ Only serious engineering geeks join that group . ” This immediate categorization into in-groups and out-groups means that students must choose carefully , since whatever group they associate with won ’ t just define their friends — it may also define their enemies . 6.2 Group Size and Structure",0.881744384765625,0.0
13,"The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings , from just two people ( think about a “ group project ” in school when you partner with another student ) , a club , a regular gathering of friends , or people who work together or share a hobby . In short , the term refers to any collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their identity is somehow aligned with the group . Of course , every time people are gathered it is not necessarily a group . A rally is usually a one-time event , for instance , and belonging to a political party doesn ’ t imply interaction with others . People who exist in the same place at the same time , but who do not interact or share a sense of identity — such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks — are considered an aggregate , or a crowd . Another example of a non-group is people who share similar characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way . These people would be considered a category , and an example would be that all children born from approximately 1980 – 2000 are referred to as “ Millennial . ” Why are Millennials a category and not a group ?

If even one person in the group also dissented , the subject conformed only a quarter as often . Clearly , it was easier to be a minority of two than a minority of one .

13,"The McDonaldization of Society ( Ritzer 1993 ) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business model in common social institutions . This business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , predictability , calculability , and control ( monitoring ) . For example , in your average chain grocery store , people at the register check out customers while stockers keep the shelves full of goods and deli workers slice meats and cheese to order ( efficiency ) . Whenever you enter a store within that grocery chain , you receive the same type of goods , see the same store organization , and find the same brands at the same prices ( predictability ) . You will find that goods are sold by the pound , so that you can weigh your fruit and vegetable purchase rather than simply guessing at the price for that bag of onions , while the employees use a timecard to calculate their hours and receive overtime pay ( calculability ) . Finally , you will notice that all store employees are wearing a uniform ( and usually a name tag ) so that they can be easily identified . There are security cameras to monitor the store , and some parts of the store , such as the stockroom , are generally considered off-limits to customers ( control ) . While McDonaldization has resulted in improved profits and an increased availability of various goods and services to more people worldwide , it has also reduced the variety of goods available in the marketplace while rendering available products uniform , generic , and bland . Think of the difference between a mass-produced shoe and one made by a local cobbler , between a chicken from a family-owned farm versus a corporate grower , or a cup of coffee from the local diner instead of one from Starbucks .",0.9927469491958618,1.0

The book and movie Fast Food Nation : The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schossler paints an ugly picture of what goes in , what goes on , and what comes out of fast food chains . From their environmental impact to their role in the US obesity epidemic , fast food chains are connected to numerous societal ills . Furthermore , working at a fast food restaurant is often disparaged , and even referred to dismissively , as a McJob rather than a real job .

His book , My Secret Life on the McJob documents his experience . Newman found , unlike Schossler , that these restaurants have much good alongside the bad . Specifically , he asserted that the employees were honest and hardworking , the management was often impressive , and that the jobs required a lot more skill and effort than most people imagined . In the book , Newman cites a pharmaceutical executive who states that a fast-food service job on an applicant ’ s résumé is a plus because it indicates the employee is reliable and can handle pressure .

13,"Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864 – 1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) . According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives . The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face-to-face in long-term emotional ways . This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones . The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization . The best example of a primary group is the family . Secondary groups are often larger and impersonal . They may also be task-focused and time-limited . These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal - or task-oriented than emotional . A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group . Neither primary nor secondary groups are bound by strict definitions or set limits . In fact , people can move from one group to another . A graduate seminar , for example , can start as a secondary group focused on the class at hand , but as the students work together throughout their program , they may find common interests and strong ties that transform them into a primary group .",1.0180996656417847,1.0
13,"Sociologist Amitai Etzioni ( 1975 ) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories . Normative organizations , also called voluntary organizations , are based on shared interests . As the name suggests , joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership rewarding in an intangible way . The Audubon Society or a ski club are examples of normative organizations . Coercive organizations are groups that one must be coerced , or pushed , to join . These may include prison or a rehabilitation center . Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) . A total institution refers to one in which inmates live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place . The third type is utilitarian organizations , which , as the name suggests , are joined because of the need for a specific material reward . High school or a workplace would fall into this category — one joined in pursuit of a diploma , the other in order to make money .",1.0222102403640747,1.0

However , the subject was led to believe that the others were all , like him , people brought in for an experiment in visual judgments . The group was shown two cards , the first card with a single vertical line , and the second card with three vertical lines differing in length . The experimenter polled the group , asking each participant one at a time which line on the second card matched up with the line on the first card . However , this was not really a test of visual judgment . Rather , it was Asch ’ s study on the pressures of conformity . He was curious to see what the effect of multiple wrong answers would be on the subject , who presumably was able to tell which lines matched . In order to test this , Asch had each planted respondent answer in a specific way . The subject was seated in such a way that he had to hear almost everyone else ’ s answers before it was his turn .

Asch revised the study and repeated it , wherein the subject still heard the staged wrong answers , but was allowed to write down his answer rather than speak it aloud . In this version , the number of examples of conformity – – giving an incorrect answer so as not to contradict the group – – fell by two thirds .

13,"One of the ways that groups can be powerful is through inclusion , and its inverse , exclusion . In-groups and out-groups are subcategories of primary and secondary groups that help identify this dynamic . Primary groups consist of both in-groups and out-groups , as do secondary groups . The feeling that one belongs in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way . Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840 – 1910 ) developed the concepts of in-group and out-group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) . In short , an in-group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is . An out-group , conversely , is a group someone doesn ’ t belong to ; often there may be a feeling of disdain or competition in relation to an out-group . Sports teams , unions , and sororities are examples of in-groups and out-groups ; people may belong to , or be an outsider to , any of these . While these affiliations can be neutral or even positive , such as the case of a team sport competition , the concept of in-groups and out-groups can also explain some negative human behavior , such as white supremacist movements like the Ku Klux Klan , or the bullying of gay or lesbian students . By defining others as “ not like us ” and inferior , in-groups can end up practicing ethnocentrism , racism , sexism , ageism , and heterosexism — manners of judging others negatively based on their culture , race , sex , age , or sexuality . Often , in-groups can form within a secondary group . For instance , a workplace can have cliques of people , from senior executives who play golf together , to engineers who write code together , to young singles who socialize after hours . While these in-groups might show favoritism and affinity for other in-group members , the overall organization may be unable or unwilling to acknowledge it . Therefore , it pays to be wary of the politics of in-groups , since members may exclude others as a form of gaining status within the group .",1.0135200023651123,1.0

And although gender roles have changed , even today many women and men who exhibit the opposite-gender manner can be seen as deviants and can encounter resistance . Secretary of State and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton provides an example of how society reacts to a high-profile woman who is an instrumental leader . Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership .",1.0101021528244019,1.0

13,"Interestingly , people within an aggregate or category can become a group . During disasters , people in a neighborhood ( an aggregate ) who did not know each other might become friendly and depend on each other at the local shelter . After the disaster ends and the people go back to simply living near each other , the feeling of cohesiveness may last since they have all shared an experience . They might remain a group , practicing emergency readiness , coordinating supplies for next time , or taking turns caring for neighbors who need extra help . Similarly , there may be many groups within a single category . Consider teachers , for example . Within this category , groups may exist like teachers ’ unions , teachers who coach , or staff members who are involved with the PTA .",0.16539770364761353,0.0

13,"In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles . Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making . These leaders work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward . This type of leader is particularly common , for example , in a club where the members vote on which activities or projects to pursue . These leaders can be well liked , but there is often a challenge that the work will proceed slowly since consensus building is time-consuming . A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution . In contrast , a laissez-faire leader ( French for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands-off , allowing group members to self-manage and make their own decisions . An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress . As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks . These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals . Often , entrepreneurs fall into this mold , like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg . Not surprisingly , this type of leader risks alienating the workers . There are times , however , when this style of leadership can be required . In different circumstances , each of these leadership styles can be effective and successful . Consider what leadership style you prefer . Why ? Do you like the same style in different areas of your life , such as a classroom , a workplace , and a sports team ?",0.9439945816993713,1.0

13,"Finally , bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality , which takes personal feelings out of professional situations . This characteristic grew , to some extent , out of a desire to protect organizations from nepotism , backroom deals , and other types of favoritism , simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the organization . Impersonality is an attempt by large formal organizations to protect their members . However , the result is often that personal experience is disregarded . For example , you may be late for work because your car broke down , but the manager at Pizza Hut doesn ’ t care about why you are late , only that you are late . Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice . In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript . In order to become a lawyer and represent clients , you must graduate law school and pass the state bar exam . Of course , there are many well-documented examples of success by those who did not proceed through traditional meritocracies . Think about technology companies with founders who dropped out of college , or performers who became famous after a YouTube video went viral . How well do you think established meritocracies identify talent ? Wealthy families hire tutors , interview coaches , test-prep services , and consultants to help their kids get into the best schools . This starts as early as kindergarten in New York City , where competition for the most highly-regarded schools is especially fierce . Are these schools , many of which have copious scholarship funds that are intended to make the school more democratic , really offering all applicants a fair shake ? There are several positive aspects of bureaucracies . They are intended to improve efficiency , ensure equal opportunities , and increase efficiency . And there are times when rigid hierarchies are needed . But remember that many of our bureaucracies grew large at the same time that our school model was developed – – during the Industrial Revolution . Young workers were trained and organizations were built for mass production , assembly line work , and factory jobs . In these scenarios , a clear chain of command was critical . Now , in the information age , this kind of rigid training and adherence to protocol can actually decrease both productivity and efficiency .",1.0070579051971436,1.0

In the aftermath of her death , the bullies were prosecuted in the legal system and the state passed anti-bullying legislation . This marked a significant change in how bullying , including cyberbullying , is viewed in the United States . Now there are numerous resources for schools , families , and communities to provide education and prevention on this issue . The White House hosted a Bullying Prevention summit in March 2011 , and President and First Lady Obama have used Facebook and other social media sites to discuss the importance of the issue .

13,"Bureaucracies are an ideal type of formal organization . Pioneer sociologist Max Weber popularly characterized a bureaucracy as having a hierarchy of authority , a clear division of labor , explicit rules , and impersonality ( 1922 ) . People often complain about bureaucracies – – declaring them slow , rule-bound , difficult to navigate , and unfriendly . Let ’ s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own superiors . For example , as an employee at Walmart , your shift manager assigns you tasks . Your shift manager answers to his store manager , who must answer to her regional manager , and so on in a chain of command , up to the CEO who must answer to the board members , who in turn answer to the stockholders . Everyone in this bureaucracy follows the chain of command .",1.0095820426940918,1.0
13,"Big Picture Women Leaders and the Hillary Clinton / Sarah Palin Phenomenon The 2008 presidential election marked a dynamic change when two female politicians entered the race . Of the 200 people who have run for president during the country ’ s history , fewer than 30 have been women . Democratic presidential candidate and former First Lady Hillary Clinton was both famously polarizing and popular . She had almost as many passionate supporters as she did people who reviled her . On the other side of the aisle was Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin . The former governor of Alaska , Palin was , to some , the perfect example of the modern woman . She juggled her political career with raising a growing family , and relied heavily on the use of social media to spread her message . So what light did these candidates ’ campaigns shed on the possibilities of a female presidency ? According to some political analysts , women candidates face a paradox : They must be as tough as their male opponents on issues such as foreign policy or risk appearing weak . However , the stereotypical expectation of women as expressive leaders is still prevalent . Consider that Hillary Clinton ’ s popularity surged in her 2008 campaign after she cried on the campaign trail . It was enough for the New York Times to publish an editorial , “ Can Hillary Cry Her Way Back to the White House ? ” ( Dowd 2008 ) . Harsh , but her approval ratings soared afterwards . In fact , many compared it to how politically likable she was in the aftermath of President Clinton ’ s Monica Lewinsky scandal . Sarah Palin ’ s expressive qualities were promoted to a greater degree . While she has benefited from the efforts of feminists before her , she self-identified as a traditional woman with traditional values , a point she illustrated by frequently bringing her young children up on stage with her .",0.022856177762150764,0.0
13,"Big Picture Bullying and Cyberbullying : How Technology Has Changed the Game Most of us know that the old rhyme “ sticks and stones may break my bones , but words will never hurt me ” is inaccurate . Words can hurt , and never is that more apparent than in instances of bullying . Bullying has always existed , often reaching extreme levels of cruelty in children and young adults . People at these stages of life are especially vulnerable to others ’ opinions of them , and they ’ re deeply invested in their peer groups . Today , technology has ushered in a new era of this dynamic . Cyberbullying is the use of interactive media by one person to torment another , and it is on the rise . Cyberbullying can mean sending threatening texts , harassing someone in a public forum ( such as Facebook ) , hacking someone ’ s account and pretending to be him or her , posting embarrassing images online , and so on . A study by the Cyberbullying Research Center found that 20 percent of middle school students admitted to “ seriously thinking about committing suicide ” as a result of online bullying ( Hinduja and Patchin 2010 ) . Whereas bullying face-to-face requires willingness to interact with your victim , cyberbullying allows bullies to harass others from the privacy of their homes without witnessing the damage firsthand . This form of bullying is particularly dangerous because it ’ s widely accessible and therefore easier to accomplish .",0.9291017055511475,1.0

13,"At first , the writers ’ forum was clearly a secondary group united by the members ’ professions and work situations . As Levy explained , “ On the internet , you can be present or absent as often as you want . No one is expecting you to show up . ” It was a useful place to research information about different publishers and about who had recently sold what , and to track industry trends . But as time passed , Levy found it served a different purpose . Since the group shared other characteristics beyond their writing ( such as age and gender ) , the online conversation naturally turned to matters such as child-rearing , aging parents , health , and exercise . Levy found it was a sympathetic place to talk about any number of subjects , not just writing . Further , when people didn ’ t post for several days , others expressed concern , asking whether anyone had heard from the missing writers . It reached a point where most members would tell the group if they were traveling or needed to be offline for awhile . The group continued to share . One member on the site who was going through a difficult family illness wrote , “ I don ’ t know where I ’ d be without you women .

13,"A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction , such as a nuclear family , a dyad , or a triad . Georg Simmel ( 1858 – 1915 ) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad , or two-member group , and a triad , which is a three-member group ( Simmel 1902 ) . In the former , if one person withdraws , the group can no longer exist . One can think of a divorce , which effectively ends the “ group ” of the married couple , or of two best friends never speaking again . In a triad , however , the dynamic is quite different . If one person withdraws , the group lives on . A triad has a different set of relationships . If there are three in the group , two-against-one dynamics can develop and there exists the potential for a majority opinion on any issue . Small groups generally have strong internal cohesiveness and a sense of connection . The challenge , however , is for small groups to achieve large goals . They can struggle to be heard or to be a force for change if they are pushing against larger groups . In short , they are easier to ignore . It is difficult to define exactly when a small group becomes a large group . One step might be when there are too many people to join in a simultaneous discussion . Another might be when a group joins with other groups as part of a movement that unites them . These larger groups may share a geographic space , such as a fraternity or sorority on the same campus , or they might be spread out around the globe . The larger the group , the more attention it can garner , and the more pressure members can put toward whatever goal they wish to achieve . At the same time , the larger the group becomes , the more the risk grows for division and lack of cohesion .",0.9945206642150879,1.0

However , there is little clear evidence that one branch of government is more efficient than another . The real challenge is weighing the benefits of regulation against the costs , and finding the right balance between over - and under-regulation . Weak regulation can allow a business to cut corners . For instance , auto emission regulations intended to go into effect by certain dates have been delayed multiple times during the 1980s and the early 2000s . The Obama administration announced plans to enforce tougher rules , but the current administration has said it plans to delay implementation . Auto emission regulations have become politically charged , constantly changing depending on the party in power , and some states have responded with their own legislation instead of waiting for the federal stalemate to end . Regulation that is consistently enforced in the effort to achieve the long-term goal , such as cleaner air , is preferable to a moving target .",0.9282341599464417,1.0

A fiduciary duty is a very high level of legal responsibility owed by those who manage someone else ’ s money , which includes the duties of care and loyalty . Some examples of relationships that include a fiduciary duty are those between a trustee of an estate and its beneficiary , and between a fund manager and a client .

The protective shield of corporate status enables businesses to socialize their losses in a way that traditional proprietorships and partnerships are not able to do . Socializing a loss is a means to amortize it or spread it out over society in general , so the owners do not absorb it individually . Amortization is similar to the idea behind insurance , in which many people bear a small share in a loss , rather than one or a few people bearing all of it . Therefore , it is accurate to say that society enables corporations to exist , both by passing laws that create them and by limiting the financial risk exposure of their owners . Since our society grants for-profit businesses the right to incorporate and make unlimited profits with limited liability , a reasonable person could conclude that corporations owe a debt to society in return .

The drilling operation failed and ultimately led to an infamous environmental and human disaster called the Deepwater Horizon spill that has since been the subject of intense scrutiny and litigation . 68 Eleven workers were killed and seventeen were injured , and at least five million barrels of oil poured into the ocean in the largest such spill in history . The environmental harm was epic in scale ( Figure 4.11 ) . Five years later , tar balls still dotted the beach . Oil buried beneath the sand offshore still gets pushed toward the beach whenever the surf is rough . Offshore islands have disappeared because the mangrove roots were coated in oil , killing the trees . Once the mangrove root framework that holds the land together was destroyed , the islands were washed away within a few years . Louisiana was already losing land at a concerning pace , and more has been lost since the spill .

Managers are usually accorded significant latitude as long as they can point to a rational interpretation of their actions as benefiting the corporation as a whole in the long term . The combination of economic and political power in the world ’ s largest corporations necessitates that executives consider the interests of a broader set of stakeholders , rather than only stockholders .

More Americans under the age of thirty now identify themselves as Independents instead of Democrats or Republicans ( Figure 1.15 ) . Instead of identifying with a particular political party , young Americans are increasingly concerned about specific issues , such as same-sex marriage . 27 People whose votes are determined based on single issues are unlikely to vote according to party affiliation . The other factor involved in low youth voter turnout in the past was that younger Americans did not feel that candidates generally tackle issues relevant to their lives . When younger voters cannot relate to the issues put forth in a campaign , such as entitlements for seniors , they lose interest . This dynamic changed somewhat in 2016 as Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders made college costs an issue , even promising free college tuition for undergraduates at public institutions . Senator Sanders enjoyed intense support on college campuses across the United States . After his nomination campaign failed , this young voter enthusiasm faded .

When elected officials ignore all factors other than their party ’ s position on a particular issue , some voters become disheartened while others may become polarized .

Unfortunately , public opinion polls , which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues , capture only people ’ s latent preferences or beliefs . Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time . They may not even represent a person ’ s true feelings , since they may be formed on the spot when someone is asked a question about which he or she has no real opinion . Indeed , voting itself may reflect merely a latent preference because even people who do not feel strongly about a particular political candidate or issue vote .

15,"Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems . This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems . For example , the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics , self-government , and natural rights . At this time , the idea of liberty became an important concept . According to John Locke , an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century , all people have natural rights to life , liberty , and property . From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed . In the eighteenth century , in Great Britain ’ s North American colonies , and later in France , this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king ; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them .",0.771070122718811,0.0

In socialist societies , the means of generating wealth , such as factories , large farms , and banks , are owned by the government and not by private individuals . The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens , primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care , education , and childcare . In socialist countries , the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity , transportation systems like airlines and railroads , and telecommunications systems . In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy : only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government .

15,"Since its founding , the United States has relied on citizen participation to govern at the local , state , and national levels . This civic engagement ensures that representative democracy will continue to flourish and that people will continue to influence government . The right of citizens to participate in government is an important feature of democracy , and over the centuries many have fought to acquire and defend this right . During the American Revolution ( 1775 – 1783 ) , British colonists fought for the right to govern themselves . In the early nineteenth century , agitated citizens called for the removal of property requirements for voting so poor white men could participate in government just as wealthy men could . Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries , women , African Americans , Native Americans , and many other groups fought for the right to vote and hold office . The poster shown above ( Figure 1.1 ) , created during World War II , depicts voting as an important part of the fight to keep the United States free . The purpose of voting and other forms of political engagement is to ensure that government serves the people , and not the other way around . But what does government do to serve the people ? What different forms of government exist ? How do they differ ? How can citizens best engage with and participate in the crucial process of governing the nation ? This chapter seeks to answer these questions .",0.8108877539634705,0.0

Children of all religions , races and ethnicities , socioeconomic classes , and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade . It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation ’ s children . Private schools do provide some education in the United States ; however , they charge tuition , and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees ( or whose children gain a scholarship ) can attend these institutions . Some schools charge very high tuition , the equivalent to the tuition at a private college . If private schools were the only educational institutions , most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated . Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good . Toll goods are available to many people , and many people can make use of them , but only if they can pay the price . They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods . All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States . They can choose to send their children to a private school , but the private school will charge them . On the other hand , public schools , which are operated by the government , provide free education so all children can attend school . Therefore , everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system .

Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market . In this way , businesses would reap profits , consumers would have their needs satisfied , and society as a whole would prosper .

For example , in the United States , it is legal for women to have abortions . Many people oppose this right , primarily for religious reasons , and often protest outside facilities that provide abortions . In 2007 , the state of Massachusetts enacted a law that required protestors to stand thirty-five feet away from clinic entrances . The intention was to prevent women seeking abortions from being harassed or threatened with violence . Groups favoring the protection of women ’ s reproductive rights supported the law . Groups opposed to abortion argued that the buffer zone prevented them from speaking to women to try to persuade them not to have the procedure done . In 2014 , in the case of McCullen v .

These goods and services are known as private goods . 1 People can purchase what they need in the quantity in which they need it . This , of course , is the ideal . In reality , those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs , or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality .

Among members of the House of Representatives , 93 percent have a bachelor ’ s degree , as do 99 percent of members of the Senate . 8 Fewer than 40 percent of U . S . adults have even an associate ’ s degree . 9 The majority of the men and women in Congress also engaged in either state or local politics , were business people , or practiced law before being elected to Congress . 10 Approximately 80 percent of both the Senate and the House of Representatives are male , and about 21 percent of members of Congress are people of color ( Figure 1.8 ) . The nation ’ s laws are made primarily by well-educated white male professionals and businessmen . The makeup of Congress is important because race , sex , profession , education , and socioeconomic class have an important effect on people ’ s political interests . For example , changes in the way taxes are levied and spent do not affect all citizens equally . A flat tax , which generally requires that everyone pay the same percentage rate , hurts the poor more than it does the rich . If the income tax rate was flat at 10 percent , all Americans would have to pay 10 percent of their income to the federal government . Someone who made $ 40,000 a year would have to pay $ 4,000 and be left with only $ 36,000 to live on . Someone who made $ 1,000 , 000 would have to pay $ 100,000 , a greater sum , but he or she would still be left with $ 900,000 . People who were not wealthy would probably pay more than they could comfortably afford , while the wealthy , who could afford to pay more and still live well , would not see a real impact on their daily lives . Similarly , the allocation of revenue affects the rich and the poor differently . Giving more money to public education does not benefit the wealthy as much as it does the poor , because the wealthy are more likely than the poor to send their children to private schools or to at least have the option of doing so . However , better funded public schools have the potential to greatly improve the upward mobility of members of other socioeconomic classes who have no other option than to send their children to public schools .",0.48878997564315796,0.0

Others represent the interests of those who oppose any restrictions on the number or type of weapons Americans may own . So far , state governments have attempted to balance the interests of both groups by placing restrictions on such things as who can sell guns , where gun sales may take place , or requirements for background checks , but they have not attempted to ban gun sales altogether .

Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all , this has not necessarily been the case . Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses , industries , and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations . In turn , great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government — a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population , which will be discussed later .",0.44761964678764343,0.0

Overall , only 10 percent of the American population does so . 12 Therefore , a Congress dominated by millionaires who send their children to private schools is more likely to believe that flat taxes are fair and that increased funding for public education is not a necessity . Their experience , however , does not reflect the experience of average Americans . Pluralist theory rejects this approach , arguing that although there are elite members of society they do not control government . Instead , pluralists argue , political power is distributed throughout society . Rather than resting in the hands of individuals , a variety of organized groups hold power , with some groups having more influence on certain issues than others .

15,"Civic engagement can increase the power of ordinary people to influence government actions . Even those without money or connections to important people can influence the policies that affect their lives and change the direction taken by government . U . S . history is filled with examples of people actively challenging the power of elites , gaining rights for themselves , and protecting their interests . For example , slavery was once legal in the United States and large sectors of the U . S . economy were dependent on this forced labor . Slavery was outlawed and blacks were granted citizenship because of the actions of abolitionists . Although some abolitionists were wealthy white men , most were ordinary people , including men and women of both races . White women and blacks were able to actively assist in the campaign to end slavery despite the fact that , with few exceptions , they were unable to vote . Similarly , the right to vote once belonged solely to white men until the Fifteenth Amendment gave the vote to African American men . The Nineteenth Amendment extended the vote to include women , and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made exercising the right to vote a reality for African American men and women in the South . None of this would have happened , however , without the efforts of people who marched in protest , participated in boycotts , delivered speeches , wrote letters to politicians , and sometimes risked arrest in order to be heard ( Figure 1.10 ) . The tactics used to influence the government and effect change by abolitionists and members of the women ’ s rights and African American civil rights movements are still used by many activists today .",0.9540063738822937,0.0

15,"Besides providing stability and goods and services for all , government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people . In the United States , people elect representatives to city councils , state legislatures , and Congress . These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions . They also pass measures to raise money , through the imposition of taxes on such things as income , property , and sales . Local , state , and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services . On the local level , funds are allotted for education , police and fire departments , and maintenance of public parks . State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities , maintenance of state roads and bridges , and wildlife management , among other priorities . On the national level , money goes to such things as defense , Social Security , pensions for veterans , maintenance of federal courts and prisons , and management of national parks . At each level , representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent .

15,"As noted earlier , politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue . Put more simply , politics is the process of who gets what and how . Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not . If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism , it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business . If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism , which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities , it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education , public transportation , housing for the poor , and care for the elderly . If , for example , the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty , it may authorize the tapping of people ’ s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish . If liberty is more important , then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens ’ private communications . The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer .",1.0106024742126465,0.0

15,"Are fewer people today active in politics than in the past ? Political scientist Robert Putnam has argued that civic engagement is declining ; although many Americans may report belonging to groups , these groups are usually large , impersonal ones with thousands of members . People who join groups such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace may share certain values and ideals with other members of the group , but they do not actually interact with these other members . These organizations are different from the types of groups Americans used to belong to , like church groups or bowling leagues . Although people are still interested in volunteering and working for the public good , they are more interested in either working individually or joining large organizations where they have little opportunity to interact with others . Putnam considers a number of explanations for this decline in small group membership , including increased participation by women in the workforce , a decrease in the number of marriages and an increase in divorces , and the effect of technological developments , such as the internet , that separate people by allowing them to feel connected to others without having to spend time in their presence . 19 Putnam argues that a decline in social capital — “ the collective value of all ‘ social networks ’ [ those whom people know ] and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other ” — accompanies this decline in membership in small , interactive groups . 20 Included in social capital are such things as networks of individuals , a sense that one is part of an entity larger than oneself , concern for the collective good and a willingness to help others , and the ability to trust others and to work with them to find solutions to problems . This , in turn , has hurt people ’ s willingness and ability to engage in representative government . If Putnam is correct , this trend is unfortunate , because becoming active in government and community organizations is important for many reasons .",0.9236003756523132,0.0

For instance , an action that will meet the needs of large numbers of people may not be favored by the elite members of society . Giving the elite what they want may interfere with plans to help the poor . As pluralists argue , public policy is created as a result of competition among groups .

15,"According to pluralist theory , people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their desires known to politicians . These groups include such entities as environmental advocates , unions , and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses . Because most people lack the inclination , time , or expertise necessary to decide political issues , these groups will speak for them . As groups compete with one another and find themselves in conflict regarding important issues , government policy begins to take shape . In this way , government policy is shaped from the bottom up and not from the top down , as we see in elitist theory . Robert Dahl , author of Who Governs ? , was one of the first to advance the pluralist theory , and argued that politicians seeking an “ electoral payoff ” are attentive to the concerns of politically active citizens and , through them , become acquainted with the needs of ordinary people . They will attempt to give people what they want in exchange for their votes . 15",1.0167206525802612,1.0

16,"The respiratory system contributes to the balance of acids and bases in the body by regulating the blood levels of carbonic acid ( Figure 26.16 ) . CO 2 in the blood readily reacts with water to form carbonic acid , and the levels of CO 2 and carbonic acid in the blood are in equilibrium . When the CO 2 level in the blood rises ( as it does when you hold your breath ) , the excess CO 2 reacts with water to form additional carbonic acid , lowering blood pH . Increasing the rate and / or depth of respiration ( which you might feel the “ urge ” to do after holding your breath ) allows you to exhale more CO 2 . The loss of CO 2 from the body reduces blood levels of carbonic acid and thereby adjusts the pH upward , toward normal levels . As you might have surmised , this process also works in the opposite direction . Excessive deep and rapid breathing ( as in hyperventilation ) rids the blood of CO 2 and reduces the level of carbonic acid , making the blood too alkaline . This brief alkalosis can be remedied by rebreathing air that has been exhaled into a paper bag . Rebreathing exhaled air will rapidly bring blood pH down toward normal . The chemical reactions that regulate the levels of CO 2 and carbonic acid occur in the lungs when blood travels through the lung ’ s pulmonary capillaries . Minor adjustments in breathing are usually sufficient to adjust the pH of the blood by changing how much CO 2 is exhaled . In fact , doubling the respiratory rate for less than 1 minute , removing “ extra ” CO 2 , would increase the blood pH by 0.2 . This situation is common if you are exercising strenuously over a period of time . To keep up the necessary energy production , you would produce excess CO 2 ( and lactic acid if exercising beyond your aerobic threshold ) . In order to balance the increased acid production , the respiration rate goes up to remove the CO 2 . This helps to keep you from developing acidosis .",0.9821591377258301,0.0

In the human body , the substances that participate in chemical reactions must remain within narrows ranges of concentration . Too much or too little of a single substance can disrupt your bodily functions . Because metabolism relies on reactions that are all interconnected , any disruption might affect multiple organs or even organ systems . Water is the most ubiquitous substance in the chemical reactions of life . The interactions of various aqueous solutions — solutions in which water is the solvent — are continuously monitored and adjusted by a large suite of interconnected feedback systems in your body . Understanding the ways in which the body maintains these critical balances is key to understanding good health .",0.9778172373771667,0.0

16,"Drinking water is considered voluntary . So how is water intake regulated by the body ? Consider someone who is experiencing dehydration , a net loss of water that results in insufficient water in blood and other tissues . The water that leaves the body , as exhaled air , sweat , or urine , is ultimately extracted from blood plasma . As the blood becomes more concentrated , the thirst response — a sequence of physiological processes — is triggered ( Figure 26.10 ) . Osmoreceptors are sensory receptors in the thirst center in the hypothalamus that monitor the concentration of solutes ( osmolality ) of the blood . If blood osmolality increases above its ideal value , the hypothalamus transmits signals that result in a conscious awareness of thirst . The person should ( and normally does ) respond by drinking water . The hypothalamus of a dehydrated person also releases antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) through the posterior pituitary gland . ADH signals the kidneys to recover water from urine , effectively diluting the blood plasma . To conserve water , the hypothalamus of a dehydrated person also sends signals via the sympathetic nervous system to the salivary glands in the mouth . The signals result in a decrease in watery , serous output ( and an increase in stickier , thicker mucus output ) . These changes in secretions result in a “ dry mouth ” and the sensation of thirst . Decreased blood volume resulting from water loss has two additional effects . First , baroreceptors , blood-pressure receptors in the arch of the aorta and the carotid arteries in the neck , detect a decrease in blood pressure that results from decreased blood volume . The heart is ultimately signaled to increase its rate and / or strength of contractions to compensate for the lowered blood pressure .",0.9927681088447571,0.0

When certain tissues in the body cannot get adequate amounts of glucose , they depend on the breakdown of fatty acids for energy . When acetyl groups break off the fatty acid chains , the acetyl groups then non-enzymatically combine to form ketone bodies , acetoacetic acid , beta-hydroxybutyric acid , and acetone , all of which increase the acidity of the blood . In this condition , the brain isn ’ t supplied with enough of its fuel — glucose — to produce all of the ATP it requires to function . Ketoacidosis can be severe and , if not detected and treated properly , can lead to diabetic coma , which can be fatal . A common early symptom of ketoacidosis is deep , rapid breathing as the body attempts to drive off CO 2 and compensate for the acidosis . Another common symptom is fruity-smelling breath , due to the exhalation of acetone . Other symptoms include dry skin and mouth , a flushed face , nausea , vomiting , and stomach pain .

Bicarbonate ions and carbonic acid are present in the blood in a 20:1 ratio if the blood pH is within the normal range . With 20 times more bicarbonate than carbonic acid , this capture system is most efficient at buffering changes that would make the blood more acidic . This is useful because most of the body ’ s metabolic wastes , such as lactic acid and ketone bodies , are acids . Carbonic acid levels in the blood are controlled by the expiration of CO 2 through the lungs . In red blood cells , carbonic anhydrase forces the dissociation of the acid , rendering the blood less acidic . Because of this acid dissociation , CO 2 is exhaled ( see equations above ) . The level of bicarbonate in the blood is controlled through the renal system , where bicarbonate ions in the renal filtrate are conserved and passed back into the blood . However , the bicarbonate buffer is the primary buffering system of the IF surrounding the cells in tissues throughout the body .",1.001856803894043,1.0
16,"Antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) , also known as vasopressin , controls the amount of water reabsorbed from the collecting ducts and tubules in the kidney . This hormone is produced in the hypothalamus and is delivered to the posterior pituitary for storage and release ( Figure 26.11 ) . When the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus detect an increase in the concentration of blood plasma , the hypothalamus signals the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary into the blood .",0.9919847846031189,0.0

Teeth also have a high concentration of calcium within them . A little more than one-half of blood calcium is bound to proteins , leaving the rest in its ionized form . Calcium ions , Ca 2 + , are necessary for muscle contraction , enzyme activity , and blood coagulation . In addition , calcium helps to stabilize cell membranes and is essential for the release of neurotransmitters from neurons and of hormones from endocrine glands .",0.3232503831386566,1.0
16,"ADH has two major effects . It constricts the arterioles in the peripheral circulation , which reduces the flow of blood to the extremities and thereby increases the blood supply to the core of the body . ADH also causes the epithelial cells that line the renal collecting tubules to move water channel proteins , called aquaporins , from the interior of the cells to the apical surface , where these proteins are inserted into the cell membrane ( Figure 26.12 ) . The result is an increase in the water permeability of these cells and , thus , a large increase in water passage from the urine through the walls of the collecting tubules , leading to more reabsorption of water into the bloodstream . When the blood plasma becomes less concentrated and the level of ADH decreases , aquaporins are removed from collecting tubule cell membranes , and the passage of water out of urine and into the blood decreases .",0.8792642951011658,0.0

Cushing ’ s disease , which is the chronic hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) by the anterior pituitary gland , can cause chronic metabolic alkalosis . The oversecretion of ACTH results in elevated aldosterone levels and an increased loss of potassium by urinary excretion .

16,"A relative decrease in blood sodium can occur because of an imbalance of sodium in one of the body ’ s other fluid compartments , like IF , or from a dilution of sodium due to water retention related to edema or congestive heart failure . At the cellular level , hyponatremia results in increased entry of water into cells by osmosis , because the concentration of solutes within the cell exceeds the concentration of solutes in the now-diluted ECF . The excess water causes swelling of the cells ; the swelling of red blood cells — decreasing their oxygen-carrying efficiency and making them potentially too large to fit through capillaries — along with the swelling of neurons in the brain can result in brain damage or even death .",0.80461585521698,0.0

17,"White southerners reacted with outrage at the changes imposed upon them . The sight of once-enslaved Blacks serving in positions of authority as sheriffs , congressmen , and city council members stimulated great resentment at the process of Reconstruction and its undermining of the traditional social and economic foundations of the South . Indignant southerners referred to this period of reform as a time of “ negro misrule . ” They complained of profligate corruption on the part of vengeful freed people and greedy northerners looking to fill their pockets with the South ’ s riches . Unfortunately for the great many honest reformers , southerners did have a handful of real examples of corruption they could point to , such as legislators using state revenues to buy hams and perfumes or giving themselves inflated salaries . Such examples , however , were relatively few and largely comparable to nineteenth-century corruption across the country . Yet these powerful stories , combined with deep-seated racial animosity toward Blacks in the South , led to Democratic campaigns to “ redeem ” state governments . Democrats across the South leveraged planters ’ economic power and wielded White vigilante violence to ultimately take back state political power from the Republicans . By the time President Grant ’ s attentions were being directed away from the South and toward the Indian Wars in the West in 1876 , power in the South had largely been returned to Whites and Reconstruction was effectively abandoned . By the end of 1876 , only South Carolina , Louisiana , and Florida still had Republican governments .",0.0925392284989357,0.0

Many White southerners felt humiliated by the process of Radical Reconstruction and the way Republicans had upended southern society , placing Black people in positions of authority while taxing large landowners to pay for the education of formerly enslaved people . Those committed to rolling back the tide of Radical Reconstruction in the South called themselves redeemers , a label that expressed their desire to redeem their states from northern control and to restore the antebellum social order whereby Blacks were kept safely under the boot heel of Whites . They represented the Democratic Party in the South and worked tirelessly to end what they saw as an era of “ negro misrule . ” By 1877 , they had succeeded in bringing about the “ redemption ” of the South , effectively destroying the dream of Radical Reconstruction .",0.9623091220855713,1.0
17,"While the Fifteenth Amendment may have been greeted with applause in many corners , leading women ’ s rights activists , who had been campaigning for decades for the right to vote , saw it as a major disappointment . More dispiriting still was the fact that many women ’ s rights activists , such as Susan B . Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , had played a large part in the abolitionist movement leading up to the Civil War . Following the war , women and men , White and Black , formed the American Equal Rights Association ( AERA ) for the expressed purpose of securing “ equal Rights to all American citizens , especially the right of suffrage , irrespective of race , color or sex . ” Two years later , with the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment , section 2 of which specifically qualified the liberties it extended to “ male citizens , ” it seemed as though the progress made in support of civil rights was not only passing women by but was purposely codifying their exclusion . As Congress debated the language of the Fifteenth Amendment , some held out hope that it would finally extend the franchise to women . Those hopes were dashed when Congress adopted the final language .",0.7375635504722595,0.0

17,"Unexpectedly elevated to the presidency in 1865 , this formerly impoverished tailor ’ s apprentice and unwavering antagonist of the wealthy southern planter class now found himself tasked with administering the restoration of a destroyed South . Lincoln ’ s position as president had been that the secession of the Southern states was never legal ; that is , they had not succeeded in leaving the Union , therefore they still had certain rights to self-government as states . In keeping with Lincoln ’ s plan , Johnson desired to quickly reincorporate the South back into the Union on lenient terms and heal the wounds of the nation . This position angered many in his own party . The northern Radical Republican plan for Reconstruction looked to overturn southern society and specifically aimed at ending the plantation system . President Johnson quickly disappointed Radical Republicans when he rejected their idea that the federal government could provide voting rights for freed slaves .

Under the system , freed people rented the land they worked , often on the same plantations where they had been enslaved . Some landless Whites also became sharecroppers . Sharecroppers paid their landlords with the crops they grew , often as much as half their harvest . Sharecropping favored the landlords and ensured that freed people could not attain independent livelihoods . The year-to-year leases meant no incentive existed to substantially improve the land , and high interest payments siphoned additional money away from the farmers . Sharecroppers often became trapped in a never-ending cycle of debt , unable to buy their own land and unable to stop working for their creditor because of what they owed . The consequences of sharecropping affected the entire South for many generations , severely limiting economic development and ensuring that the South remained an agricultural backwater .",1.0153886079788208,0.0

The South during the early 1870s brimmed with formerly enslaved and freeborn Black people serving as school board commissioners , county commissioners , clerks of court , board of education and city council members , justices of the peace , constables , coroners , magistrates , sheriffs , auditors , and registrars . This wave of local African American political activity contributed to and was accompanied by a new concern for the poor and disadvantaged in the South .

In the winter of 1869 , Republicans introduced another constitutional amendment , the third of the Reconstruction era . When Republicans had passed the Fourteenth Amendment , which addressed citizenship rights and equal protections , they were unable to explicitly ban states from withholding the franchise based on race . With the Fifteenth Amendment , they sought to correct this major weakness by finally extending to Black men the right to vote . The amendment directed that “ [ t ] he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . ” Unfortunately , the new amendment had weaknesses of its own . As part of a compromise to ensure the passage of the amendment with the broadest possible support , drafters of the amendment specifically excluded language that addressed literacy tests and poll taxes , the most common ways Blacks were traditionally disenfranchised in both the North and the South . Indeed , Radical Republican leader Charles Sumner of Massachusetts , himself an ardent supporter of legal equality without exception to race , refused to vote for the amendment precisely because it did not address these obvious loopholes .",0.9982050061225891,1.0

The reality is that the opposite was true . White southerners orchestrated a sometimes violent and generally successful counterrevolution against Reconstruction policies in the South beginning in the 1860s . Those who worked to change and modernize the South typically did so under the stern gaze of exasperated Whites and threats of violence . Black Republican officials in the South were frequently terrorized , assaulted , and even murdered with impunity by organizations like the Ku Klux Klan . When not ignoring the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments altogether , White leaders often used trickery and fraud at the polls to get the results they wanted .

Congress renewed the bureau ’ s charter in 1866 , but President Johnson , who steadfastly believed that the work of restoring the Union had been completed , vetoed the re-chartering . Radical Republicans continued to support the bureau , igniting a contest between Congress and the president that intensified during the next several years .

Johnson felt that ending slavery went far enough ; extending the rights and protections of citizenship to freed people , he believed , went much too far . He continued to believe that Blacks were inferior to Whites . The president ’ s “ swing around the circle ” speeches to gain support for his program and derail the Radical Republicans proved to be a disaster , as hecklers provoked Johnson to make damaging statements .

17,"Lincoln ’ s assassination elevated Vice President Andrew Johnson , a Democrat , to the presidency . Johnson had come from very humble origins . Born into extreme poverty in North Carolina and having never attended school , Johnson was the picture of a self-made man . His wife had taught him how to read and he had worked as a tailor , a trade he had been apprenticed to as a child . In Tennessee , where he had moved as a young man , he gradually rose up the political ladder , earning a reputation for being a skillful stump speaker and a staunch defender of poor southerners . He was elected to serve in the House of Representatives in the 1840s , became governor of Tennessee the following decade , and then was elected a U . S . senator just a few years before the country descended into war . When Tennessee seceded , Johnson remained loyal to the Union and stayed in the Senate . As Union troops marched on his home state of North Carolina , Lincoln appointed him governor of the then-occupied state of Tennessee , where he served until being nominated by the Republicans to run for vice president on a Lincoln ticket . The nomination of Johnson , a Democrat and a slaveholding southerner , was a pragmatic decision made by concerned Republicans . It was important for them to show that the party supported all loyal men , regardless of their origin or political persuasion . Johnson appeared an ideal choice , because his nomination would bring with it the support of both pro-Southern elements and the War Democrats who rejected the conciliatory stance of the Copperheads , the northern Democrats who opposed the Civil War .",0.3197306990623474,0.0

Perhaps most important , all remaining federal troops would be withdrawn from the South , a move that effectively ended Reconstruction . Hayes believed that southern leaders would obey and enforce the Reconstruction-era constitutional amendments that protected the rights of freed people .

17,"In fact , President Johnson ’ s Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction in May 1865 provided sweeping “ amnesty and pardon ” to rebellious Southerners . It returned to them their property , with the notable exception of the people they had enslaved , and it asked only that they affirm their support for the Constitution of the United States . Those Southerners exempted from this amnesty included the Confederate political leadership , high-ranking military officers , and persons with taxable property worth more than $ 20,000 . The inclusion of this last category was specifically designed to make it clear to the southern planter class that they had a unique responsibility for the outbreak of hostilities . But it also satisfied Johnson ’ s desire to exact vengeance on a class of people he had fought politically for much of his life . For this class of wealthy Southerners to regain their rights , they would have to swallow their pride and request a personal pardon from Johnson himself . For the Southern states , the requirements for readmission to the Union were also fairly straightforward . States were required to hold individual state conventions where they would repeal the ordinances of secession and ratify the Thirteenth Amendment . By the end of 1865 , a number of former Confederate leaders were in the Union capital looking to claim their seats in Congress . Among them was Alexander Stephens , the vice president of the Confederacy , who had spent several months in a Boston jail after the war .

To maintain agricultural production , the South had relied on the enslaved to work the land . Now the region was faced with the daunting prospect of making the transition from a slave economy to one where labor was purchased on the open market . Not surprisingly , planters in the southern states were reluctant to make such a transition .

18,"While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes , neurons are broadly divided into four basic types : unipolar , bipolar , multipolar , and pseudounipolar . Figure 35.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types . Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma . These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands . A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma . An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell , which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain . Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron . Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites . Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) . An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum , which has many branching dendrites but only one axon . Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells . A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma , like a unipolar cell , but this process later branches into two distinct structures , like a bipolar cell . Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions : one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord .",1.0040068626403809,1.0

Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral ( toward the bottom ) spinal cord , as shown in Figure 35.27 .

18,"There are several different types of glia with different functions , two of which are shown in Figure 35.7 . Astrocytes , shown in Figure 35.8 a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS . They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons , regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid , and provide structural support for synapses . Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier — a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain . Astrocytes , in particular , have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity , transmit calcium waves between astrocytes , and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses . Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS . Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms . Oligodendrocytes , shown in Figure 35.8 b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS . One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons . This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon . Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations . Ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord . They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid , which serves as a cushion for the brain , moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain , and is a component for the choroid plexus . 35.2 How Neurons Communicate Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9928622841835022,1.0
18,"There are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses . Because chemical synapses depend on the release of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal , there is an approximately one millisecond delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion channels . Additionally , this signaling is unidirectional . Signaling in electrical synapses , in contrast , is virtually instantaneous ( which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes ) , and some electrical synapses are bidirectional . Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked , and they are important for synchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons . For example , electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep , and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures .",0.3579898774623871,0.0

18,"The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels , in this case ligand-gated channels , on the postsynaptic membrane to open . Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane , as detailed in Table 35.1 . For example , when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle ( called the neuromuscular junction ) by a presynaptic neuron , it causes postsynaptic Na + channels to open . Na + enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize . This depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential . Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ( IPSPs ) , a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane . For example , when the neurotransmitter GABA ( gamma-aminobutyric acid ) is released from a presynaptic neuron , it binds to and opens Cl - channels . Cl - ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane , making the neuron less likely to fire an action potential .",0.6436545252799988,0.0

18,"Signal Summation Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron , but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential . This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock , as illustrated in Figure 35.16 . Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa . It is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential . Together , synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “ noise ” in the system is not transmitted as important information .",0.9707688093185425,1.0

18,"Schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States . Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination , inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses , difficulty thinking , and problems with social situations . People with schizophrenia can suffer from hallucinations and hear voices ; they may also suffer from delusions . Patients also have so-called “ negative ” symptoms like a flattened emotional state , loss of pleasure , and loss of basic drives . Many schizophrenic patients are diagnosed in their late adolescence or early 20s . The development of schizophrenia is thought to involve malfunctioning dopaminergic neurons and may also involve problems with glutamate signaling . Treatment for the disease usually requires antipsychotic medications that work by blocking dopamine receptors and decreasing dopamine neurotransmission in the brain . This decrease in dopamine can cause Parkinson ’ s disease-like symptoms in some patients . While some classes of antipsychotics can be quite effective at treating the disease , they are not a cure , and most patients must remain medicated for the rest of their lives .",0.1954151690006256,0.0

18,"Resting Membrane Potential A neuron at rest is negatively charged : the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside ( − 70 mV , note that this number varies by neuron type and by species ) . This voltage is called the resting membrane potential ; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell . If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions , each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium . Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will , there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell , as shown in Table 35.1 . The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions ( K + ) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential ( Figure 35.10 ) . When the membrane is at rest , K + ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the concentration gradient . The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell ( in the extracellular fluid ) relative to inside the cell ( in the cytoplasm ) . The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement . In neurons , potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell . The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient . However , the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels . Therefore , potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in . Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering , this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell . The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential , once established . Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K + ions into the cell while removing three Na + ions per ATP consumed . As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in , the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid . It should be noted that chloride ions ( Cl – ) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm .",0.9051044583320618,1.0

18,"Once neurotransmission has occurred , the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic membrane can “ reset ” and be ready to receive another signal . This can be accomplished in three ways : the neurotransmitter can diffuse away from the synaptic cleft , it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft , or it can be recycled ( sometimes called reuptake ) by the presynaptic neuron . Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission . For example , some drugs that are given to Alzheimer ’ s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase , the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine . This inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine . Once released , the acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors .",0.5202242136001587,0.0
18,"Once a signal is received by the dendrite , it then travels passively to the cell body . The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon . An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals . These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons , muscle , or target organs . Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells . Neurons usually have one or two axons , but some neurons , like amacrine cells in the retina , do not contain any axons . Some axons are covered with myelin , which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon , greatly increasing the speed on conduction . This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter — from the base of the spine to the toes . The myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron . Myelin is produced by glial cells . Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath . These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “ recharged ” as it travels along the axon .",0.9409341216087341,1.0

18,"Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord , as illustrated in Figure 35.27 . The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia ( the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord ) . The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons . Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs . As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test , speech , or athletic event can attest , the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive . This is both because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons , amplifying the effect of the original synapse , and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine ( and the closely related hormone epinephrine ) into the blood stream . The physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi ( making it easier for the animal to breathe ) , increasing heart rate , and moving blood from the skin to the heart , muscles , and brain ( so the animal can think and run ) . The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger , and scientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTP — allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and avoid it in the future .",0.9913889765739441,1.0

18,"Major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders . To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder , a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed , changes in appetite and sleep schedules , difficulty concentrating , feelings of worthlessness , and suicidal thoughts . The exact causes of major depression are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental risk factors . Some research supports the “ classic monoamine hypothesis , ” which suggests that depression is caused by a decrease in norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission . One argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some antidepressant medications cause an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning treatment — but clinical results of these medications are not seen until weeks later . This has led to alternative hypotheses : for example , dopamine may also be decreased in depressed patients , or it may actually be an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin that causes the disease , and antidepressants force a feedback loop that decreases this release . Treatments for depression include psychotherapy , electroconvulsive therapy , deep-brain stimulation , and prescription medications . There are several classes of antidepressant medications that work through different mechanisms . For example , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAO inhibitors ) block the enzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters ( including dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine ) , resulting in increased neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron . This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft . Other types of drugs such as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat depression .",0.9087002277374268,0.0
18,"Long-term potentiation ( LTP ) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection . LTP is based on the Hebbian principle : cells that fire together wire together . There are various mechanisms , none fully understood , behind the synaptic strengthening seen with LTP . One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor , called NMDA ( N-Methyl-D-aspartate ) receptors , shown in Figure 35.18 . These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions ; however , when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession ( either from one neuron or multiple neurons ) , the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell . Next , Ca 2 + ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor , called AMPA ( α-amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazolepropionic acid ) receptors , to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane , since activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell . So , the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane , it will have a larger excitatory effect ( EPSP ) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell . The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release . Some drugs of abuse co-opt the LTP pathway , and this synaptic strengthening can lead to addiction .",0.9799362421035767,0.0
18,"Long-term depression ( LTD ) is essentially the reverse of LTP : it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection . One mechanism known to cause LTD also involves AMPA receptors . In this situation , calcium that enters through NMDA receptors initiates a different signaling cascade , which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane , as illustrated in Figure 35.18 . The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron . While it may seem counterintuitive , LTD may be just as important for learning and memory as LTP . The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison . 35.3 The Central Nervous System Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9853001832962036,0.0

Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves do not regenerate , although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves . Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury . One such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia .

18,"For an action potential to communicate information to another neuron , it must travel along the axon and reach the axon terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release . The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon ’ s resistance to current leak . Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon ; this increases the speed of action potential conduction . In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis , action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas . The nodes of Ranvier , illustrated in Figure 35.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon . These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na + and K + channels . Flow of ions through these channels , particularly the Na + channels , regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon . This ‘ jumping ’ of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction . If nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon , the action potential would propagate very slowly since Na + and K + channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points . Nodes of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon .",0.9622862339019775,0.0

Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD , but for any given patient , many different mutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop . At a general level , ASD is thought to be a disease of “ incorrect ” wiring . Accordingly , brains of some ASD patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in non-affected people . In the 1990s , a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children . This paper was retracted when it was discovered that the author falsified data , and follow-up studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism .",0.07005419582128525,0.0

18,"Each cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions . Scientists use various techniques to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions : they examine patients who have had injuries or diseases that affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits . They also conduct animal studies where they stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes . They use a technique called transmagnetic stimulation ( TMS ) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head ; and they use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that correlate with specific behavioral tasks . These techniques , and others , have given great insight into the functions of different brain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process , and any given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas . That being said , each hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes : frontal , parietal , temporal , and occipital .

18,"Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord , shown in Figure 35.21 . The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body . The spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves ( part of the peripheral nervous system ) . A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape , as illustrated in Figure 35.25 . Myelinated axons make up the “ white matter ” and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the “ gray matter . ” Gray matter is also composed of interneurons , which connect two neurons each located in different parts of the body . Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal ( facing the back of the animal ) spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain . Axons and cell bodies in the ventral ( facing the front of the animal ) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body . The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes . These reflexes are quick , unconscious movements — like automatically removing a hand from a hot object . Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections . For example , the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron . While a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses , synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened ( the knee jerked , or the hand was hot ) .",0.9959719777107239,1.0
18,"Compared to other vertebrates , mammals have exceptionally large brains for their body size . An entire alligator ’ s brain , for example , would fill about one and a half teaspoons . This increase in brain to body size ratio is especially pronounced in apes , whales , and dolphins . While this increase in overall brain size doubtlessly played a role in the evolution of complex behaviors unique to mammals , it does not tell the whole story . Scientists have found a relationship between the relatively high surface area of the cortex and the intelligence and complex social behaviors exhibited by some mammals . This increased surface area is due , in part , to increased folding of the cortical sheet ( more sulci and gyri ) . For example , a rat cortex is very smooth with very few sulci and gyri . Cat and sheep cortices have more sulci and gyri . Chimps , humans , and dolphins have even more .",0.24324192106723785,0.0

One interesting difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally . There is debate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately or whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow “ flipped ” during the evolution of vertebrates .",0.7196925282478333,0.0

Figure 35.32 provides some statistics concerning comorbidity with ADHD . The cause of ADHD is unknown , although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex and disturbances in neurotransmission . According to studies of twins , the disorder has a strong genetic component . There are several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder , but no definitive links have been discovered .

18,"At one time , scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever have . Research performed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis , the birth of new neurons , continues into adulthood . Neurogenesis was first discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning songs . For mammals , new neurons also play an important role in learning : about 1000 new neurons develop in the hippocampus ( a brain structure involved in learning and memory ) each day . While most of the new neurons will die , researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving new neurons in the hippocampus correlated with how well rats learned a new task . Interestingly , both exercise and some antidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus . Stress has the opposite effect .

18,"Action Potential A neuron can receive input from other neurons and , if this input is strong enough , send the signal to downstream neurons . Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter . Transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from dendrite to axon terminal ) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential . When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’ s dendrites , ion channels open . At excitatory synapses , this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane — a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron . A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential ( - 55 mV ) . Na + channels in the axon hillock open , allowing positive ions to enter the cell ( Figure 35.10 and Figure 35.11 ) . Once the sodium channels open , the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about + 40 mV . Action potentials are considered an "" all-or nothing "" event , in that , once the threshold potential is reached , the neuron always completely depolarizes . Once depolarization is complete , the cell must now "" reset "" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential . To accomplish this , the Na + channels close and cannot be opened . This begins the neuron's refractory period , in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open . At the same time , voltage-gated K + channels open , allowing K + to leave the cell . As K + ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative . The diffusion of K + out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential . At this point , the sodium channels will return to their resting state , meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential . Eventually the extra K + ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels , bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state , back to its resting membrane potential .",0.9672050476074219,1.0

18,"A stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage . Without the oxygen supplied by blood flow , neurons in this brain region die . This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms — depending on the brain area affected — including headache , muscle weakness or paralysis , speech disturbances , sensory problems , memory loss , and confusion . Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel . Strokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States . On average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States . Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65 . Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol , and a family history of stroke . Smoking doubles the risk of stroke . Because a stroke is a medical emergency , patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the emergency room , where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed .

18,"A relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients , including those with ALS , to communicate and retain a degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface ( BCI ) technology and is illustrated in Figure 35.17 . This technology sounds like something out of science fiction : it allows paralyzed patients to control a computer using only their thoughts . There are several forms of BCI . Some forms use EEG recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull . These recordings contain information from large populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer . Other forms of BCI require the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex . This form of BCI , while more invasive , is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from one or more neurons . These signals are then sent to a computer , which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a tool — such as a cursor on a computer screen . This means that a patient with ALS can use e-mail , read the Internet , and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm ( even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement ) .

19,"Now let us look at bonds in more depth . A bond is a type of financial instrument that a company issues directly to investors , bypassing banks or other lending institutions , with a promise to pay the investor a specified rate of interest over a specified period of time . When a company borrows money by selling bonds , it is said the company is “ issuing ” bonds . This means the company exchanges cash for a promise to repay the cash , along with interest , over a set period of time . As you ’ ve learned , bonds are formal legal documents that contain specific information related to the bond . In short , it is a legal contract — called a bond certificate ( as shown in Figure 13.3 ) or an indenture — between the issuer ( the business borrowing the money ) and the lender ( the investor lending the money ) . Bonds are typically issued in relatively small denominations , such as $ 1,000 so they can be placed in the market and are accessible to a greater market of investors compared to notes . The bond indenture is a contract that lists the features of the bond , such as the amount of money that will be repaid in the future , called the principal ( also called face value or maturity value ); the maturity date , the day the bond holder will receive the principal amount ; and the stated interest rate , which is the rate of interest the issuer agrees to pay the bondholder throughout the term of the bond .",1.0113335847854614,1.0

However , corporate bonds often pay a higher rate of interest than municipal bonds . Despite the lower interest rate , one benefit of municipal bonds relates to the tax treatment of the periodic interest payments for investors . With corporate bonds , the periodic interest payments are considered taxable income to the investor . For example , if an investor receives $ 1,000 of interest and is in the 25 % tax bracket , the investor will have to pay $ 250 of taxes on the interest , leaving the investor with an after-tax payment of $ 750 . With municipal bonds , interest payments are exempt from federal tax . So the same investor receiving $ 1,000 of interest from a municipal bond would pay no income tax on the interest income .

19,"Let ’ s summmarize bond characteristics , When businesses borrow money from banks or other investors , the terms of the arrangement , which include the frequency of the periodic interest payments , the interest rate , and the maturity value , are specified in the bond indentures or loan documents . Recall , too , that when the bonds are issued , the bond indenture only specifies how much the borrower will repay the lender on the maturity date . The amount of money received by the business ( borrower ) during the issue is called the bond proceeds . The bond proceeds can be impacted by the market interest rate at the time the bonds are sold . Also , because of the lag time between preparing a bond issuance and selling the bonds , the market dynamics may cause the stated interest rate to change . Rarely , the market rate is equal to the stated rate when the bonds are sold , and the bond proceeds will equal the face value of the bonds . More commonly , the market rate is not equal to the stated rate . If the market rate is higher than the stated rate when the bonds are sold , the bonds will be sold at a discount . If the market rate is lower than the stated rate when the bonds are sold , the bonds will be sold at a premium .

19,"Let ’ s look at bonds from the perspective of the issuer and the investor . As we previously discussed , bonds are often classified as long-term liabilities because the money is borrowed for long periods of time , up to 30 years in some cases . This provides the business with the money necessary to fund long-term projects and investments in the business . Due to unanticipated circumstances , the investors , on the other hand , may not want to wait up to 30 years to receive the maturity value of the bond . While the investor will receive periodic interest payments while the bond is held , investors may want to receive the current market value prior to the maturity date . Therefore , from the investor ’ s perspective , one of the advantages of investing in bonds is that they are typically easy to sell in the secondary market should the investor need the money before the maturity date , which may be many years in the future . The secondary market is an organized market where previously issued stocks and bonds can be traded after they are issued .",0.9624563455581665,0.0

Similarly , if the rate on a bond is 8 % per year but the interest is paid quarterly , the rate used in the interest calculation should be 2 % (8 % ÷ 4 ) .",0.8468735814094543,0.0
19,"For example , earlier we explored a 5 - year , $ 100,000 bond that sold for $ 104,460 . Return to the amortization table in Figure 13.9 and notice the ending value on the bond is equal to the bond face value of $ 100,000 ( ignoring the rounding difference ) . The same is true for bonds sold at a discount . In our example , the $ 100,000 bond sold at $ 91,800 and the carrying value in year five was $ 100,000 . Understanding that the carrying value of bonds will always move toward the bond face value is one trick students can use to ensure the amortization table and related accounting are correct . If , on the maturity date , the bond carrying value does not equal the bond face value , something is incorrect .",0.02539946511387825,0.0
19,"For example , borrowing $ 200,000 for 30 years at an interest rate of 5 % would require the borrow to repay a total $ 386,513 . The monthly payment on this loan is $ 1,073 . 64 . This amount represents the $ 200,000 borrowed and $ 186,513 of interest cost . If the borrower chose a 15 - year loan , the total payments drops significantly to $ 266,757 , but the monthly payments increase to $ 1,581 . 59 .",0.021962078288197517,0.0
19,"For example , assume that $ 500,000 in bonds were issued at a price of $ 540,000 on January 1 , 2019 , with the first annual interest payment to be made on December 31 , 2019 . Assume that the stated interest rate is 10 % and the bond has a four-year life . If the straight-line method is used to amortize the $ 40,000 premium , you would divide the premium of $ 40,000 by the number of payments , in this case four , giving a $ 10,000 per year amortization of the premium . Figure 13.8 shows the effects of the premium amortization after all of the 2019 transactions are considered . The net effect of creating the $ 40,000 premium and writing off $ 10,000 of it gives the company an interest expense of $ 40,000 instead of $ 50,000 , since the $ 50,000 expense is reduced by the $ 10,000 premium write down at the end of the year .",0.021123334765434265,0.0
19,"For a typical bond , the issuer commits to paying a stated interest rate either once a year ( annually ) or twice a year ( semiannually ) . It is important to understand that the stated rate will not go up or down over the life of the bond . This means the borrower will pay the same semiannual or annual interest payment on the same dates for the life of the bond . In other words , when an investor buys a typical bond , the investor will receive , in the future , two major cash flows : periodic interest payments paid either annually or semiannually based on the stated rate of the bond , and the maturity value , which is the total amount paid to the owner of the bond on the maturity date .",0.2767060399055481,0.0

Owners may want to use lending , or debt financing , to obtain the money to run operations , but have to turn to investors , or equity financing . Ethical and legal obligations to investors are typically greater than ethical and legal obligations to lenders . This is because a company ’ s owners have an ethical and legal responsibility to take investors ’ interests into account when making business decisions , even if the decision is not in the founding owners ’ best interest .

19,"Debt financing means borrowing money that will be repaid on a specific date in the future . Many companies have started by incurring debt . To decide whether this is a viable option , the owners need to determine whether they can afford the monthly payments to repay the debt . One positive to this scenario is that interest paid on the debt is tax deductible and can lower the company ’ s tax liability . On the other hand , businesses can struggle to make these payments every month , especially as they are starting out .",0.9707228541374207,0.0
19,"Debt as an option for financing is an important source of funding for businesses . If a company chooses a debt-based option , the business can borrow money on an intermediate ( typically two to four years ) or long-term ( longer than four years ) basis from lenders . In the case of bonds , the funds would be provided by investors . While loans and bonds are similar in that they borrow money on which the borrower will pay interest and eventually repay the lenders , they have some important differences . First , a company can raise funds by borrowing from an individual , bank , or other lender , while a bond is typically sold to numerous investors . When a company chooses a loan , the business signs what is known as a note , and a legal relationship called a note payable is created between the borrower and the lender . The document lists the conditions of the financial arrangement , a fixed predetermined interest rate ( or , if the agreement allows , a variable interest rate ) , the amount borrowed , the borrowing costs to be charged , and the timing of the payments . In some cases , companies will secure an interest-only loan , which means that for the life of the loan the organization pays only the interest expense that has accrued and upon maturity repays the original amount that it borrowed and still owes . For individuals a student loan , car loan , or a mortgage can all be types of notes payable . For Olivia ’ s car purchase in Why It Matters , a document such as a promissory note is typically created , representing a personal loan agreement between a lender and borrower . Figure 13.2 shows a sample promissory note that might be used for a simple , relatively intermediate-term loan . If we were considering a loan that would be repaid over a several-year period the document might be a little more complicated , although it would still have many of the same components of Olivia ’ s loan document .",1.001821756362915,0.0

Wilson does not ask the manager to sign a note but does expect to be paid back . If the club does not pay within 120 days , Wilson will not let them order more items until the bill is paid . Ordering on open credit makes transactions simpler for the club and for Wilson , since there is not a need to formalize every order .

19,"Bonds issued at a discount are the exact opposite in concept as bonds issued at a premium . If , during the timeframe of establishing the bond stated rate and issuing the bonds , the market rate rises above the stated interest on the bonds , the bonds become less valuable because investors can earn a higher rate of interest on other similar bonds . In other words , the investors will earn a lower rate on these bonds than if the investors purchased similar bonds elsewhere in the market . Naturally , investors would not want to purchase these bonds and earn a lower interest rate than could be earned elsewhere . The decreased demand drives down the bond price to a point where investors earn the same interest for similar bonds . Earlier , we found the sale price of a $ 1,000 , 5 - year bond with a stated interest rate of 5 % and a market rate of 7 % is 91.80 .

In the case of a $ 30,000 bond discounted to $ 27,591 . 94 because of an increase in the market rate of interest , the bond quote would be $ 27,591 . 24 / $ 30,000 × 100 , or 91.9708 .

The first principle is there is an inverse relationship between the market rate of interest and the price of the bond . That is , when the market interest rate increases , the price of the bond decreases . This is due to the fact that the stated rate of the bond does not change . 10 As we discussed , when the market interest rate is higher than the stated interest rate of the bond , the bond will sell at a discount to attract investors and to compensate for the interest rate earned between similar bonds . When , on the other hand , the market interest rate is lower than the stated interest rate , the bond will sell at a premium , which also compensates for the interest rate earned between similar bonds . It may be helpful to think of the inverse relationship between the market interest rate and the bond price in terms of analogies such as a teeter-totter in a park or a balance scale , as shown in Figure 13.12 . 10 Another reason for the inverse relationship between the market interest rate and bond prices is due to the time value of money .",0.7508764266967773,0.0

Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth . Approximately 60 – 70 percent of the human body is made up of water . Without it , life as we know it simply would not exist . The polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties that are intimately tied to the processes of life . Life originally evolved in a watery environment , and most of an organism ’ s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell ’ s cytoplasm . Special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization , its ability to dissolve polar molecules , its cohesive and adhesive properties , and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH . Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life .",0.9501488208770752,1.0
20,"Why are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life ? Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for the transport of water from the roots to the leaves in plants . These forces create a “ pull ” on the water column . This pull results from the tendency of water molecules being evaporated on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecules below them , and so they are pulled along . Plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves . Without these properties of water , plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require . In another example , insects such as the water strider , shown in Figure 2.18 , use the surface tension of water to stay afloat on the surface layer of water and even mate there .",0.963447093963623,0.0

It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool . In fact , the specific heat capacity of water is about five times more than that of sand . This explains why the land cools faster than the sea . Due to its high heat capacity , water is used by warm blooded animals to more evenly disperse heat in their bodies : it acts in a similar manner to a car ’ s cooling system , transporting heat from warm places to cool places , causing the body to maintain a more even temperature .",1.0198146104812622,0.0

A considerable amount of heat energy ( 586 cal ) is required to accomplish this change in water . This process occurs on the surface of water . As liquid water heats up , hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules from each other , which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase ( steam ) . As a result , water acts as a heat sink or heat reservoir and requires much more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol ( grain alcohol ) , whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol molecules is weaker than water ’ s hydrogen bonding . Eventually , as water reaches its boiling point of 100 ° Celsius ( 212 ° Fahrenheit ) , the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules , and the kinetic energy ( motion ) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas .

20,"Understanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons ( and electrons ) helps us know how electrons are distributed among the outer shell . The periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located . Take a closer look at the some of the elements in the table ’ s far right column in Figure 2.5 . The group 18 atoms helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , and argon ( Ar ) all have filled outer electron shells , making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability ; they are highly stable as single atoms . Their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases ( or noble gases ) . Compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column . These elements , including hydrogen ( H ) , lithium ( Li ) , and sodium ( Na ) , all have one electron in their outermost shells . That means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water . Hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration , while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable . As a result of losing a negatively charged electron , they become positively charged ions . Group 17 elements , including fluorine and chlorine , have seven electrons in their outmost shells , so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules , making them negatively charged ions . Group 14 elements , of which carbon is the most important to living systems , have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds ( discussed below ) with other atoms . Thus , the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements ’ outer electron shells that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics .",0.9603168368339539,0.0
20,"Under standard conditions , atoms fill the inner shells first , often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost shell . The innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons . This is known as the octet rule , which states , with the exception of the innermost shell , that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell , the outermost electron shell . Examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in Figure 2.7 . Notice that in this Figure 2.7 , helium has a complete outer electron shell , with two electrons filling its first and only shell . Similarly , neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons . In contrast , chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells , respectively , but theoretically they would be more energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight .",0.9172422289848328,0.0

20,"This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer . As Figure 2.11 illustrates , sodium ( Na ) only has one electron in its outer electron shell . It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell . If sodium loses an electron , it now has 11 protons , 11 neutrons , and only 10 electrons , leaving it with an overall charge of + 1 . It is now referred to as a sodium ion . Chlorine ( Cl ) in its lowest energy state ( called the ground state ) has seven electrons in its outer shell . Again , it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven . Therefore , it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons , 17 neutrons , and 18 electrons , giving it a net negative ( – 1 ) charge . It is now referred to as a chloride ion . In this example , sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell , and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell . Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells . Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons , each is now an ion and has a + 1 ( sodium cation ) or – 1 ( chloride anion ) charge . Note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously : in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron , it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom .",0.7416436076164246,0.0
20,"These cohesive forces are related to water ’ s property of adhesion , or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules . This attraction is sometimes stronger than water ’ s cohesive forces , especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes . Adhesion is observed when water “ climbs ” up the tube placed in a glass of water : notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than in the middle . This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it . This type of adhesion is called capillary action , and is illustrated in Figure 2.17 .",1.006923794746399,0.0
20,"There are two types of covalent bonds : polar and nonpolar . In a polar covalent bond , shown in Figure 2.12 , the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other . Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( δ + ) or slightly negative ( δ – ) charge develops . This partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics . Water is a polar molecule , with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge . This occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygen ’ s electrons . Thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms , giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges , respectively . Another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus . Either way , the atom ’ s relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other , and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges . ( Hydrogen bonds , which are discussed in detail below , are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules . ) Since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity , polar bonds are often present in organic molecules .",0.9996368288993835,0.0
20,"The three-dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry . Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and / or chemical bonds are known as isomers . Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in Figure 2.24 a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C 4 H 10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties . For example , due to their different chemical properties , butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches , whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans . Geometric isomers , on the other hand , have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms , especially in carbon-to-carbon double bonds . In the simple molecule butene ( C 4 H 8 ) , the two methyl groups ( CH 3 ) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule , as illustrated in Figure 2.24 b . When the carbons are bound on the same side of the double bond , this is the cis configuration ; if they are on opposite sides of the double bond , it is a trans configuration . In the trans configuration , the carbons form a more or less linear structure , whereas the carbons in the cis configuration make a bend ( change in direction ) of the carbon backbone .

Conversely , strong bases are those substances that readily donate OH – or take up hydrogen ions . Sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up OH – rapidly when placed in water , thereby raising the pH .

After the 1 s orbital is filled , the second electron shell is filled , first filling its 2 s orbital and then its three p orbitals . When filling the p orbitals , each takes a single electron ; once each p orbital has an electron , a second may be added . Lithium ( Li ) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells . Two electrons fill the 1 s orbital , and the third electron then fills the 2 s orbital . Its electron configuration is 1 s 2 2 s 1 . Neon ( Ne ) , on the other hand , has a total of ten electrons : two are in its innermost 1 s orbital and eight fill its second shell ( two each in the 2 s and three p orbitals ); thus , it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms .

The detrimental effect of freezing on living organisms is caused by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water . The ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes essential for the function of living cells , irreversibly damaging them . Cells can only survive freezing if the water in them is temporarily replaced by another liquid like glycerol .",0.6106594800949097,0.0

The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds , as shown in Figure 2.9 . The electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms . To completely fill the outer shell of oxygen , which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with eight , two electrons ( one from each hydrogen atom ) are needed : hence the well-known formula H 2 O . The electrons are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each , making both elements more stable .",0.25932592153549194,0.0
20,"The formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it . As water molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other , water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other liquids and , since living things have a high water content , understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life . In liquid water , hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other . The breaking of these bonds is caused by the motion ( kinetic energy ) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system . When the heat is raised as water is boiled , the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas ( steam or water vapor ) . On the other hand , when the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes , the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding ( there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds ) that makes ice less dense than liquid water , a phenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids .",0.6711726784706116,0.0

20,"The concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 × 10 - 7 moles H + ions per liter of water . Moles ( mol ) are a way to express the amount of a substance ( which can be atoms , molecules , ions , etc ) , with one mole being equal to 6.02 x 10 23 particles of the substance . Therefore , 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 x 10 23 water molecules . The pH is calculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration . The log 10 of 1 × 10 - 7 is -7.0 , and the negative of this number ( indicated by the “ p ” of “ pH ” ) yields a pH of 7.0 , which is also known as neutral pH . The pH inside of human cells and blood are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral pH is maintained . Non-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water . Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers , high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number , whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH . An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H + ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate . A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH – ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH . In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions , these ions bind to free hydrogen ions , generating new water molecules .",0.9935289025306702,1.0

The equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible . Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction . In reversible reactions , reactants are turned into products , but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold ( characteristic of the particular reaction ) , some of these products will be converted back into reactants ; at this point , the designations of products and reactants are reversed .

20,"So how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances ( a human drinking orange juice , for example ) and survive ? Buffers are the key . Buffers readily absorb excess H + or OH – , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival . Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person ’ s well-being . The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid ( H 2 CO 3 ) , bicarbonate ion ( HCO 3 – ) , and carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) . When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid , hydrogen ions are removed , moderating pH changes . Similarly , as shown in Figure 2.20 , excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs . This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood ’ s pH . Likewise , if too much OH – is introduced into the system , carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate , lowering the pH . Without this buffer system , the body ’ s pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy .",0.8887400031089783,1.0

20,"Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges , ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it . Therefore , water is referred to as a solvent , a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds . The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules . This is referred to as a sphere of hydration , or a hydration shell , as illustrated in Figure 2.15 and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water . When ionic compounds are added to water , the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation . Dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions . Consider table salt ( NaCl , or sodium chloride ): when NaCl crystals are added to water , the molecules of NaCl dissociate into Na + and Cl – ions , and spheres of hydration form around the ions , illustrated in Figure 2.15 . The positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecule ’ s oxygen .

20,"Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom ’ s electron shell configuration . Within each electron shell are subshells , and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons . While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located , scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path . Subshells are designated by the letter s , p , d , and f . The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital . Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital , which can hold two electrons . Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell , and can hold a total of eight electrons . The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals , as illustrated in Figure 2.8 . Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals , respectively . These are not shown in the illustration . Principal shell 3n has s , p , and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons . Principal shell 4n has s , p , d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons . Moving away from the nucleus , the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases . Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table , the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital . The closest orbital to the nucleus , called the 1s orbital , can hold up to two electrons . This orbital is equivalent to the innermost electron shell of the Bohr model of the atom . It is called the 1 s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus . The 1 s orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus , and it is always filled first , before any other orbital can be filled . Hydrogen has one electron ; therefore , it has only one spot within the 1 s orbital occupied . This is designated as 1 s 1 , where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1 s orbital . Helium has two electrons ; therefore , it can completely fill the 1 s orbital with its two electrons . This is designated as 1 s 2 , referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1 s orbital . On the periodic table Figure 2.5 , hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row ( period ); this is because they only have electrons in their first shell , the 1 s orbital . Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1 s and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state .",1.0003776550292969,1.0

20,"Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass , about 1.67 × 10 - 24 grams . Scientists arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit ( amu ) or one Dalton , as shown in Table 2.2 . Although similar in mass , protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge . A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged . Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge . Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons , weighing only 9.11 × 10 - 28 grams , or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit . Hence , they do not contribute much to an element ’ s overall atomic mass . Therefore , when considering atomic mass , it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atom ’ s mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone . Although not significant contributors to mass , electrons do contribute greatly to the atom ’ s charge , as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton . In uncharged , neutral atoms , the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus .

Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent , which determines their behavior in biological systems . However , not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds . Weaker bonds can also form between molecules . Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions . Without these two types of bonds , life as we know it would not exist . Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical , life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA , the building block of cells . When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form , the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen ’ s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen . Because the hydrogen is slightly positive , it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges . When this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ + of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ – charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule . This interaction is called a hydrogen bond . This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules . Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken ; however , they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers , creating a major force in combination . Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix . Like hydrogen bonds , van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules . Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities , which are not always symmetrical around an atom . For these attractions to happen , the molecules need to be very close to one another .

The strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules , even though molecular nitrogen , N 2 , is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere . Molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and , as with all molecules , the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron shells , making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms .

Some of the most abundant elements in living organisms include carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , sulfur , and phosphorus . These form the nucleic acids , proteins , carbohydrates , and lipids that are the fundamental components of living matter . Biologists must understand these important building blocks and the unique structures of the atoms that make up molecules , allowing for the formation of cells , tissues , organ systems , and entire organisms . All biological processes follow the laws of physics and chemistry , so in order to understand how biological systems work , it is important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry . For example , the flow of blood within the circulatory system follows the laws of physics that regulate the modes of fluid flow . The breakdown of the large , complex molecules of food into smaller molecules — and the conversion of these to release energy to be stored in adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) — is a series of chemical reactions that follow chemical laws . The properties of water and the formation of hydrogen bonds are key to understanding living processes . Recognizing the properties of acids and bases is important , for example , to our understanding of the digestive process . Therefore , the fundamentals of physics and chemistry are important for gaining insight into biological processes .",0.8787057995796204,0.0

The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon . The carbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms , making this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component , or “ backbone , ” of the macromolecules .",1.015471339225769,1.0
20,"Carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane . Carbon - 14 ( 14 C ) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from atmospheric 14 N ( nitrogen ) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays . This is a continuous process , so more 14 C is always being created . As a living organism incorporates 14 C initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis , the relative amount of 14 C in its body is equal to the concentration of 14 C in the atmosphere . When an organism dies , it is no longer ingesting 14 C , so the ratio between 14 C and 12 C will decline as 14 C decays gradually to 14 N by a process called beta decay — the emission of electrons or positrons . This decay gives off energy in a slow process .",0.9717112183570862,0.0

20,"Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons . The number of protons determines an element ’ s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another . The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess . Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’ s mass number , as illustrated in Figure 2.3 . Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number . This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number . Since an element ’ s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes . Often , the resulting number contains a fraction . For example , the atomic mass of chlorine ( Cl ) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes , some ( the majority ) with atomic mass 35 ( 17 protons and 18 neutrons ) and some with atomic mass 37 ( 17 protons and 20 neutrons ) .",1.0095504522323608,1.0

Carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar ; thus , nonpolar bonds form .

20,"After the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug , the chemist then develops the drug , perhaps chemically altering it , testing it to see if the drug is toxic , and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production . Then , the process of getting the drug approved for human use begins . In the United States , drug approval is handled by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using human subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat . This process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists , in addition to chemists , to complete testing and gain approval . An example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is Paclitaxel ( Taxol ) , an anti-cancer drug used to treat breast cancer . This drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree . Another example is aspirin , originally isolated from willow tree bark . Finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants , fungi , and other forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them . Sometimes , traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found . For example , the use of willow bark to make medicine has been known for thousands of years , dating back to ancient Egypt . It was not until the late 1800s , however , that the aspirin molecule , known as acetylsalicylic acid , was purified and marketed for human use .",0.9851422905921936,0.0
20,"After approximately 5,730 years , half of the starting concentration of 14 C will have been converted back to 14 N . The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form is called its half-life . Because the half-life of 14 C is long , it is used to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood . Comparing the ratio of the 14 C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14 C detected in the atmosphere , the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined . On the basis of this amount , the age of the material , such as the pygmy mammoth shown in Figure 2.4 , can be calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years . Other elements have isotopes with different half lives . For example , 40 K ( potassium - 40 ) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years , and 235 U ( Uranium 235 ) has a half-life of about 700 million years .

Functional groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics . An example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methane molecule . Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group found in amino acids , some amino acid side chains , and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids . This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions ( H + ) from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO - group ; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on . Other functional groups , such as the carbonyl group , have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules , again making the molecule more hydrophilic .",0.9908425807952881,1.0

This law created the Civil Service Commission , which listed all government patronage jobs and then set aside approximately 10 percent of the list as appointments to be determined through a competitive civil service examination process .

Since virtually every train in the United States operated with Pullman cars , the strike truly brought the transportation industry to its knees . Fearful of his ability to end the economic depression with such a vital piece of the economy at a standstill , President Cleveland turned to his attorney general for the answer . The attorney general proposed a solution : use federal troops to operate the trains under the pretense of protecting the delivery of the U . S . mail that was typically found on all trains . When Debs and the American Railway Union refused to obey the court injunction prohibiting interference with the mail , the troops began operating the trains , and the strike quickly ended .

The country was in the middle of the economic downturn caused by the Panic of 1873 , a downturn that would ultimately last until 1879 , all but assuring that Republican incumbent Ulysses S . Grant would not be reelected . Instead , the Republican Party nominated a three-time governor from Ohio , Rutherford B . Hayes . Hayes was a popular candidate who advocated for both “ hard money ” — an economy based upon gold currency transactions — to protect against inflationary pressures and civil service reform , that is , recruitment based upon merit and qualifications , which was to replace the practice of handing out government jobs as “ spoils . ” Most importantly , he had no significant political scandals in his past , unlike his predecessor Grant , who suffered through the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal .

21,"In addition to the cycle of overproduction , tariffs were a serious problem for farmers . Rising tariffs on industrial products made purchased items more expensive , yet tariffs were not being used to keep farm prices artificially high as well . Therefore , farmers were paying inflated prices but not receiving them . Finally , the issue of gold versus silver as the basis of U . S . currency was a very real problem to many farmers . Farmers needed more money in circulation , whether it was paper or silver , in order to create inflationary pressure . Inflationary pressure would allow farm prices to increase , thus allowing them to earn more money that they could then spend on the higher-priced goods in stores . However , in 1878 , federal law set the amount of paper money in circulation , and , as mentioned above , Harrison ’ s Sherman Silver Act , intended to increase the amount of silver coinage , was too modest to do any real good , especially in light of the unintended consequence of depleting the nation ’ s gold reserve . In short , farmers had a big stack of bills and wanted a big stack of money — be it paper or silver — to pay them .

21,"In addition to civil service , President Arthur also carried the reformist spirit into the realm of tariffs , or taxes on international imports to the United States . Tariffs had long been a controversial topic in the United States , especially as the nineteenth century came to a close . Legislators appeared to be bending to the will of big businessmen who desired higher tariffs in order to force Americans to buy their domestically produced goods rather than higher-priced imports . Lower tariffs , on the other hand , would reduce prices and lower the average American ’ s cost of living , and were therefore favored by many working-class families and farmers , to the extent that any of them fully understood such economic forces beyond the prices they paid at stores . Out of growing concern for the latter group , Arthur created the U . S . Tariff Commission in 1882 to investigate the propriety of increasingly high tariffs . Despite his concern , along with the commission ’ s recommendation for a 25 percent rollback in most tariffs , the most Arthur could accomplish was the “ Mongrel Tariff ” of 1883 , which lowered tariff rates by barely 5 percent .",0.9945964813232422,0.0

Cleveland was , however , a notable reform president in terms of business regulation and tariffs . When the U . S . Supreme Court ruled in 1886 that individual states could not regulate interstate transportation , Cleveland urged Congress to pass the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 . Among several other powers , this law created the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) to oversee railroad prices and ensure that they remained reasonable to all customers . This was an important shift . In the past , railroads had granted special rebates to big businesses , such as John D .

Although the act eventually provided for real regulation of the railroad industry , initial progress was slow due to the lack of enforcement power held by the ICC .

Voter turnout was the largest in American history to that date ; while both candidates benefitted , McKinley did more so than Bryan ( Figure 20.18 ) .",0.02227320708334446,0.0
21,"Although unpopular among the voting electorate , especially among African Americans who referred to it as “ The Great Betrayal , ” the compromise exposed the willingness of the two major political parties to avoid a “ stand-off ” via a southern Democrat filibuster , which would have greatly prolonged the final decision regarding the election . Democrats were largely satisfied to end Reconstruction and maintain “ home rule ” in the South in exchange for control over the White House . Likewise , most realized that Hayes would likely be a one-term president at best and prove to be as ineffectual as his pre-Civil War predecessors .",0.9530864953994751,0.0
21,"Although political corruption , the spoils system , and the question of tariff rates were popular discussions of the day , none were more relevant to working-class Americans and farmers than the issue of the nation ’ s monetary policy and the ongoing debate of gold versus silver ( Figure 20.11 ) . There had been frequent attempts to establish a bimetallic standard , which in turn would have created inflationary pressures and placed more money into circulation that could have subsequently benefitted farmers . But the government remained committed to the gold standard , including the official demonetizing of silver altogether in 1873 .

Once elected , presidents had barely enough power to repay the political favors they owed to the individuals who ensured their narrow victories in cities and regions around the country . Their four years in office were spent repaying favors and managing the powerful relationships that put them in the White House . Everyday Americans were largely left on their own .

By April of that year , radical Reconstruction ended as promised , with the removal of federal troops from the final two Reconstruction states , South Carolina and Louisiana .

21,"A notable example of the government ’ s failure to act was the story of Coxey ’ s Army . In the spring of 1894 , businessman Jacob Coxey led a march of unemployed Ohioans from Cincinnati to Washington , DC , where leaders of the group urged Congress to pass public works legislation for the federal government to hire unemployed workers to build roads and other public projects . From the original one hundred protesters , the march grew five hundred strong as others joined along the route to the nation ’ s capital . Upon their arrival , not only were their cries for federal relief ignored , but Coxey and several other marchers were arrested for trespassing on the grass outside the U . S . Capitol . Frustration over the event led many angry workers to consider supporting the Populist Party in subsequent elections . Americana L . Frank Baum : Did Coxey ’ s Army inspire Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz ? Scholars , historians , and economists have long argued inconclusively that L . Frank Baum intended the story of The Wizard of Oz as an allegory for the politics of the day . Whether that actually was Baum ’ s intention is up for debate , but certainly the story could be read as support for the Populist Party ’ s crusade on behalf of American farmers .

Once a unit of blood has been requested for transfusion , it is vitally important to make sure the donor ( unit of blood ) and recipient ( patient ) are compatible for these crucial antigens . In addition to confirming the blood type of the unit , the patient ’ s blood type is also confirmed using the same commercially prepared antibodies to A , B , and Rh . For example , as shown in Figure 20.21 , if the donor blood is A-positive , it will agglutinate with the anti-A antiserum and with the anti-Rh antiserum .

22,"Unlike polyclonal antibodies , which are produced in live animals , monoclonal antibodies are produced in vitro using tissue-culture techniques . mAbs are produced by immunizing an animal , often a mouse , multiple times with a specific antigen . B cells from the spleen of the immunized animal are then removed . Since normal B cells are unable to proliferate forever , they are fused with immortal , cancerous B cells called myeloma cells , to yield hybridoma cells . All of the cells are then placed in a selective medium that allows only the hybridomas to grow ; unfused myeloma cells cannot grow , and any unfused B cells die off . The hybridomas , which are capable of growing continuously in culture while producing antibodies , are then screened for the desired mAb . Those producing the desired mAb are grown in tissue culture ; the culture medium is harvested periodically and mAbs are purified from the medium . This is a very expensive and time-consuming process . It may take weeks of culturing and many liters of media to provide enough mAbs for an experiment or to treat a single patient . mAbs are expensive ( Figure 20.4 ) .",0.9856507182121277,1.0

This technique is most often used when looking for IgM antibodies , because their structure provides maximum cross-linking . One widely used example of this assay is a test for rheumatoid factor ( RF ) to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis .

Wells are cut in the cooled agar , and antigen is then added to the wells and allowed to diffuse . As the antigen and antibody interact , they form a zone of precipitation . The square of the diameter of the zone of precipitation is directly proportional to the concentration of antigen . By measuring the zones of precipitation produced by samples of known concentration ( see the outer ring of samples in Figure 20.9 ) , we can prepare a standard curve for determining the concentration of an unknown solution .

When Swedish biochemist Arne Tiselius ( 1902 – 1971 ) published the first protein electrophoresis results in 1937 , 7 he could identify the protein albumin ( the smallest and most abundant serum protein ) by the sharp band it produced in the gel . The other serum proteins could not be resolved in a simple protein electrophoresis , so he named the three broad bands , with many proteins in each band , alpha , beta , and gamma globulins . Two years later , American immunologist Elvin Kabat ( 1914 – 2000 ) traveled to Sweden to work with Tiselius using this new technique and showed that antibodies migrated as gamma globulins . 8 With this new understanding in hand , researchers soon learned that multiple myeloma , because it is a cancer of antibody-secreting cells , could be tentatively diagnosed by the presence of a large M spike in the gamma-globulin region by protein electrophoresis . Prior to this discovery , studies on immunoglobulin structure had been minimal , because of the difficulty of obtaining pure samples to study . Sera from multiple myeloma patients proved to be an excellent source of highly enriched monoclonal immunoglobulin , providing the raw material for studies over the next 20 - plus years that resulted in the elucidation of the structure of immunoglobulin . 7 Tiselius , Arne , “ Electrophoresis of Serum Globulin : Electrophoretic Analysis of Normal and Immune Sera , ” Biochemical Journal 31 , no . 9 ( 1937 ): 1464 . 8 Tiselius , Arne and Elvin A .

22,"Like ELISA techniques , lateral flow tests take advantage of antibody sandwiches , providing sensitivity and specificity . While not as quantitative as ELISA , these tests have the advantage of being fast , inexpensive , and not dependent on special equipment . Thus , they can be performed anywhere by anyone . There are some concerns about putting such powerful diagnostic tests into the hands of people who may not understand the tests ’ limitations , such as the possibility of false-positive results . While home pregnancy tests have become widely accepted , at-home antibody-detection tests for diseases like HIV have raised some concerns in the medical community . Some have questioned whether self-administration of such tests should be allowed in the absence of medical personnel who can explain the test results and order appropriate confirmatory tests . However , with growing numbers of lateral flow tests becoming available , and the rapid development of lab-on-a-chip technology ( Figure 20.1 ) , home medical tests are likely to become even more commonplace in the future .",0.9831517934799194,0.0

22,"In an indirect ELISA , we quantify antigen-specific antibody rather than antigen . We can use indirect ELISA to detect antibodies against many types of pathogens , including Borrelia burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ) and HIV . There are three important differences between indirect and direct ELISAs as shown in Figure 20.25 . Rather than using antibody to capture antigen , the indirect ELISA starts with attaching known antigen ( e . g . , peptides from HIV ) to the bottom of the microtiter plate wells . After blocking the unbound sites on the plate , patient serum is added ; if antibodies are present ( primary antibody ) , they will bind the antigen . After washing away any unbound proteins , the secondary antibody with its conjugated enzyme is directed against the primary antibody ( e . g . , antihuman immunoglobulin ) . The secondary antibody allows us to quantify how much antigen-specific antibody is present in the patient ’ s serum by the intensity of the color produced from the conjugated enzyme-chromogen reaction .",0.9798396825790405,0.0
22,"In addition to their role in diagnosis , polyclonal antisera can activate complement , detect the presence of bacteria in clinical and food industry settings , and perform a wide array of precipitation reactions that can detect and quantify serum proteins , viruses , or other antigens .

The false-positive rate depends on the particular brand of test used , but 0.5 % is not unusual . 10 Because of the possibility of a false positive , all positive tests are followed up with a confirmatory test . This confirmatory test is often an immunoblot ( western blot ) in which HIV peptides from the patient ’ s blood are identified using an HIV-specific mAb-enzyme conjugate .

Agglutination assays are usually quick and easy to perform on a glass slide or microtiter plate ( Figure 20.15 ) .

22,"In a sandwich ELISA , the goal is to use antibodies to precisely quantify specific antigen present in a solution , such as antigen from a pathogen , a serum protein , or a hormone from the blood or urine to list just a few examples . The first step of a sandwich ELISA is to add the primary antibody to all the wells of a microtiter plate ( Figure 20.24 ) . The antibody sticks to the plastic by hydrophobic interactions . After an appropriate incubation time , any unbound antibody is washed away . Comparable washes are used between each of the subsequent steps to ensure that only specifically bound molecules remain attached to the plate . A blocking protein is then added ( e . g . , albumin or the milk protein casein ) to bind the remaining nonspecific protein-binding sites in the well . Some of the wells will receive known amounts of antigen to allow the construction of a standard curve , and unknown antigen solutions are added to the other wells . The primary antibody captures the antigen and , following a wash , the secondary antibody is added , which is a polyclonal antibody that is conjugated to an enzyme . After a final wash , a colorless substrate ( chromogen ) is added , and the enzyme converts it into a colored end product . The color intensity of the sample caused by the end product is measured with a spectrophotometer . The amount of color produced ( measured as absorbance ) is directly proportional to the amount of enzyme , which in turn is directly proportional to the captured antigen .

To perform the assay , a serial dilution is carried out on a serum sample . Each dilution is then mixed with a standardized amount of the suspect virus . Any virus-specific antibodies in the serum will neutralize some of the virus . The suspensions are then added to host cells in culture to allow any nonneutralized virus to infect the cells and form plaques after several days . The titer is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing a 50 % reduction in plaques . Titer is always expressed as a whole number .

Within a few weeks , the animal ’ s immune system will produce high levels of antibodies specific for the antigen . These antibodies can be harvested in an antiserum , which is whole serum collected from an animal following exposure to an antigen . Because most antigens are complex structures with multiple epitopes , they result in the production of multiple antibodies in the lab animal . This so-called polyclonal antibody response is also typical of the response to infection by the human immune system .

22,"Antibodies that bind to red blood cells are not the only cause of hemagglutination . Some viruses also bind to red blood cells , and this binding can cause agglutination when the viruses cross-link the red blood cells . For example , influenza viruses have two different types of viral spikes called neuraminidase ( N ) and hemagglutinin ( H ) , the latter named for its ability to agglutinate red blood cells ( see Viruses ) .

22,"After performing protein gel electrophoresis , specific proteins can be identified in the gel using antibodies . This technique is known as the western blot . Following separation of proteins by PAGE , the protein antigens in the gel are transferred to and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane . This membrane can then be exposed to a primary antibody produced to specifically bind to the protein of interest . A second antibody equipped with a molecular beacon will then bind to the first . These secondary antibodies are coupled to another molecule such as an enzyme or a fluorophore ( a molecule that fluoresces when excited by light ) . When using antibodies coupled to enzymes , a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme is added . This substrate is usually colorless but will develop color in the presence of the antibody .

22,"A visible antigen-antibody complex is called a precipitin , and in vitro assays that produce a precipitin are called precipitin reactions . A precipitin reaction typically involves adding soluble antigens to a test tube containing a solution of antibodies . Each antibody has two arms , each of which can bind to an epitope . When an antibody binds to two antigens , the two antigens become bound together by the antibody . A lattice can form as antibodies bind more and more antigens together , resulting in a precipitin ( Figure 20.5 ) . Most precipitin tests use a polyclonal antiserum rather than monoclonal antibodies because polyclonal antibodies can bind to multiple epitopes , making lattice formation more likely . Although mAbs may bind some antigens , the binding will occur less often , making it much less likely that a visible precipitin will form .",1.0234410762786865,0.0
22,"A variety of techniques allow us to use precipitin formation to quantify either antigen concentration or the amount of antibody present in an antiserum . One such technique is the precipitin ring test ( Figure 20.7 ) , which is used to determine the relative amount of antigen-specific antibody in a sample of serum . To perform this test , a set of test tubes is prepared by adding an antigen solution to the bottom of each tube . Each tube receives the same volume of solution , and the concentration of antigens is constant ( e . g . , 1 mg / mL ) . Next , glycerol is added to the antigen solution in each test tube , followed by a serial dilution of the antiserum . The glycerol prevents mixing of the antiserum with the antigen solution , allowing antigen-antibody binding to take place only at the interface of the two solutions . The result is a visible ring of precipitin in the tubes that have an antigen-antibody ratio within the equivalence zone . This highest dilution with a visible ring is used to determine the titer of the antibodies . The titer is the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing a positive result , expressed as a whole number . In Figure 20.7 , the titer is 16 .",0.9542416334152222,0.0

The presence of these antibodies in a patient ’ s serum or in a lab-produced antiserum will neutralize the virus and block it from agglutinating the red cells , making this a viral hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HIA ) . In this assay , patient serum is mixed with a standardized amount of virus . After a short incubation , a standardized amount of red blood cells is added and hemagglutination is observed .

According to Laffer ’ s argument , this would eventually translate into more jobs further down the socioeconomic ladder . Economic growth would also increase the total tax revenue — even at a lower tax rate .

The federal government supported the trend with federal sentencing guidelines and additional funds for local law enforcement agencies .

As a result , prisons became crowded , and states went deep into debt to build more .

23,"Launched in 1973 with a $ 250,000 contribution from Joseph Coors ( of Coors Brewing Company ) and support from a variety of corporations and conservative foundations , the Heritage Foundation sought to counteract what conservatives believed to be Richard Nixon ’ s acceptance of a liberal consensus on too many issues . In producing its policy position papers and political recommendations to conservative candidates and politicians , it helped contribute to a sanitization of U .

The foundation had lent considerable support and encouragement to the conservative dialogues that helped carry Ronald Reagan into office in 1980 . Just a year later , it produced a document entitled Mandate for Leadership that catalogued some two thousand specific recommendations on how to shrink the size and reach of the federal government and implement a more consistent conservative agenda . The newly elected Reagan administration looked favorably on the recommendations and recruited several of the paper ’ s authors to serve in the White House .",0.9786093831062317,0.0

23,"Although many of his movie roles and the persona he created for himself seemed to represent traditional values , Reagan ’ s rise to the presidency was an unusual transition from pop cultural significance to political success . Born and raised in the Midwest , he moved to California in 1937 to become a Hollywood actor . He also became a reserve officer in the U . S . Army that same year , but when the country entered World War II , he was excluded from active duty overseas because of poor eyesight and spent the war in the army ’ s First Motion Picture Unit . After the war , he resumed his film career ; rose to leadership in the Screen Actors Guild , a Hollywood union ; and became a spokesman for General Electric and the host of a television series that the company sponsored . As a young man , he identified politically as a liberal Democrat , but his distaste for communism , along with the influence of the social conservative values of his second wife , actress Nancy Davis , edged him closer to conservative Republicanism ( Figure 31.3 ) . By 1962 , he had formally switched political parties , and in 1964 , he actively campaigned for the Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater .",0.025199519470334053,1.0
23,"Although he promised to carry on Reagan ’ s economic legacy , the problems Bush inherited made it difficult to do so . Reagan ’ s policies of cutting taxes and increasing defense spending had exploded the federal budget deficit , making it three times larger in 1989 than when Reagan took office in 1980 . Bush was further constrained by the emphatic pledge he had made at the 1988 Republican Convention — “ read my lips : no new taxes ” — and found himself in the difficult position of trying to balance the budget and reduce the deficit without breaking his promise . However , he also faced a Congress controlled by the Democrats , who wanted to raise taxes on the rich , while Republicans thought the government should drastically cut domestic spending . In October , after a brief government shutdown when Bush vetoed the budget Congress delivered , he and Congress reached a compromise with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 . The budget included measures to reduce the deficit by both cutting government expenditures and raising taxes , effectively reneging on the “ no new taxes ” pledge . These economic constraints are one reason why Bush supported a limited domestic agenda of education reform and antidrug efforts , relying on private volunteers and community organizations , which he referred to as “ a thousand points of light , ” to address most social problems .",0.6426973342895508,0.0

Instead of lifting the longstanding ban , the armed forces would adopt a policy of “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell . ” Those on active duty would not be asked their sexual orientation and , if they were gay , they were not to discuss their sexuality openly or they would be dismissed from military service .

23,"After two unsuccessful Republican primary bids in 1968 and 1976 , Reagan won the presidency in 1980 . His victory was the result of a combination of dissatisfaction with the presidential leadership of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s and the growth of the New Right . This group of conservative Americans included many very wealthy financial supporters and emerged in the wake of the social reforms and cultural changes of the 1960s and 1970s . Many were evangelical Christians , like those who joined Jerry Falwell ’ s Moral Majority , and opposed the legalization of abortion , the feminist movement , and sex education in public schools . Reagan also attracted people , often dubbed neoconservatives , who would not previously have voted for the same candidate as conservative Protestants did . Many were middle - and working-class people who resented the growth of federal and state governments , especially benefit programs , and the subsequent increase in taxes during the late 1960s and 1970s . They favored the tax revolts that swept the nation in the late 1970s under the leadership of predominantly older , White , middle-class Americans , which had succeeded in imposing radical reductions in local property and state income taxes .",0.7956961393356323,0.0
23,"After his reelection in 1984 , Reagan began to moderate his position toward the Soviets . Mikhail Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and was willing to meet with the president . Reagan found he was able to work with the Soviet leader once Gorbachev distanced himself from the traditional communist policies . The new and comparatively young Soviet premier did not want to commit additional funds for another arms race , especially since the war in Afghanistan against mujahedeen — Islamic guerilla fighters — had depleted the Soviet Union ’ s resources severely since its invasion of the central Asian nation in 1979 . Gorbachev recognized that economic despair at home could easily result in larger political upheavals like those in neighboring Poland , where the Solidarity movement had taken hold . He withdrew troops from Afghanistan , introduced political reforms and new civil liberties at home — known as perestroika and glasnost — and proposed arms reduction talks with the United States . In 1985 , Gorbachev and Reagan met in Geneva to reduce armaments and shrink their respective military budgets . The following year , meeting in Reykjavík , Iceland , they surprised the world by announcing that they would try to eliminate nuclear weapons by 1996 . In 1987 , they agreed to eliminate a whole category of nuclear weapons when they signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty at the White House ( Figure 31.12 ) .

Eventually the Senate became aware , and North and others were indicted on various charges , which were all dismissed , overturned on appeal , or granted presidential pardon . Reagan , known for delegating much authority to subordinates and unable to “ remember ” crucial facts and meetings , escaped the scandal with nothing more than criticism for his lax oversight .

24,"Within a few moments after food enters your stomach , mixing waves begin to occur at intervals of approximately 20 seconds . A mixing wave is a unique type of peristalsis that mixes and softens the food with gastric juices to create chyme . The initial mixing waves are relatively gentle , but these are followed by more intense waves , starting at the body of the stomach and increasing in force as they reach the pylorus . It is fair to say that long before your sushi exits through the pyloric sphincter , it bears little resemblance to the sushi you ate . The pylorus , which holds around 30 mL ( 1 fluid ounce ) of chyme , acts as a filter , permitting only liquids and small food particles to pass through the mostly , but not fully , closed pyloric sphincter . In a process called gastric emptying , rhythmic mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum . Release of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle it . The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach , where it continues mixing . This process is repeated when the next mixing waves force more chyme into the duodenum .",1.0049972534179688,1.0

24,"When most of the chyme has been absorbed , the small intestinal wall becomes less distended . At this point , the localized segmentation process is replaced by transport movements . The duodenal mucosa secretes the hormone motilin , which initiates peristalsis in the form of a migrating motility complex . These complexes , which begin in the duodenum , force chyme through a short section of the small intestine and then stop . The next contraction begins a little bit farther down than the first , forces chyme a bit farther through the small intestine , then stops . These complexes move slowly down the small intestine , forcing chyme on the way , taking around 90 to 120 minutes to finally reach the end of the ileum . At this point , the process is repeated , starting in the duodenum . The ileocecal valve , a sphincter , is usually in a constricted state , but when motility in the ileum increases , this sphincter relaxes , allowing food residue to enter the first portion of the large intestine , the cecum . Relaxation of the ileocecal sphincter is controlled by both nerves and hormones . First , digestive activity in the stomach provokes the gastroileal reflex , which increases the force of ileal segmentation . Second , the stomach releases the hormone gastrin , which enhances ileal motility , thus relaxing the ileocecal sphincter . After chyme passes through , backward pressure helps close the sphincter , preventing backflow into the ileum . Because of this reflex , your lunch is completely emptied from your stomach and small intestine by the time you eat your dinner . It takes about 3 to 5 hours for all chyme to leave the small intestine .",0.9943404793739319,0.0

The teniae coli are three bands of smooth muscle that make up the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis of the large intestine , except at its terminal end . Tonic contractions of the teniae coli bunch up the colon into a succession of pouches called haustra ( singular = haustrum ) , which are responsible for the wrinkled appearance of the colon . Attached to the teniae coli are small , fat-filled sacs of visceral peritoneum called epiploic appendages . The purpose of these is unknown .

The stratified squamous epithelial mucosa of the anal canal connects to the skin on the outside of the anus . This mucosa varies considerably from that of the rest of the colon to accommodate the high level of abrasion as feces pass through .

24,"There are four main regions in the stomach : the cardia , fundus , body , and pylorus ( Figure 23.15 ) . The cardia ( or cardiac region ) is the point where the esophagus connects to the stomach and through which food passes into the stomach . Located inferior to the diaphragm , above and to the left of the cardia , is the dome-shaped fundus . Below the fundus is the body , the main part of the stomach . The funnel-shaped pylorus connects the stomach to the duodenum . The wider end of the funnel , the pyloric antrum , connects to the body of the stomach . The narrower end is called the pyloric canal , which connects to the duodenum . The smooth muscle pyloric sphincter is located at this latter point of connection and controls stomach emptying . In the absence of food , the stomach deflates inward , and its mucosa and submucosa fall into a large fold called a ruga . The convex lateral surface of the stomach is called the greater curvature ; the concave medial border is the lesser curvature .

24,"The walls of the entire alimentary canal are embedded with nerve plexuses that interact with the central nervous system and other nerve plexuses — either within the same digestive organ or in different ones . These interactions prompt several types of reflexes . Extrinsic nerve plexuses orchestrate long reflexes , which involve the central and autonomic nervous systems and work in response to stimuli from outside the digestive system . Short reflexes , on the other hand , are orchestrated by intrinsic nerve plexuses within the alimentary canal wall . These two plexuses and their connections were introduced earlier as the enteric nervous system . Short reflexes regulate activities in one area of the digestive tract and may coordinate local peristaltic movements and stimulate digestive secretions . For example , the sight , smell , and taste of food initiate long reflexes that begin with a sensory neuron delivering a signal to the medulla oblongata . The response to the signal is to stimulate cells in the stomach to begin secreting digestive juices in preparation for incoming food . In contrast , food that distends the stomach initiates short reflexes that cause cells in the stomach wall to increase their secretion of digestive juices .",1.0106379985809326,0.0

Stimulation of these receptors provokes an appropriate reflex that furthers the process of digestion . This may entail sending a message that activates the glands that secrete digestive juices into the lumen , or it may mean the stimulation of muscles within the alimentary canal , thereby activating peristalsis and segmentation that move food along the intestinal tract .",0.975935697555542,0.0

The upper two-thirds of the esophagus consists of both smooth and skeletal muscle fibers , with the latter fading out in the bottom third of the esophagus . Rhythmic waves of peristalsis , which begin in the upper esophagus , propel the bolus of food toward the stomach . Meanwhile , secretions from the esophageal mucosa lubricate the esophagus and food . Food passes from the esophagus into the stomach at the lower esophageal sphincter ( also called the gastroesophageal or cardiac sphincter ) . Recall that sphincters are muscles that surround tubes and serve as valves , closing the tube when the sphincters contract and opening it when they relax . The lower esophageal sphincter relaxes to let food pass into the stomach , and then contracts to prevent stomach acids from backing up into the esophagus . Surrounding this sphincter is the muscular diaphragm , which helps close off the sphincter when no food is being swallowed . When the lower esophageal sphincter does not completely close , the stomach ’ s contents can reflux ( that is , back up into the esophagus ) , causing heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) .",0.9941879510879517,0.0

In contrast , filiform papillae are long and thin . Fungiform papillae contain taste buds , and filiform papillae have touch receptors that help the tongue move food around in the mouth . The filiform papillae create an abrasive surface that performs mechanically , much like a cat ’ s rough tongue that is used for grooming . Lingual glands in the lamina propria of the tongue secrete mucus and a watery serous fluid that contains the enzyme lingual lipase , which plays a minor role in breaking down triglycerides but does not begin working until it is activated in the stomach .

24,"The third layer of the alimentary canal is the muscularis ( also called the muscularis externa ) . The muscularis in the small intestine is made up of a double layer of smooth muscle : an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer . The contractions of these layers promote mechanical digestion , expose more of the food to digestive chemicals , and move the food along the canal . In the most proximal and distal regions of the alimentary canal , including the mouth , pharynx , anterior part of the esophagus , and external anal sphincter , the muscularis is made up of skeletal muscle , which gives you voluntary control over swallowing and defecation . The basic two-layer structure found in the small intestine is modified in the organs proximal and distal to it . The stomach is equipped for its churning function by the addition of a third layer , the oblique muscle . While the colon has two layers like the small intestine , its longitudinal layer is segregated into three narrow parallel bands , the tenia coli , which make it look like a series of pouches rather than a simple tube . The serosa is the portion of the alimentary canal superficial to the muscularis . Present only in the region of the alimentary canal within the abdominal cavity , it consists of a layer of visceral peritoneum overlying a layer of loose connective tissue .

24,"Saliva is essentially ( 98 to 99.5 percent ) water . The remaining 4.5 percent is a complex mixture of ions , glycoproteins , enzymes , growth factors , and waste products . Perhaps the most important ingredient in saliva from the perspective of digestion is the enzyme salivary amylase , which initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates . Food does not spend enough time in the mouth to allow all the carbohydrates to break down , but salivary amylase continues acting until it is inactivated by stomach acids . Bicarbonate and phosphate ions function as chemical buffers , maintaining saliva at a pH between 6.35 and 6.85 . Salivary mucus helps lubricate food , facilitating movement in the mouth , bolus formation , and swallowing . Saliva contains immunoglobulin A , which prevents microbes from penetrating the epithelium , and lysozyme , which makes saliva antimicrobial . Saliva also contains epidermal growth factor , which might have given rise to the adage “ a mother ’ s kiss can heal a wound . ” Each of the major salivary glands secretes a unique formulation of saliva according to its cellular makeup . For example , the parotid glands secrete a watery solution that contains salivary amylase . The submandibular glands have cells similar to those of the parotid glands , as well as mucus-secreting cells . Therefore , saliva secreted by the submandibular glands also contains amylase but in a liquid thickened with mucus . The sublingual glands contain mostly mucous cells , and they secrete the thickest saliva with the least amount of salivary amylase .",0.9800384640693665,0.0

24,"Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements . The presence of food residues in the colon stimulates a slow-moving haustral contraction . This type of movement involves sluggish segmentation , primarily in the transverse and descending colons . When a haustrum is distended with chyme , its muscle contracts , pushing the residue into the next haustrum . These contractions occur about every 30 minutes , and each last about 1 minute . These movements also mix the food residue , which helps the large intestine absorb water . The second type of movement is peristalsis , which , in the large intestine , is slower than in the more proximal portions of the alimentary canal . The third type is a mass movement . These strong waves start midway through the transverse colon and quickly force the contents toward the rectum . Mass movements usually occur three or four times per day , either while you eat or immediately afterward . Distension in the stomach and the breakdown products of digestion in the small intestine provoke the gastrocolic reflex , which increases motility , including mass movements , in the colon .

24,"Introduction The digestive system is continually at work , yet people seldom appreciate the complex tasks it performs in a choreographed biologic symphony . Consider what happens when you eat an apple . Of course , you enjoy the apple ’ s taste as you chew it , but in the hours that follow , unless something goes amiss and you get a stomachache , you don ’ t notice that your digestive system is working . You may be taking a walk or studying or sleeping , having forgotten all about the apple , but your stomach and intestines are busy digesting it and absorbing its vitamins and other nutrients . By the time any waste material is excreted , the body has appropriated all it can use from the apple . In short , whether you pay attention or not , the organs of the digestive system perform their specific functions , allowing you to use the food you eat to keep you going . This chapter examines the structure and functions of these organs , and explores the mechanics and chemistry of the digestive processes .",0.03755363076925278,0.0
24,"Intrinsic innervation of much of the alimentary canal is provided by the enteric nervous system , which runs from the esophagus to the anus , and contains approximately 100 million motor , sensory , and interneurons ( unique to this system compared to all other parts of the peripheral nervous system ) . These enteric neurons are grouped into two plexuses . The myenteric plexus ( plexus of Auerbach ) lies in the muscularis layer of the alimentary canal and is responsible for motility , especially the rhythm and force of the contractions of the muscularis . The submucosal plexus ( plexus of Meissner ) lies in the submucosal layer and is responsible for regulating digestive secretions and reacting to the presence of food ( see Figure 23.3 ) . Extrinsic innervations of the alimentary canal are provided by the autonomic nervous system , which includes both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves . In general , sympathetic activation ( the fight-or-flight response ) restricts the activity of enteric neurons , thereby decreasing GI secretion and motility . In contrast , parasympathetic activation ( the rest-and-digest response ) increases GI secretion and motility by stimulating neurons of the enteric nervous system .",0.9294058680534363,0.0

Chemical peritonitis can develop any time the wall of the alimentary canal is breached , allowing the contents of the lumen entry into the peritoneal cavity . For example , when an ulcer perforates the stomach wall , gastric juices spill into the peritoneal cavity . Hemorrhagic peritonitis occurs after a ruptured tubal pregnancy or traumatic injury to the liver or spleen fills the peritoneal cavity with blood . Even more severe peritonitis is associated with bacterial infections seen with appendicitis , colonic diverticulitis , and pelvic inflammatory disease ( infection of uterine tubes , usually by sexually transmitted bacteria ) . Peritonitis is life threatening and often results in emergency surgery to correct the underlying problem and intensive antibiotic therapy . When your great grandparents and even your parents were young , the mortality from peritonitis was high .

A yellow-brown or yellow-green alkaline solution ( pH 7.6 to 8.6 ) , bile is a mixture of water , bile salts , bile pigments , phospholipids ( such as lecithin ) , electrolytes , cholesterol , and triglycerides . The components most critical to emulsification are bile salts and phospholipids , which have a nonpolar ( hydrophobic ) region as well as a polar ( hydrophilic ) region . The hydrophobic region interacts with the large lipid molecules , whereas the hydrophilic region interacts with the watery chyme in the intestine . This results in the large lipid globules being pulled apart into many tiny lipid fragments of about 1 µ m in diameter . This change dramatically increases the surface area available for lipid-digesting enzyme activity . This is the same way dish soap works on fats mixed with water . Bile salts act as emulsifying agents , so they are also important for the absorption of digested lipids . While most constituents of bile are eliminated in feces , bile salts are reclaimed by the enterohepatic circulation . Once bile salts reach the ileum , they are absorbed and returned to the liver in the hepatic portal blood . The hepatocytes then excrete the bile salts into newly formed bile .

24,"Chyme released from the stomach enters the small intestine , which is the primary digestive organ in the body . Not only is this where most digestion occurs , it is also where practically all absorption occurs . The longest part of the alimentary canal , the small intestine is about 3.05 meters ( 10 feet ) long in a living person ( but about twice as long in a cadaver due to the loss of muscle tone ) . Since this makes it about five times longer than the large intestine , you might wonder why it is called “ small . ” In fact , its name derives from its relatively smaller diameter of only about 2.54 cm ( 1 in ) , compared with 7.62 cm ( 3 in ) for the large intestine . As we ’ ll see shortly , in addition to its length , the folds and projections of the lining of the small intestine work to give it an enormous surface area , which is approximately 200 m 2 , more than 100 times the surface area of your skin .

24,"At the entrance to the mouth are the lips , or labia ( singular = labium ) . Their outer covering is skin , which transitions to a mucous membrane in the mouth proper . Lips are very vascular with a thin layer of keratin ; hence , the reason they are "" red . "" They have a huge representation on the cerebral cortex , which probably explains the human fascination with kissing ! The lips cover the orbicularis oris muscle , which regulates what comes in and goes out of the mouth . The labial frenulum is a midline fold of mucous membrane that attaches the inner surface of each lip to the gum . The cheeks make up the oral cavity ’ s sidewalls . While their outer covering is skin , their inner covering is mucous membrane . This membrane is made up of non-keratinized , stratified squamous epithelium . Between the skin and mucous membranes are connective tissue and buccinator muscles . The next time you eat some food , notice how the buccinator muscles in your cheeks and the orbicularis oris muscle in your lips contract , helping you keep the food from falling out of your mouth . Additionally , notice how these muscles work when you are speaking . The pocket-like part of the mouth that is framed on the inside by the gums and teeth , and on the outside by the cheeks and lips is called the oral vestibule . Moving farther into the mouth , the opening between the oral cavity and throat ( oropharynx ) is called the fauces ( like the kitchen "" faucet "" ) . The main open area of the mouth , or oral cavity proper , runs from the gums and teeth to the fauces . When you are chewing , you do not find it difficult to breathe simultaneously . The next time you have food in your mouth , notice how the arched shape of the roof of your mouth allows you to handle both digestion and respiration at the same time . This arch is called the palate . The anterior region of the palate serves as a wall ( or septum ) between the oral and nasal cavities as well as a rigid shelf against which the tongue can push food . It is created by the maxillary and palatine bones of the skull and , given its bony structure , is known as the hard palate . If you run your tongue along the roof of your mouth , you ’ ll notice that the hard palate ends in the posterior oral cavity , and the tissue becomes fleshier . This part of the palate , known as the soft palate , is composed mainly of skeletal muscle . You can therefore manipulate , subconsciously , the soft palate — for instance , to yawn , swallow , or sing ( see Figure 23.7 ) .",1.0079013109207153,0.0

Although their small size makes it difficult to see each microvillus , their combined microscopic appearance suggests a mass of bristles , which is termed the brush border .

24,"As is the case with all body systems , the digestive system does not work in isolation ; it functions cooperatively with the other systems of the body . Consider for example , the interrelationship between the digestive and cardiovascular systems . Arteries supply the digestive organs with oxygen and processed nutrients , and veins drain the digestive tract . These intestinal veins , constituting the hepatic portal system , are unique ; they do not return blood directly to the heart . Rather , this blood is diverted to the liver where its nutrients are off-loaded for processing before blood completes its circuit back to the heart . At the same time , the digestive system provides nutrients to the heart muscle and vascular tissue to support their functioning . The interrelationship of the digestive and endocrine systems is also critical . Hormones secreted by several endocrine glands , as well as endocrine cells of the pancreas , the stomach , and the small intestine , contribute to the control of digestion and nutrient metabolism . In turn , the digestive system provides the nutrients to fuel endocrine function .

Therefore , chemical digestion in the large intestine occurs exclusively because of bacteria in the lumen of the colon .

This results in the discharge of hydrogen , carbon dioxide , and methane gases that create flatus ( gas ) in the colon ; flatulence is excessive flatus . Each day , up to 1500 mL of flatus is produced in the colon .

In between , however , it can be a highly active structure , contracting and continually changing position and size . These contractions provide mechanical assistance to digestion . The empty stomach is only about the size of your fist , but can stretch to hold as much as 4 liters of food and fluid , or more than 75 times its empty volume , and then return to its resting size when empty . Although you might think that the size of a person ’ s stomach is related to how much food that individual consumes , body weight does not correlate with stomach size .

In this type of transport , proteins within the cell membrane act as “ pumps , ” using cellular energy ( ATP ) to move the substance . Passive diffusion refers to the movement of substances from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration , while facilitated diffusion refers to the movement of substances from an area of higher to an area of lower concentration using a carrier protein in the cell membrane . Co-transport uses the movement of one molecule through the membrane from higher to lower concentration to power the movement of another from lower to higher .

24,"About 95 percent of lipids are absorbed in the small intestine . Bile salts not only speed up lipid digestion , they are also essential to the absorption of the end products of lipid digestion . Short-chain fatty acids are relatively water soluble and can enter the absorptive cells ( enterocytes ) directly . The small size of short-chain fatty acids enables them to be absorbed by enterocytes via simple diffusion , and then take the same path as monosaccharides and amino acids into the blood capillary of a villus . The large and hydrophobic long-chain fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are not so easily suspended in the watery intestinal chyme . However , bile salts and lecithin resolve this issue by enclosing them in a micelle , which is a tiny sphere with polar ( hydrophilic ) ends facing the watery environment and hydrophobic tails turned to the interior , creating a receptive environment for the long-chain fatty acids . The core also includes cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins . Without micelles , lipids would sit on the surface of chyme and never come in contact with the absorptive surfaces of the epithelial cells . Micelles can easily squeeze between microvilli and get very near the luminal cell surface . At this point , lipid substances exit the micelle and are absorbed via simple diffusion .",0.993410050868988,0.0

25,"View the University of Michigan WebScope to explore the tissue sample in greater detail . Intercalated discs are part of the sarcolemma and contain two structures important in cardiac muscle contraction : gap junctions and desmosomes . A gap junction forms channels between adjacent cardiac muscle fibers that allow the depolarizing current produced by cations to flow from one cardiac muscle cell to the next . This joining is called electric coupling , and in cardiac muscle it allows the quick transmission of action potentials and the coordinated contraction of the entire heart . This network of electrically connected cardiac muscle cells creates a functional unit of contraction called a syncytium . The remainder of the intercalated disc is composed of desmosomes . A desmosome is a cell structure that anchors the ends of cardiac muscle fibers together so the cells do not pull apart during the stress of individual fibers contracting ( Figure 10.22 ) . Contractions of the heart ( heartbeats ) are controlled by specialized cardiac muscle cells called pacemaker cells that directly control heart rate . Although cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled , the pacemaker cells respond to signals from the autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) to speed up or slow down the heart rate . The pacemaker cells can also respond to various hormones that modulate heart rate to control blood pressure .",0.9822909832000732,0.0

This allows the myosin heads to bind to these exposed binding sites and form cross-bridges . The thin filaments are then pulled by the myosin heads to slide past the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere .

25,"There is a wide range of motor units within many skeletal muscles , which gives the nervous system a wide range of control over the muscle . The small motor units in the muscle will have smaller , lower-threshold motor neurons that are more excitable , firing first to their skeletal muscle fibers , which also tend to be the smallest . Activation of these smaller motor units , results in a relatively small degree of contractile strength ( tension ) generated in the muscle . As more strength is needed , larger motor units , with bigger , higher-threshold motor neurons are enlisted to activate larger muscle fibers . This increasing activation of motor units produces an increase in muscle contraction known as recruitment . As more motor units are recruited , the muscle contraction grows progressively stronger . In some muscles , the largest motor units may generate a contractile force of 50 times more than the smallest motor units in the muscle . This allows a feather to be picked up using the biceps brachii arm muscle with minimal force , and a heavy weight to be lifted by the same muscle by recruiting the largest motor units .",0.9967466592788696,0.0

Fast fibers hydrolyze ATP approximately twice as quickly as slow fibers , resulting in much quicker cross-bridge cycling ( which pulls the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomeres at a faster rate ) . The primary metabolic pathway used by a muscle fiber determines whether the fiber is classified as oxidative or glycolytic . If a fiber primarily produces ATP through aerobic pathways it is oxidative . More ATP can be produced during each metabolic cycle , making the fiber more resistant to fatigue . Glycolytic fibers primarily create ATP through anaerobic glycolysis , which produces less ATP per cycle . As a result , glycolytic fibers fatigue at a quicker rate .",0.11443346738815308,0.0
25,"The sequence of events that result in the contraction of an individual muscle fiber begins with a signal — the neurotransmitter , ACh — from the motor neuron innervating that fiber .

This triggers the release of calcium ions ( Ca + + ) from storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) . The Ca + + then initiates contraction , which is sustained by ATP ( Figure 10.8 ) . As long as Ca + + ions remain in the sarcoplasm to bind to troponin , which keeps the actin-binding sites “ unshielded , ” and as long as ATP is available to drive the cross-bridge cycling and the pulling of actin strands by myosin , the muscle fiber will continue to shorten to an anatomical limit .",0.6219646334648132,0.0

This length maximizes the overlap of actin-binding sites and myosin heads . If a sarcomere is stretched past this ideal length ( beyond 120 percent ) , thick and thin filaments do not overlap sufficiently , which results in less tension produced . If a sarcomere is shortened beyond 80 percent , the zone of overlap is reduced with the thin filaments jutting beyond the last of the myosin heads and shrinks the H zone , which is normally composed of myosin tails . Eventually , there is nowhere else for the thin filaments to go and the amount of tension is diminished . If the muscle is stretched to the point where thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all , no cross-bridges can be formed , and no tension is produced in that sarcomere .

Muscles also prevent excess movement of the bones and joints , maintaining skeletal stability and preventing skeletal structure damage or deformation . Joints can become misaligned or dislocated entirely by pulling on the associated bones ; muscles work to keep joints stable .

25,"Smooth muscle is organized in two ways : as single-unit smooth muscle , which is much more common ; and as multiunit smooth muscle . The two types have different locations in the body and have different characteristics . Single-unit muscle has its muscle fibers joined by gap junctions so that the muscle contracts as a single unit . This type of smooth muscle is found in the walls of all visceral organs except the heart ( which has cardiac muscle in its walls ) , and so it is commonly called visceral muscle . Because the muscle fibers are not constrained by the organization and stretchability limits of sarcomeres , visceral smooth muscle has a stress-relaxation response . This means that as the muscle of a hollow organ is stretched when it fills , the mechanical stress of the stretching will trigger contraction , but this is immediately followed by relaxation so that the organ does not empty its contents prematurely . This is important for hollow organs , such as the stomach or urinary bladder , which continuously expand as they fill . The smooth muscle around these organs also can maintain a muscle tone when the organ empties and shrinks , a feature that prevents “ flabbiness ” in the empty organ .

Although they do not have striations and sarcomeres , smooth muscle fibers do have actin and myosin contractile proteins , and thick and thin filaments . These thin filaments are anchored by dense bodies . A dense body is analogous to the Z-discs of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers and is fastened to the sarcolemma . Calcium ions are supplied by the SR in the fibers and by sequestration from the extracellular fluid through membrane indentations called calveoli . Because smooth muscle cells do not contain troponin , cross-bridge formation is not regulated by the troponin-tropomyosin complex but instead by the regulatory protein calmodulin . In a smooth muscle fiber , external Ca + + ions passing through opened calcium channels in the sarcolemma , and additional Ca + + released from SR , bind to calmodulin . The Ca + + - calmodulin complex then activates an enzyme called myosin ( light chain ) kinase , which , in turn , activates the myosin heads by phosphorylating them ( converting ATP to ADP and P i , with the P i attaching to the head ) . The heads can then attach to actin-binding sites and pull on the thin filaments . The thin filaments also are anchored to the dense bodies ; the structures invested in the inner membrane of the sarcolemma ( at adherens junctions ) that also have cord-like intermediate filaments attached to them . When the thin filaments slide past the thick filaments , they pull on the dense bodies , structures tethered to the sarcolemma , which then pull on the intermediate filaments networks throughout the sarcoplasm . This arrangement causes the entire muscle fiber to contract in a manner whereby the ends are pulled toward the center , causing the midsection to bulge in a corkscrew motion ( Figure 10.24 ) .",1.0114362239837646,0.0

The aerobic metabolism used by slow-twitch fibers allows them to maintain contractions over long periods . Endurance training modifies these slow fibers to make them even more efficient by producing more mitochondria to enable more aerobic metabolism and more ATP production . Endurance exercise can also increase the amount of myoglobin in a cell , as increased aerobic respiration increases the need for oxygen .

The high rates of ATP hydrolysis and cross-bridge formation in FG fibers result in powerful muscle contractions . Muscles used for power have a higher ratio of FG to SO / FO fibers , and trained athletes possess even higher levels of FG fibers in their muscles . Resistance exercise affects muscles by increasing the formation of myofibrils , thereby increasing the thickness of muscle fibers . This added structure causes hypertrophy , or the enlargement of muscles , exemplified by the large skeletal muscles seen in body builders and other athletes ( Figure 10.19 ) .

There are various causes of atrophy , including mechanical injury , disease , and age . After breaking a limb or undergoing surgery , muscle use is impaired and can lead to disuse atrophy . If the muscles are not exercised , this atrophy can lead to long-term muscle weakness . A stroke can also cause muscle impairment by interrupting neural stimulation to certain muscles . Without neural inputs , these muscles do not contract and thus begin to lose structural proteins . Exercising these muscles can help to restore muscle function and minimize functional impairments .

In fact , it is the loss of ATP that results in the rigor mortis observed soon after someone dies .

25,"Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body , and the body contains three types of muscle tissue : skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle ( Figure 10.2 ) . All three muscle tissues have some properties in common ; they all exhibit a quality called excitability as their plasma membranes can change their electrical states ( from polarized to depolarized ) and send an electrical wave called an action potential along the entire length of the membrane . While the nervous system can influence the excitability of cardiac and smooth muscle to some degree , skeletal muscle completely depends on signaling from the nervous system to work properly . On the other hand , both cardiac muscle and smooth muscle can respond to other stimuli , such as hormones and local stimuli . The muscles all begin the actual process of contracting ( shortening ) when a protein called actin is pulled by a protein called myosin . This occurs in striated muscle ( skeletal and cardiac ) after specific binding sites on the actin have been exposed in response to the interaction between calcium ions ( Ca + + ) and proteins ( troponin and tropomyosin ) that “ shield ” the actin-binding sites . Ca + + also is required for the contraction of smooth muscle , although its role is different : here Ca + + activates enzymes , which in turn activate myosin heads . All muscles require adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to continue the process of contracting , and they all relax when the Ca + + is removed and the actin-binding sites are re-shielded .",0.9877266883850098,1.0
25,"Muscle fatigue occurs when a muscle can no longer contract in response to signals from the nervous system . The exact causes of muscle fatigue are not fully known , although certain factors have been correlated with the decreased muscle contraction that occurs during fatigue . ATP is needed for normal muscle contraction , and as ATP reserves are reduced , muscle function may decline . This may be more of a factor in brief , intense muscle output rather than sustained , lower intensity efforts . Lactic acid buildup may lower intracellular pH , affecting enzyme and protein activity .

Somites give rise to myoblasts . A myoblast is a muscle-forming stem cell that migrates to different regions in the body and then fuse ( s ) to form a syncytium , or myotube . As a myotube is formed from many different myoblast cells , it contains many nuclei , but has a continuous cytoplasm .

25,"Intense muscle activity results in an oxygen debt , which is the amount of oxygen needed to compensate for ATP produced without oxygen during muscle contraction . Oxygen is required to restore ATP and creatine phosphate levels , convert lactic acid to pyruvic acid , and , in the liver , to convert lactic acid into glucose or glycogen . Other systems used during exercise also require oxygen , and all of these combined processes result in the increased breathing rate that occurs after exercise . Until the oxygen debt has been met , oxygen intake is elevated , even after exercise has stopped .",0.7867286801338196,0.0
25,"In skeletal muscles that work with tendons to pull on bones , the collagen in the three tissue layers ( the mysia ) intertwines with the collagen of a tendon . At the other end of the tendon , it fuses with the periosteum coating the bone . The tension created by contraction of the muscle fibers is then transferred though the mysia , to the tendon , and then to the periosteum to pull on the bone for movement of the skeleton . In other places , the mysia may fuse with a broad , tendon-like sheet called an aponeurosis , or to fascia , the connective tissue between skin and bones . The broad sheet of connective tissue in the lower back that the latissimus dorsi muscles ( the “ lats ” ) fuse into is an example of an aponeurosis .",0.9701576828956604,0.0
25,"In isotonic contractions , where the tension in the muscle stays constant , a load is moved as the length of the muscle changes ( shortens ) . There are two types of isotonic contractions : concentric and eccentric . A concentric contraction involves the muscle shortening to move a load . An example of this is the biceps brachii muscle contracting when a hand weight is brought upward with increasing muscle tension . As the biceps brachii contract , the angle of the elbow joint decreases as the forearm is brought toward the body . Here , the biceps brachii contracts as sarcomeres in its muscle fibers are shortening and cross-bridges form ; the myosin heads pull the actin . An eccentric contraction occurs as the muscle tension diminishes and the muscle lengthens . In this case , the hand weight is lowered in a slow and controlled manner as the amount of cross-bridges being activated by nervous system stimulation decreases . In this case , as tension is released from the biceps brachii , the angle of the elbow joint increases . Eccentric contractions are also used for movement and balance of the body .",0.9510772228240967,0.0
25,"If the frequency of motor neuron signaling increases , summation and subsequent muscle tension in the motor unit continues to rise until it reaches a peak point . The tension at this point is about three to four times greater than the tension of a single twitch , a state referred to as incomplete tetanus . During incomplete tetanus , the muscle goes through quick cycles of contraction with a short relaxation phase for each . If the stimulus frequency is so high that the relaxation phase disappears completely , contractions become continuous in a process called complete tetanus ( Figure 10.16 b ) .",0.983170747756958,0.0
25,"If done improperly , resistance training can lead to overuse injuries of the muscle , tendon , or bone . These injuries can occur if the load is too heavy or if the muscles are not given sufficient time between workouts to recover or if joints are not aligned properly during the exercises . Cellular damage to muscle fibers that occurs after intense exercise includes damage to the sarcolemma and myofibrils . This muscle damage contributes to the feeling of soreness after strenuous exercise , but muscles gain mass as this damage is repaired , and additional structural proteins are added to replace the damaged ones . Overworking skeletal muscles can also lead to tendon damage and even skeletal damage if the load is too great for the muscles to bear .",0.10725866258144379,0.0

In skeletal muscles , ACh receptors are initially present along most of the surface of the myoblasts , but spinal nerve innervation causes the release of growth factors that stimulate the formation of motor end-plates and NMJs .

25,"For thin filaments to continue to slide past thick filaments during muscle contraction , myosin heads must pull the actin at the binding sites , detach , re-cock , attach to more binding sites , pull , detach , re-cock , etc . This repeated movement is known as the cross-bridge cycle . This motion of the myosin heads is similar to the oars when an individual rows a boat : The paddle of the oars ( the myosin heads ) pull , are lifted from the water ( detach ) , repositioned ( re-cocked ) and then immersed again to pull ( Figure 10.11 ) . Each cycle requires energy , and the action of the myosin heads in the sarcomeres repetitively pulling on the thin filaments also requires energy , which is provided by ATP . Cross-bridge formation occurs when the myosin head attaches to the actin while adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and inorganic phosphate ( P i ) are still bound to myosin ( Figure 10.11 a , b ) . P i is then released , causing myosin to form a stronger attachment to the actin , after which the myosin head moves toward the M-line , pulling the actin along with it . As actin is pulled , the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M-line . This movement is called the power stroke , as movement of the thin filament occurs at this step ( Figure 10.11 c ) . In the absence of ATP , the myosin head will not detach from actin .",0.9047088027000427,0.0
25,"For effective strength training , the intensity of the exercise must continually be increased . For instance , continued weight lifting without increasing the weight of the load does not increase muscle size . To produce ever-greater results , the weights lifted must become increasingly heavier , making it more difficult for muscles to move the load . The muscle then adapts to this heavier load , and an even heavier load must be used if even greater muscle mass is desired .",0.1893375962972641,0.0
25,"FO fibers are sometimes called intermediate fibers because they possess characteristics that are intermediate between fast fibers and slow fibers . They produce ATP relatively quickly , more quickly than SO fibers , and thus can produce relatively high amounts of tension . They are oxidative because they produce ATP aerobically , possess high amounts of mitochondria , and do not fatigue quickly . However , FO fibers do not possess significant myoglobin , giving them a lighter color than the red SO fibers . FO fibers are used primarily for movements , such as walking , that require more energy than postural control but less energy than an explosive movement , such as sprinting . FO fibers are useful for this type of movement because they produce more tension than SO fibers but they are more fatigue-resistant than FG fibers .",1.0207197666168213,0.0
25,"FG fibers primarily use anaerobic glycolysis as their ATP source . They have a large diameter and possess high amounts of glycogen , which is used in glycolysis to generate ATP quickly to produce high levels of tension . Because they do not primarily use aerobic metabolism , they do not possess substantial numbers of mitochondria or significant amounts of myoglobin and therefore have a white color . FG fibers are used to produce rapid , forceful contractions to make quick , powerful movements . These fibers fatigue quickly , permitting them to only be used for short periods . Most muscles possess a mixture of each fiber type .

25,"Each skeletal muscle is an organ that consists of various integrated tissues . These tissues include the skeletal muscle fibers , blood vessels , nerve fibers , and connective tissue . Each skeletal muscle has three layers of connective tissue ( called “ mysia ” ) that enclose it and provide structure to the muscle as a whole , and also compartmentalize the muscle fibers within the muscle ( Figure 10.3 ) . Each muscle is wrapped in a sheath of dense , irregular connective tissue called the epimysium , which allows a muscle to contract and move powerfully while maintaining its structural integrity . The epimysium also separates muscle from other tissues and organs in the area , allowing the muscle to move independently . Inside each skeletal muscle , muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles , each called a fascicle , by a middle layer of connective tissue called the perimysium . This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs ; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle , or fascicle of the muscle .

The striations are visible with a light microscope under high magnification ( see Figure 10.2 ) . Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated structures that compose the skeletal muscle . Cardiac muscle fibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as one unit ( called a syncytium ) . Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle , the cytoplasm of a smooth muscle fiber ( which has only a single nucleus ) has a uniform , nonstriated appearance ( resulting in the name smooth muscle ) . However , the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less efficient . Smooth muscle in the walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to push blood through the circulatory system ; and smooth muscle in the skin , visceral organs , and internal passageways is essential for moving all materials through the body . 10.2 Skeletal Muscle Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",1.0042973756790161,1.0

25,"Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart . Highly coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood into the vessels of the circulatory system . Similar to skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle is striated and organized into sarcomeres , possessing the same banding organization as skeletal muscle ( Figure 10.21 ) . However , cardiac muscle fibers are shorter than skeletal muscle fibers and usually contain only one nucleus , which is located in the central region of the cell . Cardiac muscle fibers also possess many mitochondria and myoglobin , as ATP is produced primarily through aerobic metabolism . Cardiac muscle fibers cells also are extensively branched and are connected to one another at their ends by intercalated discs . An intercalated disc allows the cardiac muscle cells to contract in a wave-like pattern so that the heart can work as a pump .",1.006844162940979,1.0
25,"Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical , they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers . Skeletal muscle fibers can be quite large for human cells , with diameters up to 100 μ m and lengths up to 30 cm ( 11.8 in ) in the Sartorius of the upper leg . During early development , embryonic myoblasts , each with its own nucleus , fuse with up to hundreds of other myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers . Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes , permitting the production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle contraction . Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek sarco , which means “ flesh . ” The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called the sarcolemma , the cytoplasm is referred to as sarcoplasm , and the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum , which stores , releases , and retrieves calcium ions ( Ca + + ) is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) ( Figure 10.4 ) . As will soon be described , the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber is the sarcomere , a highly organized arrangement of the contractile myofilaments actin ( thin filament ) and myosin ( thick filament ) , along with other support proteins .",1.0038591623306274,1.0
25,"Because most smooth muscles must function for long periods without rest , their power output is relatively low , but contractions can continue without using large amounts of energy . Some smooth muscle can also maintain contractions even as Ca + + is removed and myosin kinase is inactivated / dephosphorylated . This can happen as a subset of cross-bridges between myosin heads and actin , called latch-bridges , keep the thick and thin filaments linked together for a prolonged period , and without the need for ATP . This allows for the maintaining of muscle “ tone ” in smooth muscle that lines arterioles and other visceral organs with very little energy expenditure .",0.993942379951477,0.0
25,"Because DMD is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin , it was thought that introducing healthy myoblasts into patients might be an effective treatment . Myoblasts are the embryonic cells responsible for muscle development , and ideally , they would carry healthy genes that could produce the dystrophin needed for normal muscle contraction . This approach has been largely unsuccessful in humans . A recent approach has involved attempting to boost the muscle ’ s production of utrophin , a protein similar to dystrophin that may be able to assume the role of dystrophin and prevent cellular damage from occurring . 10.4 Nervous System Control of Muscle Tension Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",1.0029001235961914,1.0
25,"As you have learned , every skeletal muscle fiber must be innervated by the axon terminal of a motor neuron in order to contract . Each muscle fiber is innervated by only one motor neuron . The actual group of muscle fibers in a muscle innervated by a single motor neuron is called a motor unit . The size of a motor unit is variable depending on the nature of the muscle .",0.7596848011016846,0.0
25,"As the ATP produced by creatine phosphate is depleted , muscles turn to glycolysis as an ATP source . Glycolysis is an anaerobic ( non-oxygen-dependent ) process that breaks down glucose ( sugar ) to produce ATP ; however , glycolysis cannot generate ATP as quickly as creatine phosphate . Thus , the switch to glycolysis results in a slower rate of ATP availability to the muscle . The sugar used in glycolysis can be provided by blood glucose or by metabolizing glycogen that is stored in the muscle . The breakdown of one glucose molecule produces two ATP and two molecules of pyruvic acid , which can be used in aerobic respiration or when oxygen levels are low , converted to lactic acid ( Figure 10.12 b ) . If oxygen is available , pyruvic acid is used in aerobic respiration . However , if oxygen is not available , pyruvic acid is converted to lactic acid , which may contribute to muscle fatigue . This conversion allows the recycling of the enzyme NAD + from NADH , which is needed for glycolysis to continue . This occurs during strenuous exercise when high amounts of energy are needed but oxygen cannot be sufficiently delivered to muscle . Glycolysis itself cannot be sustained for very long ( approximately 1 minute of muscle activity ) , but it is useful in facilitating short bursts of high-intensity output . This is because glycolysis does not utilize glucose very efficiently , producing a net gain of two ATPs per molecule of glucose , and the end product of lactic acid , which may contribute to muscle fatigue as it accumulates .",0.9857636094093323,1.0
25,"As muscle cells die , they are not regenerated but instead are replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue , which do not possess the contractile abilities of muscle tissue . Muscles atrophy when they are not used , and over time if atrophy is prolonged , muscle cells die . It is therefore important that those who are susceptible to muscle atrophy exercise to maintain muscle function and prevent the complete loss of muscle tissue . In extreme cases , when movement is not possible , electrical stimulation can be introduced to a muscle from an external source . This acts as a substitute for endogenous neural stimulation , stimulating the muscle to contract and preventing the loss of proteins that occurs with a lack of use .",0.7030863761901855,0.0
25,Another specialization of the skeletal muscle is the site where a motor neuron ’ s terminal meets the muscle fiber — called the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) . This is where the muscle fiber first responds to signaling by the motor neuron . Every skeletal muscle fiber in every skeletal muscle is innervated by a motor neuron at the NMJ . Excitation signals from the neuron are the only way to functionally activate the fiber to contract .,0.40817904472351074,0.0
25,"Another feature of cardiac muscle is its relatively long action potentials in its fibers , having a sustained depolarization “ plateau . ” The plateau is produced by Ca + + entry though voltage-gated calcium channels in the sarcolemma of cardiac muscle fibers . This sustained depolarization ( and Ca + + entry ) provides for a longer contraction than is produced by an action potential in skeletal muscle . Unlike skeletal muscle , a large percentage of the Ca + + that initiates contraction in cardiac muscles comes from outside the cell rather than from the SR . 10.8 Smooth Muscle Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",1.0134339332580566,0.0
25,"An isometric contraction occurs as the muscle produces tension without changing the angle of a skeletal joint . Isometric contractions involve sarcomere shortening and increasing muscle tension , but do not move a load , as the force produced cannot overcome the resistance provided by the load . For example , if one attempts to lift a hand weight that is too heavy , there will be sarcomere activation and shortening to a point , and ever-increasing muscle tension , but no change in the angle of the elbow joint . In everyday living , isometric contractions are active in maintaining posture and maintaining bone and joint stability . However , holding your head in an upright position occurs not because the muscles cannot move the head , but because the goal is to remain stationary and not produce movement . Most actions of the body are the result of a combination of isotonic and isometric contractions working together to produce a wide range of outcomes ( Figure 10.13 ) .",0.9987077713012695,0.0
25,"Although the number of muscle cells is set during development , satellite cells help to repair skeletal muscle cells . A satellite cell is similar to a myoblast because it is a type of stem cell ; however , satellite cells are incorporated into muscle cells and facilitate the protein synthesis required for repair and growth . These cells are located outside the sarcolemma and are stimulated to grow and fuse with muscle cells by growth factors that are released by muscle fibers under certain forms of stress . Satellite cells can regenerate muscle fibers to a very limited extent , but they primarily help to repair damage in living cells . If a cell is damaged to a greater extent than can be repaired by satellite cells , the muscle fibers are replaced by scar tissue in a process called fibrosis . Because scar tissue cannot contract , muscle that has sustained significant damage loses strength and cannot produce the same amount of power or endurance as it could before being damaged .",1.0180985927581787,1.0
25,"Although smooth muscle contraction relies on the presence of Ca + + ions , smooth muscle fibers have a much smaller diameter than skeletal muscle cells . T-tubules are not required to reach the interior of the cell and therefore not necessary to transmit an action potential deep into the fiber . Smooth muscle fibers have a limited calcium-storing SR but have calcium channels in the sarcolemma ( similar to cardiac muscle fibers ) that open during the action potential along the sarcolemma . The influx of extracellular Ca + + ions , which diffuse into the sarcoplasm to reach the calmodulin , accounts for most of the Ca + + that triggers contraction of a smooth muscle cell .",0.9964586496353149,0.0
25,"Although performance-enhancing substances often do improve performance , most are banned by governing bodies in sports and are illegal for nonmedical purposes . Their use to enhance performance raises ethical issues of cheating because they give users an unfair advantage over nonusers . A greater concern , however , is that their use carries serious health risks . The side effects of these substances are often significant , nonreversible , and in some cases fatal . The physiological strain caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can handle , leading to effects that are unpredictable and dangerous . Anabolic steroid use has been linked to infertility , aggressive behavior , cardiovascular disease , and brain cancer .",0.908046305179596,0.0
25,"Although atrophy due to disuse can often be reversed with exercise , muscle atrophy with age , referred to as sarcopenia , is irreversible . This is a primary reason why even highly trained athletes succumb to declining performance with age . This decline is noticeable in athletes whose sports require strength and powerful movements , such as sprinting , whereas the effects of age are less noticeable in endurance athletes such as marathon runners or long-distance cyclists . As muscles age , muscle fibers die , and they are replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue ( Figure 10.20 ) . Because those tissues cannot contract and generate force as muscle can , muscles lose the ability to produce powerful contractions . The decline in muscle mass causes a loss of strength , including the strength required for posture and mobility . This may be caused by a reduction in FG fibers that hydrolyze ATP quickly to produce short , powerful contractions . Muscles in older people sometimes possess greater numbers of SO fibers , which are responsible for longer contractions and do not produce powerful movements . There may also be a reduction in the size of motor units , resulting in fewer fibers being stimulated and less muscle tension being produced .",0.7380683422088623,0.0
25,"Although a person can experience a muscle “ twitch , ” a single twitch does not produce any significant muscle activity in a living body . A series of action potentials to the muscle fibers is necessary to produce a muscle contraction that can produce work . Normal muscle contraction is more sustained , and it can be modified by input from the nervous system to produce varying amounts of force ; this is called a graded muscle response . The frequency of action potentials ( nerve impulses ) from a motor neuron and the number of motor neurons transmitting action potentials both affect the tension produced in skeletal muscle .",0.9775542616844177,0.0
25,"All of these muscle activities are under the exquisite control of the nervous system .

A crucial aspect of nervous system control of skeletal muscles is the role of motor units .",0.7228250503540039,0.0
25,"All living cells have membrane potentials , or electrical gradients across their membranes . The inside of the membrane is usually around - 60 to - 90 mV , relative to the outside . This is referred to as a cell ’ s membrane potential . Neurons and muscle cells can use their membrane potentials to generate electrical signals . They do this by controlling the movement of charged particles , called ions , across their membranes to create electrical currents . This is achieved by opening and closing specialized proteins in the membrane called ion channels . Although the currents generated by ions moving through these channel proteins are very small , they form the basis of both neural signaling and muscle contraction . Both neurons and skeletal muscle cells are electrically excitable , meaning that they are able to generate action potentials . An action potential is a special type of electrical signal that can travel along a cell membrane as a wave . This allows a signal to be transmitted quickly and faithfully over long distances . Although the term excitation-contraction coupling confuses or scares some students , it comes down to this : for a skeletal muscle fiber to contract , its membrane must first be “ excited ” — in other words , it must be stimulated to fire an action potential . The muscle fiber action potential , which sweeps along the sarcolemma as a wave , is “ coupled ” to the actual contraction through the release of calcium ions ( Ca + + ) from the SR . Once released , the Ca + + interacts with the shielding proteins , forcing them to move aside so that the actin-binding sites are available for attachment by myosin heads . The myosin then pulls the actin filaments toward the center , shortening the muscle fiber . In skeletal muscle , this sequence begins with signals from the somatic motor division of the nervous system . In other words , the “ excitation ” step in skeletal muscles is always triggered by signaling from the nervous system ( Figure 10.6 ) . The motor neurons that tell the skeletal muscle fibers to contract originate in the spinal cord , with a smaller number located in the brainstem for activation of skeletal muscles of the face , head , and neck . These neurons have long processes , called axons , which are specialized to transmit action potentials long distances — in this case , all the way from the spinal cord to the muscle itself ( which may be up to three feet away ) . The axons of multiple neurons bundle together to form nerves , like wires bundled together in a cable . Signaling begins when a neuronal action potential travels along the axon of a motor neuron , and then along the individual branches to terminate at the NMJ . At the NMJ , the axon terminal releases a chemical messenger , or neurotransmitter , called acetylcholine ( ACh ) . The ACh molecules diffuse across a minute space called the synaptic cleft and bind to ACh receptors located within the motor end-plate of the sarcolemma on the other side of the synapse . Once ACh binds , a channel in the ACh receptor opens and positively charged ions can pass through into the muscle fiber , causing it to depolarize , meaning that the membrane potential of the muscle fiber becomes less negative ( closer to zero . ) As the membrane depolarizes , another set of ion channels called voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered to open . Sodium ions enter the muscle fiber , and an action potential rapidly spreads ( or “ fires ” ) along the entire membrane to initiate excitation-contraction coupling . Things happen very quickly in the world of excitable membranes ( just think about how quickly you can snap your fingers as soon as you decide to do it ) . Immediately following depolarization of the membrane , it repolarizes , re-establishing the negative membrane potential . Meanwhile , the ACh in the synaptic cleft is degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) so that the ACh cannot rebind to a receptor and reopen its channel , which would cause unwanted extended muscle excitation and contraction . Propagation of an action potential along the sarcolemma is the excitation portion of excitation-contraction coupling . Recall that this excitation actually triggers the release of calcium ions ( Ca + + ) from its storage in the cell ’ s SR . For the action potential to reach the membrane of the SR , there are periodic invaginations in the sarcolemma , called T-tubules ( “ T ” stands for “ transverse ” ) . You will recall that the diameter of a muscle fiber can be up to 100 μ m , so these T-tubules ensure that the membrane can get close to the SR in the sarcoplasm . The arrangement of a T-tubule with the membranes of SR on either side is called a triad ( Figure 10.7 ) . The triad surrounds the cylindrical structure called a myofibril , which contains actin and myosin . The T-tubules carry the action potential into the interior of the cell , which triggers the opening of calcium channels in the membrane of the adjacent SR , causing Ca + + to diffuse out of the SR and into the sarcoplasm . It is the arrival of Ca + + in the sarcoplasm that initiates contraction of the muscle fiber by its contractile units , or sarcomeres . 10.3 Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9974636435508728,1.0
25,"Aerobic respiration is the breakdown of glucose or other nutrients in the presence of oxygen ( O 2 ) to produce carbon dioxide , water , and ATP . Approximately 95 percent of the ATP required for resting or moderately active muscles is provided by aerobic respiration , which takes place in mitochondria . The inputs for aerobic respiration include glucose circulating in the bloodstream , pyruvic acid , and fatty acids . Aerobic respiration is much more efficient than anaerobic glycolysis , producing approximately 36 ATPs per molecule of glucose versus four from glycolysis . However , aerobic respiration cannot be sustained without a steady supply of O 2 to the skeletal muscle and is much slower ( Figure 10.12 c ) . To compensate , muscles store small amount of excess oxygen in proteins call myoglobin , allowing for more efficient muscle contractions and less fatigue . Aerobic training also increases the efficiency of the circulatory system so that O 2 can be supplied to the muscles for longer periods of time .",1.0036311149597168,0.0
25,"ATP supplies the energy for muscle contraction to take place . In addition to its direct role in the cross-bridge cycle , ATP also provides the energy for the active-transport Ca + + pumps in the SR . Muscle contraction does not occur without sufficient amounts of ATP . The amount of ATP stored in muscle is very low , only sufficient to power a few seconds worth of contractions . As it is broken down , ATP must therefore be regenerated and replaced quickly to allow for sustained contraction . There are three mechanisms by which ATP can be regenerated : creatine phosphate metabolism , anaerobic glycolysis , and fermentation and aerobic respiration . Creatine phosphate is a molecule that can store energy in its phosphate bonds . In a resting muscle , excess ATP transfers its energy to creatine , producing ADP and creatine phosphate . This acts as an energy reserve that can be used to quickly create more ATP . When the muscle starts to contract and needs energy , creatine phosphate transfers its phosphate back to ADP to form ATP and creatine . This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase and occurs very quickly ; thus , creatine phosphate-derived ATP powers the first few seconds of muscle contraction . However , creatine phosphate can only provide approximately 15 seconds worth of energy , at which point another energy source has to be used ( Figure 10.12 ) .",0.9059593677520752,1.0

A twitch can last for a few milliseconds or 100 milliseconds , depending on the muscle type . The tension produced by a single twitch can be measured by a myogram , an instrument that measures the amount of tension produced over time ( Figure 10.15 ) . Each twitch undergoes three phases . The first phase is the latent period , during which the action potential is being propagated along the sarcolemma and Ca + + ions are released from the SR . This is the phase during which excitation and contraction are being coupled but contraction has yet to occur . The contraction phase occurs next . The Ca + + ions in the sarcoplasm have bound to troponin , tropomyosin has shifted away from actin-binding sites , cross-bridges formed , and sarcomeres are actively shortening to the point of peak tension . The last phase is the relaxation phase , when tension decreases as contraction stops . Ca + + ions are pumped out of the sarcoplasm into the SR , and cross-bridge cycling stops , returning the muscle fibers to their resting state .",0.9336599111557007,1.0

While abolitionists called for the end of slavery everywhere , antislavery advocates , for various reasons , did not challenge the presence of slavery in the states where it already existed . Those who supported antislavery fervently opposed its expansion westward because , they argued , slavery would degrade White labor and reduce its value , cast a stigma upon hard-working Whites , and deprive them of a chance to advance economically . The western lands , they argued , should be open to White men only — small farmers and urban workers for whom the West held the promise of economic advancement . Where slavery was entrenched , according to antislavery advocates , there was little land left for small farmers to purchase , and such men could not compete fairly with slaveholders who held large farms and gangs of enslaved people . Ordinary laborers suffered also ; no one would pay a White man a decent wage when an enslaved person worked for nothing . When labor was associated with loss of freedom , antislavery supporters argued , all White workers carried a stigma that marked them as little better than the enslaved . Wilmot opposed the extension of slavery into the Mexican Cession not because of his concern for African Americans , but because of his belief that slavery hurt White workers , and that lands acquired by the government should be used to better the position of White small farmers and laborers . Work was not simply something that people did ; it gave them dignity , but in a slave society , labor had no dignity . In response to these arguments , southerners maintained that laborers in northern factories were treated worse than enslaved people . Their work was tedious and low paid . Their meager income was spent on inadequate food , clothing , and shelter . There was no dignity in such a life .

27,"When stimulated by the T H 2 pathway , naïve B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells . A plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies ; these cells arise from B cells that were stimulated by antigens . Similar to T cells , naïve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors ( BCRs ) , which are membrane-bound forms of Ig ( immunoglobulin , or an antibody ) . The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages . Each chain has a constant and a variable region ; the latter is involved in antigen binding . Two other membrane proteins , Ig alpha and Ig beta , are involved in signaling . The receptors of any particular B cell , as shown in Figure 42.13 are all the same , but the hundreds of millions of different B cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types of molecular structures to which they can bind . In this state , B cells function as APCs . They bind and engulf foreign antigens via their BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to T H 2 cells . When a T H 2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen , it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly , which makes thousands of identical ( clonal ) copies of it , and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs . The activation of B cells corresponding to one specific BCR variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection . This phenomenon drastically , but briefly , changes the proportions of BCR variants expressed by the immune system , and shifts the balance toward BCRs specific to the infecting pathogen .",1.0170992612838745,0.0

This process can take decades , can cost millions of dollars , and can involve many obstacles along the way . For instance , injected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system , eliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity , but have little effect on the mucosal response , which presents a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal compartments , and the injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents . For this reason , vaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal , aerosol , oral , or transcutaneous ( absorbed through the skin ) delivery methods .

27,"The term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined , multivalent structures ( such as IgM and IgA ) . Although avidity measures the strength of binding , just as affinity does , the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure . The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being detected , as well as other physical and chemical factors . Typically , multimeric antibodies , such as pentameric IgM , are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies , but high avidity . Essentially , the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind many antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody / antigen interaction .",1.0161857604980469,0.0
27,"The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens , and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens . An antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) is an immune cell that detects , engulfs , and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection . When a pathogen is detected , these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen . Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC , where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells . Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material ; they are present in the skin ( Langerhans cells ) and the lining of the nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines . Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response , thus functioning as an antigen-presenting cell . Macrophages also function as APCs . Before activation and differentiation , B cells can also function as APCs .",1.0130523443222046,1.0
27,"The innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system ( affecting the whole body ) , which is distinct from the mucosal immune system . Mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue , which functions independently of the systemic immune system , and which has its own innate and adaptive components . Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) , illustrated in Figure 42.15 , is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body . This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment . The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types . Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue . M cells function in the transport described , and are located in the Peyer ’ s patch , a lymphoid nodule . APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells , with B cells and macrophages having minor roles . Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites , such as the tonsils , adenoids , appendix , or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine . Activated T cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection .",1.0154510736465454,0.0
27,"The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful , unnecessary responses to harmless substances , and more importantly so that it does not attack “ self . ” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance . Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter . Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver , lymph nodes , small intestine , and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T ( T reg ) cells , specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors . The combined result of T reg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead . In addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens , other subsets of T reg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response , which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self-antigens . Another T reg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis .",1.0130391120910645,1.0
27,"The immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses . Innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology ; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response . Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins , receptor-mediated signaling , and intricate cell-to-cell communication . The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution , roughly a billion years ago , as an essential response to infection . Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets : any pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response . For example , tears and mucus secretions contain microbicidal factors .",1.0131139755249023,0.0
27,"The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy . In the United States , 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma , whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens . Upon initial exposure to a potential allergen , an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to T H cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE . This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms . The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues . This process primes , or sensitizes , the tissue . Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen , IgE molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin ; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses . Figure 42.26 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen . The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy , watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives , airway contraction with severe respiratory distress , and plummeting blood pressure . This extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock . If not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects , this condition can be fatal .",0.98658686876297,1.0

The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen . Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis . A neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens . Neutrophils , shown in Figure 42.3 , are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system . Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes , and they contain organelles , called lysosomes , that digest engulfed pathogens .

27,"The adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon reinvasion of the same pathogen . Memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the innate response . During the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before , called a primary response , plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated T cells increase , then plateau over time .

27,"The adaptive , or acquired , immune response takes days or even weeks to become established — much longer than the innate response ; however , adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory . Adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination . This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection . In fact , without information from the innate immune system , the adaptive response could not be mobilized . There are two types of adaptive responses : the cell-mediated immune response , which is carried out by T cells , and the humoral immune response , which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies . Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen . Their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and disrupt the infection . Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with long-term protection from reinfection with the same type of pathogen ; on re-exposure , this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick response .",1.0189177989959717,0.0

27,"The T H lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system . These cells are important for extracellular infections , such as those caused by certain bacteria , helminths , and protozoa . T H lymphocytes recognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs . There are two major populations of T H cells : T H 1 and T H 2 . T H 1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells . T H 1 cells activate the action of cyotoxic T cells , as well as macrophages . T H 2 cells stimulate naïve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion . Whether a T H 1 or a T H 2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system , which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen . The T H 1 - mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation . Recall the frontline defenses of macrophages involved in the innate immune response . Some intracellular bacteria , such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , have evolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed . These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy and digest the pathogen . When M . tuberculosis infection occurs , macrophages can stimulate naïve T cells to become T H 1 cells . These stimulated T cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive capabilities and allow it to destroy the colonizing M . tuberculosis . In the same manner , T H 1 - activated macrophages also become better suited to ingest and kill tumor cells .

Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen . T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens , called epitopes , presented by APCs , illustrated in Figure 42.10 . Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen ; for this reason , epitopes are known as “ antigenic determinants . ” In the absence of information from APCs , T and B cells remain inactive , or naïve , and are unable to prepare an immune response .

T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes . T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow . NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells . MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells , thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated . The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins from the infectious agents within the cell to T-cells ; healthy cells will be ignored , while “ non-self ” or foreign proteins will be attacked by the immune system . MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens ( “ non-self proteins ” ) and on lymphocytes . MHC II molecules interact with helper T-cells to trigger the appropriate immune response , which may include the inflammatory response . An infected cell ( or a tumor cell ) is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC I molecules appropriately . The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and / or trafficking to the cell surface .

This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface , which NK cells detect as “ unhealthy ” or “ abnormal ” while searching for cellular MHC I molecules .

Delayed hypersensitivity facilitates the immune response to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results in a small region of inflammation on individuals who were previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis . That is also why cortisone is used to treat such responses : it will inhibit cytokine production .,1.01827871799469,0.0

Patients who develop systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own DNA .

27,"Consider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime . The mammalian adaptive immune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen . Mammals have an enormous diversity of T cell populations , resulting from the diversity of TCRs . Each TCR consists of two polypeptide chains that span the T cell membrane , as illustrated in Figure 42.12 ; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge . Each polypeptide chain is comprised of a constant domain and a variable domain : a domain , in this sense , is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or structural . The intracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling . A single T cell will express thousands of identical copies of one specific TCR variant on its cell surface . The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it synthesizes millions of different T cell populations , each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain . This TCR diversity is achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of T cells . The binding between an antigen-displaying MHC molecule and a complementary TCR “ match ” indicates that the adaptive immune system needs to activate and produce that specific T cell because its structure is appropriate to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen .",0.9232645630836487,0.0

27,"Chapter Outline 42.1 Innate Immune Response 42.2 Adaptive Immune Response 42.3 Antibodies 42.4 Disruptions in the Immune System Introduction The environment consists of numerous pathogens , which are agents , usually microorganisms , that cause diseases in their hosts . A host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen . Pathogens include bacteria , protists , fungi and other infectious organisms . We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water , on surfaces , and in the air . Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens ; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents . Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens . When pathogens are found , immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection . The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen , strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently , and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage . The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure . This memory can last several decades . Features of the immune system , such as pathogen identification , specific response , amplification , retreat , and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens . The immune response can be classified as either innate or active . The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones . Conversely , the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses .",0.9952394962310791,0.0

27,"CTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs . Binding of TCRs with antigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme , degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected cell . Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells . In this process , the CTL does not become infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes . In fact , the functions of NK cells and CTLs are complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells , as illustrated in Figure 42.14 . If the NK cell cannot identify the “ missing self ” pattern of down-regulated MHC I molecules , then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I with foreign antigens , which signals “ altered self . ” Similarly , if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because the receptors are depleted from the cell surface , NK cells will destroy the cell instead . CTLs also emit cytokines , such as interferons , that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells , such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed . Moreover , these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles .",0.8857124447822571,1.0
27,"CTLs , a subclass of T cells , function to clear infections directly . The cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system consists of CTLs that attack and destroy infected cells . CTLs are particularly important in protecting against viral infections ; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating antibodies . When APCs phagocytize pathogens and present MHC I-embedded antigens to naïve CD8 + T cells that express complementary TCRs , the CD8 + T cells become activated to proliferate according to clonal selection . These resulting CTLs then identify non-APCs displaying the same MHC I-embedded antigens ( for example , viral proteins ) — for example , the CTLs identify infected host cells .",1.0144063234329224,0.0
27,"Before any immune factors are triggered , the skin functions as a continuous , impassable barrier to potentially infectious pathogens . Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation ( drying out ) and by the skin ’ s acidity . In addition , beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens , preventing infection . Regions of the body that are not protected by skin ( such as the eyes and mucus membranes ) have alternative methods of defense , such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens , and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of the body . Throughout the body are other defenses , such as the low pH of the stomach ( which inhibits the growth of pathogens ) , blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes , and the process of urination ( which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract ) .",0.4401593506336212,1.0

Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies . In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis , muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies . The result is muscle weakness that may include marked difficultly with fine and / or gross motor functions . In systemic lupus erythematosus , a diffuse autoantibody response to the individual ’ s own DNA and proteins results in various systemic diseases .

As an example , infection with Streptococcus pyogenes ( bacterium that causes strep throat ) may generate antibodies or T cells that react with heart muscle , which has a similar structure to the surface of S . pyogenes . These antibodies can damage heart muscle with autoimmune attacks , leading to rheumatic fever .

IgGs , which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies , have heavy chains that consist of one variable domain and three identical constant domains . IgA and IgD also have three constant domains per heavy chain , whereas IgM and IgE each have four constant domains per heavy chain .

27,"An infection may be intracellular or extracellular , depending on the pathogen . All viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells ( intracellularly ) , whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly , depending on the species . The innate immune system must respond accordingly : by identifying the extracellular pathogen and / or by identifying host cells that have already been infected . When a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) on the pathogen ’ s surface . PAMPs are carbohydrate , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ signatures ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells . The immune system has specific cells , described in Figure 42.2 and shown in Figure 42.3 , with receptors that recognize these PAMPs . A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens . Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) . PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment . A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue . Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction . Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules ) . TLRs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates , and appear to be one of the most ancient components of the immune system . TLRs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system . Cytokine Release Effect The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines , which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells . A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation ( form and function ) , proliferation ( production ) , and gene expression to affect immune responses . At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them , the cell type that responds to them , and the changes they produce . One type cytokine , interferon , is illustrated in Figure 42.4 . One subclass of cytokines is the interleukin ( IL ) , so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes ( white blood cells ) . Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses . In addition to being released from cells after PAMP recognition , cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines , which results in a cytokine burst .",1.0028077363967896,1.0

Cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously ; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms . The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system . Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies . Binding of complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence , with each successive protein being activated by cleavage and / or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein ( s ) . After the first few complement proteins bind , a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins .",1.0179263353347778,0.0

Within the phagolysosome , the components are broken down into fragments ; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation , as illustrated in Figure 42.8 . Note that T lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule . APCs express MHC on their surfaces , and when combined with a foreign antigen , these complexes signal a “ non-self ” invader . Once the fragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule , the immune cell can respond . Helper T - cells are one of the main lymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells .

27,"A functioning immune system is essential for survival , but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses of the mammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step . In the competition between immune protection and pathogen evasion , pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation time and other characteristics . For instance , Streptococcus pneumoniae ( bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis ) surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system . Staphylococcus aureus ( bacterium that can cause skin infections , abscesses , and meningitis ) synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium . Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system . HIV infects T H cells via their CD4 surface molecules , gradually depleting the number of T H cells in the body ; this inhibits the adaptive immune system ’ s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors . As a result , HIV-infected individuals often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause devastating illness to immune-compromised individuals .

28,"The other medically important group of platyhelminths are commonly known as tapeworms ( cestodes ) and are segmented flatworms that may have suckers or hooks at the scolex ( head region ) ( Figure 5.21 ) . Tapeworms use these suckers or hooks to attach to the wall of the small intestine . The body of the worm is made up of segments called proglottid s that contain reproductive structures ; these detach when the gametes are fertilized , releasing gravid proglottids with eggs . Tapeworms often have an intermediate host that consumes the eggs , which then hatch into a larval form called an oncosphere . The oncosphere migrates to a particular tissue or organ in the intermediate host , where it forms cysticerci . After being eaten by the definitive host , the cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms in the host's digestive system ( Figure 5.23 ) . Taenia saginata ( the beef tapeworm ) and T . solium ( the pork tapeworm ) enter humans through ingestion of undercooked , contaminated meat . The adult worms develop and reside in the intestine , but the larval stage may migrate and be found in other body locations such as skeletal and smooth muscle . The beef tapeworm is relatively benign , although it can cause digestive problems and , occasionally , allergic reactions . The pork tapeworm can cause more serious problems when the larvae leave the intestine and colonize other tissues , including those of the central nervous system .

The representatives in those districts are under very little pressure to consider the interests of minority groups . As a result , they typically do not . 2",0.09886842221021652,1.0
29,"While the strangely drawn districts succeeded in their stated goals , nearly quintupling the number of African American representatives in Congress in just over two decades , they have frustrated others who claim they are merely a new form of an old practice , gerrymandering . Gerrymandering is the manipulation of legislative district boundaries as a way of favoring a particular candidate . The term combines the word salamander , a reference to the strange shape of these districts , with the name of Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry , who in 1812 , signed a redistricting plan designed to benefit his party . Despite the questionable ethics behind gerrymandering , the practice is legal , and both major parties have used it to their benefit . It is only when political redistricting appears to dilute the votes of racial minorities that gerrymandering efforts can be challenged under the Voting Rights Act . Other forms of gerrymandering are frequently employed in states where a dominant party seeks to maintain that domination . As we saw in the chapter on political parties , gerrymandering can be a tactic to draw district lines in a way that creates “ safe seats ” for a particular political party . In states like Maryland , these are safe seats for Democrats . In states like Louisiana , they are safe seats for Republicans ( Figure 11.4 ) .",1.013696551322937,0.0

And the name is appropriate , since a senator who launches a filibuster virtually hijacks the floor of the chamber by speaking for long periods of time , thus preventing the Senate from closing debate and acting on a bill . The tactic was perfected in the 1850s as Congress wrestled with the complicated issue of slavery . After the Civil War , the use of the filibuster became even more common . Eventually , in 1917 , the Senate passed Rule 22 , which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate . To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two-thirds majority . This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’ s record twenty-four-hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act . In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty-five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .

Each of these powers also grants Congress oversight of the actions of the president and his or her administration — that is , the right to review and monitor other bodies such as the executive branch . The fact that Congress has the sole power to introduce legislation effectively limits the power of the president to develop the same laws he or she is empowered to enforce . The Senate ’ s exclusive power to give final approval for many of the president ’ s nominees , including cabinet members and judicial appointments , compels the president to consider the needs and desires of Congress when selecting top government officials . Finally , removing a president from office who has been elected by the entire country should never be done lightly . Giving this responsibility to a large deliberative body of elected officials ensures it will occur only very rarely .",0.9941229224205017,0.0

As the country sank into recession and Congress tried to use spending bills to stimulate the economy , the public grew more acutely aware of its earmarking habits . Congresspersons then were eager to distance themselves from the practice .

He proposed that the reason was a surge in political stimulation during presidential elections , which contributes to greater turnout and brings in voters who are ordinarily less interested in politics . These voters , Campbell argued , tend to favor the party holding the presidency . In contrast , midterm elections witness the opposite effect . They are less stimulating and have lower turnout because less-interested voters stay home .

Indeed , a presentation for incoming Democratic representatives suggested a daily Washington schedule of five hours reaching out to donors , while only three or four were to be used for actual congressional work . As this advice reveals , raising money for reelection constitutes a large proportion of the work a congressperson does . This has caused many to wonder whether the amount of money in politics has truly become a corrupting influence .

Nor was Thurmond the first to use the filibuster to preserve segregation and prevent the expansion of civil rights for African Americans . Groups of dedicated southern senators used the filibuster to prevent the passage of anti-lynching legislation on multiple occasions during the first half of the twentieth century . Later , when faced with the 1964 Civil Rights Act , southern senators staged a fifty-seven-day filibuster to try and kill it . But the momentum of the nation was against them .

According to political scientist Barbara Sinclair , the primary trigger for the shift away from the classic legislative route was the budget reforms of the 1970s . The 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act gave Congress a mechanism for making large , all-encompassing , budget decisions . In the years that followed , the budget process gradually became the vehicle for creating comprehensive policy changes .

Congress members ’ most important function as lawmakers is writing , supporting , and passing bills . And as representatives of their constituents , they are charged with addressing those constituents ’ interests . Historically , this job has included what some have affectionately called “ bringing home the bacon ” but what many ( usually those outside the district in question ) call pork-barrel politics . As a term and a practice , pork-barrel politics — federal spending on projects designed to benefit a particular district or set of constituents — has been around since the nineteenth century , when barrels of salt pork were both a sign of wealth and a system of reward . While pork-barrel politics are often deplored during election campaigns , and earmarks — funds appropriated for specific projects — are no longer permitted in Congress ( see feature box below ) , legislative control of local appropriations nevertheless still exists . In more formal language , allocation , or the influencing of the national budget in ways that help the district or state , can mean securing funds for a specific district ’ s project like an airport , or getting tax breaks for certain types of agriculture or manufacturing .

Unlike “ hard money ” contributed directly to a candidate , which is heavily regulated and limited , soft money had almost no regulations or limits .

Because both systems are open to the external environment , they are prone to infections . Some infections are introduced from outside , whereas others result from imbalances in the microbiota of the urogenital tract . Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) are one the most common bacterial infections worldwide , affecting over 100 million people each year . During 2007 in the United States , doctor office visits for UTIs exceeded 10 million , and an additional 2 – 3 million emergency department visits were attributed to UTIs . Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) also primarily affect the urogenital system and are an important cause of patient morbidity . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates that there are approximately 20 million new cases of reportable STIs annually in the United States , half of which occur in people aged 15 – 24 years old . When STIs spread to the reproductive organs , they can be associated with severe morbidity and loss of fertility . Because males and females have different urogenital anatomy , urogenital infections may affect males and females differently . In this chapter , we will discuss the various microbes that cause urogenital disease and the factors that contribute to their pathogenicity .",0.9563535451889038,0.0

Although most persons infected with C . trachomatis are asymptomatic , some patients can present with NGU . C . trachomatis can also cause non-urogenital infections such as the ocular disease trachoma ( see Bacterial Infections of the Skin and Eyes ) . The life cycle of C . trachomatis is illustrated in Figure 4.12 . C . trachomatis has multiple possible virulence factors that are currently being studied to evaluate their roles in causing disease . These include polymorphic outer-membrane autotransporter proteins , stress response proteins , and type III secretion effectors . The type III secretion effectors have been identified in gram-negative pathogens , including C . trachomatis . This virulence factor is an assembly of more than 20 proteins that form what is called an injectisome for the transfer of other effector proteins that target the infected host cells . The outer-membrane autotransporter proteins are also an effective mechanism of delivering virulence factors involved in colonization , disease progression , and immune system evasion .",1.0003480911254883,0.0

30,"Below the bladder , the normal microbiota of the male urogenital system is found primarily within the distal urethra and includes bacterial species that are commonly associated with the skin microbiota . In women , the normal microbiota is found within the distal one third of the urethra and the vagina . The normal microbiota of the vagina becomes established shortly after birth and is a complex and dynamic population of bacteria that fluctuates in response to environmental changes . Members of the vaginal microbiota play an important role in the nonspecific defense against vaginal infections and sexually transmitted infections by occupying cellular binding sites and competing for nutrients . In addition , the production of lactic acid by members of the microbiota provides an acidic environment within the vagina that also serves as a defense against infections . For the majority of women , the lactic-acid – producing bacteria in the vagina are dominated by a variety of species of Lactobacillus . For women who lack sufficient lactobacilli in their vagina , lactic acid production comes primarily from other species of bacteria such as Leptotrichia spp . , Megasphaera spp . , and Atopobium vaginae . Lactobacillus spp . use glycogen from vaginal epithelial cells for metabolism and production of lactic acid . This process is tightly regulated by the hormone estrogen . Increased levels of estrogen correlate with increased levels of vaginal glycogen , increased production of lactic acid , and a lower vaginal pH . Therefore , decreases in estrogen during the menstrual cycle and with menopause are associated with decreased levels of vaginal glycogen and lactic acid , and a higher pH . In addition to producing lactic acid , Lactobacillus spp . also contribute to the defenses against infectious disease through their production of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins ( antibacterial peptides ) .",1.0098155736923218,0.0

Bacterial infections of the vagina are called bacterial vaginosis , whereas fungal infections ( typically involving Candida spp . ) are called yeast infection s .

Since then , psychological and physiological professionals have increasingly used the term gender ( Moi 2005 ) .

In an effort to clarify usage of the terms sex and gender , U . S .

That is to say , gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine is to male ” ( J . E . B . v . Alabama , 144 S . Ct . 1436 [ 1994 ] ) . Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a different take , however .

Between 2004 and 2010 , five states and the District of Columbia legalized gay marriage . The Employee Non-Discrimination Act , which ensures workplace equality regardless of sexual orientation , is still pending full government approval . Organizations such as GLAAD ( Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ) advocate for homosexual rights and encourage governments and citizens to recognize the presence of sexual discrimination and work to prevent it . Other advocacy agencies frequently use the acronyms LBGT and LBGTQ , which stands for “ Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender ” ( and “ Queer ” or “ Questioning ” when the Q is added ) .",0.2887606918811798,0.0

31,"Mimicking the actions of significant others is the first step in the development of a separate sense of self ( Mead 1934 ) . Like adults , children become agents who actively facilitate and apply normative gender expectations to those around them . When children do not conform to the appropriate gender role , they may face negative sanctions such as being criticized or marginalized by their peers . Though many of these sanctions are informal , they can be quite severe . For example , a girl who wishes to take karate class instead of dance lessons may be called a “ tomboy ” and face difficulty gaining acceptance from both male and female peer groups ( Ready 2001 ) .

This same inequality is pervasive in children ’ s movies ( Smith 2008 ) . Research indicates that of the 101 top-grossing G-rated movies released between 1990 and 2005 , three out of four characters were male .

31,"Later scholarship by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick expanded on Kinsey ’ s notions . She coined the term “ homosocial ” to oppose “ homosexual , ” describing non-sexual same-sex relations . Sedgwick recognized that in American culture , males are subject to a clear divide between the two sides of this continuum , whereas females enjoy more fluidity . This can be illustrated by the way women in America can express homosocial feelings ( nonsexual regard for people of the same sex ) through hugging , handholding , and physical closeness . In contrast , American males refrain from these expressions since they violate the heteronormative expectation . While women experience a flexible norming of variations of behavior that spans the heterosocial-homosocial spectrum , male behavior is subject to strong social sanction if it veers into homosocial territory because of societal homophobia ( Sedgwick 1985 ) .",0.9557805061340332,0.0

31,"Interactionists are also interested in how discussions of homosexuals often focus almost exclusively on the sex lives of gays and lesbians ; homosexuals , especially men , may be assumed to be hypersexual and , in some cases , deviant . Interactionism might also focus on the slurs used to describe homosexuals . Labels such as “ queen ” and “ fag ” are often used to demean homosexual men by feminizing them . This subsequently affects how homosexuals perceive themselves . Recall Cooley ’ s “ looking-glass self , ” which suggests that self develops as a result of one ’ s interpretation and evaluation of the responses of others ( Cooley 1902 ) . Constant exposure to derogatory labels , jokes , and pervasive homophobia would lead to a negative self-image , or worse , self-hate .

According to George Murdock ’ s classic work , Outline of World Cultures ( 1954 ) , all societies classify work by gender . When a pattern appears in all societies , it is called a cultural universal . While the phenomenon of assigning work by gender is universal , its specifics are not . The same task is not assigned to either men or women worldwide . But the way each task ’ s associated gender is valued is notable . In Murdock ’ s examination of the division of labor among 324 societies around the world , he found that in nearly all cases the jobs assigned to men were given greater prestige ( Murdock and White 1968 ) .

31,"Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism . Sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex over another . Sexism varies in its level of severity . In parts of the world where women are strongly undervalued , young girls may not be given the same access to nutrition , healthcare , and education as boys . Further , they will grow up believing that they deserve to be treated differently from boys ( UNICEF 2011 ; Thorne 1993 ) . While illegal in the United States when practiced as discrimination , unequal treatment of women continues to pervade social life . It should be noted that discrimination based on sex occurs at both the micro - and macro-levels . Many sociologists focus on discrimination that is built into the social structure ; this type of discrimination is known as institutional discrimination ( Pincus 2008 ) . Gender socialization occurs through four major agents of socialization : family , education , peer groups , and mass media . Each agent reinforces gender roles by creating and maintaining normative expectations for gender-specific behavior . Exposure also occurs through secondary agents such as religion and the workplace . Repeated exposure to these agents over time leads men and women into a false sense that they are acting naturally rather than following a socially constructed role .",1.013466477394104,0.0
31,"Gender and Socialization The phrase “ boys will be boys ” is often used to justify behavior such as pushing , shoving , or other forms of aggression from young boys . The phrase implies that such behavior is unchangeable and something that is part of a boy ’ s nature . Aggressive behavior , when it does not inflict significant harm , is often accepted from boys and men because it is congruent with the cultural script for masculinity . The “ script ” written by society is in some ways similar to a script written by a playwright . Just as a playwright expects actors to adhere to a prescribed script , society expects women and men to behave according to the expectations of their respective gender role . Scripts are generally learned through a process known as socialization , which teaches people to behave according to social norms .",0.96206134557724,0.0
31,"Gender Roles As we grow , we learn how to behave from those around us . In this socialization process , children are introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex . The term gender role refers to society ’ s concept of how men and women are expected to act and how they should behave . These roles are based on norms , or standards , created by society . In American culture , masculine roles are usually associated with strength , aggression , and dominance , while feminine roles are usually associated with passivity , nurturing , and subordination . Role learning starts with socialization at birth . Even today , our society is quick to outfit male infants in blue and girls in pink , even applying these color-coded gender labels while a baby is in the womb .",1.0161888599395752,0.0

Social norms surrounding family life have , traditionally , encouraged sexual activity within the family unit ( marriage ) and have discouraged activity outside of it ( premarital and extramarital sex ) . From a functionalist point of view , the purpose of encouraging sexual activity in the confines of marriage is to intensify the bond between spouses and to ensure that procreation occurs within a stable , legally recognized relationship .

However , differential socialization typically results in greater privileges afforded to sons . For instance , boys are allowed more autonomy and independence at an earlier age than daughters . They may be given fewer restrictions on appropriate clothing , dating habits , or curfew .

For example , when dividing up household chores , boys may be asked to take out the garbage or perform other tasks that require strength or toughness , while girls may be asked to fold laundry or perform duties that require neatness and care . It has been found that fathers are firmer in their expectations for gender conformity than are mothers , and their expectations are stronger for sons than they are for daughters ( Kimmel 2000 ) . This is true in many types of activities , including preference of toys , play styles , discipline , chores , and personal achievements . As a result , boys tend to be particularly attuned to their father ’ s disapproval when engaging in an activity that might be considered feminine , like dancing or singing ( Coltraine and Adams 2008 ) . It should be noted that parental socialization and normative expectations vary along lines of social class , race , and ethnicity .

Further , in social as well as academic situations , teachers have traditionally positioned boys and girls oppositionally — reinforcing a sense of competition rather than collaboration ( Thorne 1993 ) . Boys are also permitted a greater degree of freedom regarding rule-breaking or minor acts of deviance , whereas girls are expected to follow rules carefully and to adopt an obedient posture ( Ready 2001 ) .

Most notably , when the Daughters of the American Revolution ( DAR ) refused to permit internationally renowned Black opera contralto Marian Anderson to sing in Constitution Hall , Eleanor resigned her membership in the DAR and arranged for Anderson to sing at a public concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial , followed by her appearance at a state dinner at the White House in honor of the king and queen of England .

32,"While many were pleased with the president ’ s bold plans , there were numerous critics of the New Deal , discussed in the following section . The New Deal was far from perfect , but Roosevelt ’ s quickly implemented policies reversed the economy ’ s long slide . It put new capital into ailing banks . It rescued homeowners and farmers from foreclosure and helped people keep their homes . It offered some direct relief to the unemployed poor . It gave new incentives to farmers and industry alike , and put people back to work in an effort to both create jobs and boost consumer spending . The total number of working Americans rose from twenty-four to twenty-seven million between 1933 and 1935 , in contrast to the seven-million-worker decline during the Hoover administration . Perhaps most importantly , the First New Deal changed the pervasive pessimism that had held the country in its grip since the end of 1929 . For the first time in years , people had hope .",0.8559084534645081,0.0

32,"While Roosevelt hoped the AAA would help farms and farmers , he also sought aid for the beleaguered manufacturing sector . The Emergency Railroad Transportation Act created a national railroad office to encourage cooperation among different railroad companies , hoping to shore up an industry essential to the stability of the manufacturing sector , but one that had been devastated by mismanagement . More importantly , the NIRA suspended antitrust laws and allowed businesses and industries to work together in order to establish codes of fair competition , including issues of price setting and minimum wages . New Deal officials believed that allowing these collaborations would help industries stabilize prices and production levels in the face of competitive overproduction and declining profits ; however , at the same time , many felt it important to protect workers from potentially unfair agreements .",0.9011890888214111,1.0
32,"When Roosevelt took office , he faced one of the worst moments in the country ’ s banking history . States were in disarray . New York and Illinois had ordered the closure of their banks in the hopes of avoiding further “ bank runs , ” which occurred when hundreds ( if not thousands ) of individuals ran to their banks to withdraw all of their savings . In all , over five thousand banks had been shuttered . Within forty-eight hours of his inauguration , Roosevelt proclaimed an official bank holiday and called Congress into a special session to address the crisis . The resulting Emergency Banking Act of 1933 was signed into law on March 9 , 1933 , a scant eight hours after Congress first saw it . The law officially took the country off the gold standard , a restrictive practice that , although conservative and traditionally viewed as safe , severely limited the circulation of paper money . Those who held gold were told to sell it to the U . S . Treasury for a discounted rate of a little over twenty dollars per ounce . Furthermore , dollar bills were no longer redeemable in gold . The law also gave the comptroller of currency the power to reorganize all national banks faced with insolvency , a level of federal oversight seldom seen prior to the Great Depression . Between March 11 and March 14 , auditors from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , the Treasury Department , and other federal agencies swept through the country , examining each bank . By March 15 , 70 percent of the banks were declared solvent and allowed to reopen .",0.9224061965942383,0.0

32,"Unlike Hoover , who professed an ideology of “ American individualism , ” an adherence that rendered him largely incapable of widespread action , Roosevelt remained pragmatic and open-minded to possible solutions . To assist in formulating a variety of relief and recovery programs , Roosevelt turned to a group of men who had previously orchestrated his election campaign and victory . Collectively known as the “ Brains Trust ” ( a phrase coined by a New York Times reporter to describe the multiple “ brains ” on Roosevelt ’ s advisory team ) , the group most notably included Rexford Tugwell , Raymond Moley , and Adolph Berle . Moley , credited with bringing the group into existence , was a government professor who advocated for a new national tax policy to help the nation recover from its economic woes . Tugwell , who eventually focused his energy on the country ’ s agricultural problems , saw an increased role for the federal government in setting wages and prices across the economy . Berle was a mediating influence , who often advised against a centrally controlled economy , but did see the role that the federal government could play in mediating the stark cycles of prosperity and depression that , if left unchecked , could result in the very situation in which the country presently found itself . Together , these men , along with others , advised Roosevelt through the earliest days of the New Deal and helped to craft significant legislative programs for congressional review and approval .",0.9782392978668213,0.0
32,"To the benefit of industrial workers , Roosevelt signed into law the Wagner Act , also known as the National Labor Relations Act . The protections previously afforded to workers under the NIRA were inadvertently lost when the Supreme Court struck down the original law due to larger regulatory concerns , leaving workers vulnerable . Roosevelt sought to salvage this important piece of labor legislation , doing so with the Wagner Act . The act created the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) to once again protect American workers ’ right to unionize and bargain collectively , as well as to provide a federal vehicle for labor grievances to be heard . Although roundly criticized by the Republican Party and factory owners , the Wagner Act withstood several challenges and eventually received constitutional sanction by the U . S . Supreme Court in 1937 . The law received the strong support of John L . Lewis and the Congress of Industrial Organizations who had long sought government protection of industrial unionism , from the time they split from the American Federation of Labor in 1935 over disputes on whether to organize workers along craft or industrial lines . Following passage of the law , Lewis began a widespread publicity campaign urging industrial workers to join “ the president ’ s union . ” The relationship was mutually beneficial to Roosevelt , who subsequently received the endorsement of Lewis ’ s United Mine Workers union in the 1936 presidential election , along with a sizeable $ 500,000 campaign contribution . The Wagner Act permanently established government-secured workers ’ rights and protections from their employers , and it marked the beginning of labor ’ s political support for the Democratic Party .",1.0051417350769043,0.0
32,"This was a bold attempt to help farmers address the systemic problems of overproduction and lower commodity prices . Despite previous efforts to regulate farming through subsidies , never before had the federal government intervened on this scale ; the notion of paying farmers not to produce crops was unheard of . One significant problem , however , was that , in some cases , there was already an excess of crops , in particular , cotton and hogs , which clogged the marketplace . A bumper crop in 1933 , combined with the slow implementation of the AAA , led the government to order the plowing under of ten million acres of cotton , and the butchering of six million baby pigs and 200,000 sows . Although it worked to some degree — the price of cotton increased from six to twelve cents per pound — this move was deeply problematic . Critics saw it as the ultimate example of corrupt capitalism : a government destroying food , while its citizens were starving , in order to drive up prices .",0.8334823846817017,0.0

32,"The legacy of the New Deal is in part seen in the vast increase in national power : The federal government accepted responsibility for the nation ’ s economic stability and prosperity . In retrospect , the majority of historians and economists judge it to have been a tremendous success . The New Deal not only established minimum standards for wages , working conditions , and overall welfare , it also allowed millions of Americans to hold onto their homes , farms , and savings . It laid the groundwork for an agenda of expanded federal government influence over the economy that continued through President Harry Truman ’ s “ Fair Deal ” in the 1950s and President Lyndon Johnson ’ s call for a “ Great Society ” in the 1960s . The New Deal state that embraced its responsibility for the citizens ’ welfare and proved willing to use its power and resources to spread the nation ’ s prosperity lasted well into the 1980s , and many of its tenets persist today . Many would also agree that the postwar economic stability of the 1950s found its roots in the stabilizing influences introduced by social security , the job stability that union contracts provided , and federal housing mortgage programs introduced in the New Deal .

He carried all but six states while winning over 57 percent of the popular vote . Whether they voted due to animosity towards Hoover for his relative inactivity , or out of hope for what Roosevelt would accomplish , the American public committed themselves to a new vision . Historians identify this election as the beginning of a new Democratic coalition , bringing together African Americans , other ethnic minorities , and organized labor as a voting bloc upon whom the party would rely for many of its electoral victories over the next fifty years . Unlike some European nations where similar challenges caused democratic constitutions to crumble and give way to radical ideologies and authoritarian governments , the Roosevelt administration changed the nation ’ s economic fortunes with reforms , preserved the constitution , and expanded rather than limited the reach of democratic principles into the market economy .

Under this plan , Long recommended the liquidation of all large personal fortunes in order to fund direct payments to less fortunate Americans . He foresaw giving $ 5,000 to every family , $ 2,500 to every worker , as well as a series of elderly pensions and education funds . Despite his questionable math , which numerous economists quickly pointed out rendered his program unworkable , by 1935 , Long had a significant following of over four million people .

Likewise , as with several other New Deal programs , women did not directly benefit from these employment opportunities , as they were explicitly excluded for the benefit of men who most Americans still considered the family ’ s primary breadwinner . However , with the arrival of electricity came new industrial ventures , including several textile mills up and down the valley , several of which offered employment to women . Throughout his presidency , Roosevelt frequently pointed to the TVA as one of the glowing accomplishments of the New Deal and its ability to bring together the machinery of the federal government along with private interests to revitalize a regional economy .

32,"Roosevelt was not as successful in addressing the nation ’ s growing deficit . When he entered the presidency in 1933 , Roosevelt did so with traditionally held fiscal beliefs , including the importance of a balanced budget in order to maintain public confidence in federal government operations . However , the severe economic conditions of the depression quickly convinced the president of the importance of government spending to create jobs and relief for the American people . As he commented to a crowd in Pittsburgh in 1936 , “ To balance our budget in 1933 or 1934 or 1935 would have been a crime against the American people . To do so . . . we should have had to set our face against human suffering with callous indifference . When Americans suffered , we refused to pass by on the other side . Humanity came first . ” However , after his successful re-election , Roosevelt anticipated that the economy would recover enough by late 1936 that he could curtail spending by 1937 . This reduction in spending , he hoped , would curb the deficit . As the early months of 1937 unfolded , Roosevelt ’ s hopes seemed supported by the most recent economic snapshot of the country . Production , wages , and profits had all returned to pre - 1929 levels , while unemployment was at its lowest rate in the decade , down from 25 percent to 14 percent . But no sooner did Roosevelt cut spending when a recession hit . Two million Americans were newly out of work as unemployment quickly rose by 5 percent and industrial production declined by a third . Breadlines began to build again , while banks prepared to close . Historians continue to debate the causes of this recession within a depression . Some believe the fear of increased taxes forced factory owners to curtail planned expansion ; others blame the Federal Reserve for tightening the nation ’ s money supply . Roosevelt , however , blamed the downturn on his decision to significantly curtail federal government spending in job relief programs such as the WPA . Several of his closest advisors , including Harry Hopkins , Henry Wallace , and others , urged him to adopt the new economic theory espoused by British economic John Maynard Keynes , who argued that deficit spending was necessary in advanced capitalist economies in order to maintain employment and stimulate consumer spending . Convinced of the necessity of such an approach , Roosevelt asked Congress in the spring of 1938 for additional emergency relief spending . Congress immediately authorized $ 33 billion for PWA and WPA work projects .

At its peak , there were some four million Americans repairing bridges , building roads and airports , and undertaking other public projects . Another work program was the Civilian Conservation Corps Relief Act ( CCC ) . The CCC provided government jobs for young men aged fourteen to twenty-four who came from relief families . They would earn thirty dollars per month planting trees , fighting forest fires , and refurbishing historic sites and parks , building an infrastructure that families would continue to enjoy for generations to come .

32,"On the issue of race relations themselves , Roosevelt has a mixed legacy . Within his White House , Roosevelt had a number of African American appointees , although most were in minor positions . Unofficially , Roosevelt relied upon advice from the Federal Council on Negro Affairs , also known as his “ Black Cabinet . ” This group included a young Harvard economist , Dr . Robert Weaver , who subsequently became the nation ’ s first Black cabinet secretary in 1966 , as President Lyndon Johnson ’ s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more Black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country . One key figure in the NYA was Mary McLeod Bethune ( Figure 26.13 ) , a prominent African American educator tapped by Roosevelt to act as the director of the NYA ’ s Division of Negro Affairs . Bethune had been a spokesperson and an educator for years ; with this role , she became one of the president ’ s foremost African American advisors . During his presidency , Roosevelt became the first to appoint a Black federal judge , as well as the first commander-in-chief to promote an African American to brigadier general . Most notably , he became the first president to publicly speak against lynching as a “ vile form of collective murder . ”",0.7580949068069458,1.0
32,"On March 12 , the day before the banks were set to reopen , Roosevelt held his first “ fireside chat ” ( Figure 26.5 ) . In this initial radio address to the American people , he explained what the bank examiners had been doing over the previous week . He assured people that any bank open the next day had the federal government ’ s stamp of approval . The combination of his reassuring manner and the promise that the government was addressing the problems worked wonders in changing the popular mindset . Just as the culture of panic had contributed to the country ’ s downward spiral after the crash , so did this confidence-inducing move help to build it back up . Consumer confidence returned , and within weeks , close to $ 1 billion in cash and gold had been brought out from under mattresses and hidden bookshelves , and re-deposited in the nation ’ s banks . The immediate crisis had been quelled , and the public was ready to believe in their new president .",0.024347376078367233,0.0

32,"Much like a surgeon assessing the condition of an emergency room patient , Roosevelt began his administration with a broad , if not specific , strategy in mind : a combination of relief and recovery programs designed to first save the patient ( in this case , the American people ) , and then to find a long-term cure ( reform through federal regulation of the economy ) . What later became known as the “ First New Deal ” ushered in a wave of legislative activity seldom before seen in the history of the country . By the close of 1933 , in an effort to stem the crisis , Congress had passed over fifteen significant pieces of legislation — many of the circulated bills allegedly still wet with ink from the printing presses as members voted upon them . Most bills could be grouped around issues of relief , recovery , and reform . At the outset of the First New Deal , specific goals included 1 ) bank reform ; 2 ) job creation ; 3 ) economic regulation ; and 4 ) regional planning .",0.974151074886322,0.0

Townsend of California was one who felt that Roosevelt had failed to adequately address the country ’ s tremendous problems . Townsend , who was a retired dentist , proposed an expansive pension plan for the elderly . The Townsend Plan , as it was known , gained a great deal of popularity : It recommended paying every citizen over sixty who retired from work the sum of $ 200 per month , provided they spend it in thirty days . Another figure who gained national attention was Father Charles Coughlin . He was a “ radio priest ” from Michigan who , although he initially supported the New Deal , subsequently argued that Roosevelt stopped far too short in his defense of labor , monetary reform , and the nationalization of key industries . The president ’ s plan , he proclaimed , was inadequate . He created the National Union for Social Justice and used his weekly radio show to gain followers .",0.9385989904403687,0.0
32,"March 4 , 1933 , dawned gray and rainy . Roosevelt rode in an open car along with outgoing president Hoover , facing the public , as he made his way to the U . S . Capitol . Hoover ’ s mood was somber , still personally angry over his defeat in the general election the previous November ; he refused to crack a smile at all during the ride among the crowd , despite Roosevelt ’ s urging to the contrary . At the ceremony , Roosevelt rose with the aid of leg braces equipped under his specially tailored trousers and placed his hand on a Dutch family Bible as he took his solemn oath . At that very moment , the rain stopped and the sun began to shine directly on the platform , and those present would later claim that it was as though God himself was shining down on Roosevelt and the American people in that moment ( Figure 26.4 ) .",0.014596538618206978,0.0

32,"It was the hard work of Roosevelt ’ s advisors — the “ Brains Trust ” of scholars and thinkers from leading universities — as well as Congress and the American public who helped the New Deal succeed as well as it did . Ironically , it was the American people ’ s volunteer spirit , so extolled by Hoover , that Roosevelt was able to harness . The first hundred days of his administration was not a master plan that Roosevelt dreamed up and executed on his own . In fact , it was not a master plan at all , but rather a series of , at times , disjointed efforts made from different assumptions . But after taking office and analyzing the crisis , Roosevelt and his advisors did feel that they had a larger sense of what had caused the Great Depression and thus attempted a variety of solutions to fix it . They believed that it was caused by abuses on the part of a small group of bankers and businessmen , aided by Republican policies that built wealth for a few at the expense of many . The answer , they felt , was to root out these abuses through banking reform , as well as adjust production and consumption of both farm and industrial goods . This adjustment would come about by increasing the purchasing power of everyday people , as well as through regulatory policies like the NRA and AAA . While it may seem counterintuitive to raise crop prices and set prices on industrial goods , Roosevelt ’ s advisors sought to halt the deflationary spiral and economic uncertainty that had prevented businesses from committing to investments and consumers from parting with their money . 26.3 The Second New Deal Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you should be able to :",0.8932675719261169,0.0

Whether attacking his character or simply stating that he was moving away from American values toward fascism and socialism , they sought to undermine his power and popularity . Most notably , the American Liberty League — comprised largely of conservative Democrats who lamented the excesses of several of Roosevelt ’ s New Deal programs — labeled the AAA as fascist and proclaimed later New Deal programs to be key threats to the very nature of democracy . Additional criticism came from the National Association of Manufacturers , which urged businessmen to outright ignore portions of the NRA that promoted collective bargaining , as well as subsequent labor protection legislation . In 1935 , the U . S . Supreme Court dealt the most crushing blow to Roosevelt ’ s vision , striking down several key pieces of the New Deal as unconstitutional . They found that both the AAA and the NIRA overreached federal authority .

This law also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , or FDIC , which insured personal bank deposits up to $ 2,500 . Other measures designed to boost confidence in the overall economy beyond the banking system included passage of the Economy Act , which fulfilled Roosevelt ’ s campaign pledge to reduce government spending by reducing salaries , including his own and those of the Congress . He also signed into law the Securities Act , which required full disclosure to the federal government from all corporations and investment banks that wanted to market stocks and bonds . Roosevelt also sought new revenue through the Beer Tax .

In that time , the program provided employment relief to over eight million Americans , or approximately 20 percent of the country ’ s workforce . The WPA funded the construction of more than 2,500 hospitals , 5,900 schools , 570,000 miles of road , and more . The WPA also created Federal Project Number One , which employed approximately forty thousand artists in theater , art , music , and writing . They produced state murals , guidebooks , concerts , and drama performances all around the country ( Figure 26.12 ) . Additionally , the project funded the collection of oral histories , including those of formerly enslaved people , which provided a valuable addition to the nation ’ s understanding of slave life .

32,"However , despite these efforts , Roosevelt also understood the precariousness of his political position . In order to maintain a coalition of Democrats to support his larger relief and recovery efforts , Roosevelt could not afford to alienate Southern Democrats who might easily bolt should he openly advocate for civil rights . While he spoke about the importance of anti-lynching legislation , he never formally pushed Congress to propose such a law . He did publicly support the abolition of the poll tax , which Congress eventually accomplished in 1941 . Likewise , although agency directors adopted changes to ensure job opportunities for African Americans at the federal level , at the local level , few advancements were made , and African Americans remained at the back of the employment lines . Despite such failures , however , Roosevelt deserves credit for acknowledging the importance of race relations and civil rights . At the federal level , more than any of his predecessors since the Civil War , Roosevelt remained aware of the role that the federal government can play in initiating important discussions about civil rights , as well as encouraging the development of a new cadre of civil rights leaders .",0.018552081659436226,0.0

Among her first substantial projects was the creation of Arthurdale — a resettlement community for displaced coal miners in West Virginia .

Roosevelt felt that the country needed sweeping change , and he ran a campaign intended to convince the American people that he could deliver that change . It was not the specifics of his campaign promises that were different ; in fact , he gave very few details and likely did not yet have a clear idea of how he would raise the country out of the Great Depression . But he campaigned tirelessly , talking to thousands of people , appearing at his party ’ s national convention , and striving to show the public that he was a different breed of politician .

32,"For women , Roosevelt ’ s policies and practices had a similarly mixed effect . Wage discrimination in federal jobs programs was rampant , and relief policies encouraged women to remain home and leave jobs open for men . This belief was well in line with the gender norms of the day . Several federal relief programs specifically forbade husbands and wives ’ both drawing jobs or relief from the same agency . The WPA became the first specific New Deal agency to openly hire women — specifically widows , single women , and the wives of disabled husbands . While they did not take part in construction projects , these women did undertake sewing projects to provide blankets and clothing to hospitals and relief agencies . Likewise , several women took part in the various Federal One art projects . Despite the obvious gender limitations , many women strongly supported Roosevelt ’ s New Deal , as much for its direct relief handouts for women as for its employment opportunities for men . One such woman was Mary ( Molly ) Dewson . A longtime activist in the women ’ s suffrage movement , Dewson worked for women ’ s rights and ultimately rose to be the Director of the Women ’ s Division of the Democratic Party . Dewson and Mary McLeod Bethune , the national champion of African American education and literacy who rose to the level of Director of the Division of Negro Affairs for the NYA , understood the limitations of the New Deal , but also the opportunities for advancement it presented during very trying times . Rather than lamenting what Roosevelt could not or would not do , they felt , and perhaps rightly so , that Roosevelt would do more than most to help women and African Americans achieve a piece of the new America he was building .",0.7026069164276123,1.0

He famously stated , “ The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . ” Upon hearing his inaugural address , one observer in the crowd later commented , “ Any man who can talk like that in times like these is worth every ounce of support a true American has . ” To borrow the popular song title of the day , “ happy days were here again . ” Foregoing the traditional inaugural parties , the new president immediately returned to the White House to begin his work to save the nation . 26.2 The First New Deal Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you should be able to :",0.030103912577033043,0.0

32,"Any ideas that Roosevelt held almost did not come to fruition , thanks to a would-be assassin ’ s bullet . On February 15 , 1933 , after delivering a speech from his open car in Miami ’ s Bayfront Park , local Italian bricklayer Giuseppe Zangara emerged from a crowd of well-wishers to fire six shots from his revolver . Although Roosevelt emerged from the assassination attempt unscathed , Zangara wounded five individuals that day , including Chicago Mayor Tony Cermak , who attended the speech in the hopes of resolving any long-standing differences with the president-elect . Roosevelt and his driver immediately rushed Cermak to the hospital where he died 19 days later . Roosevelt ’ s calm and collected response to the event reassured many Americans of his ability to lead the nation through the challenges they faced . All that awaited was Roosevelt ’ s inauguration before his ideas would unfold to the expectant public . So what was Roosevelt ’ s plan ? Before he took office , it seems likely that he was not entirely sure .

32,"Another problem plaguing this relief effort was the disparity between large commercial farms , which received the largest payments and set the quotas , and the small family farms that felt no relief . Large farms often cut production by laying off sharecroppers or evicting tenant farmers , making the program even worse for them than for small farm owners . Their frustration led to the creation of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union ( STFU ) , an interracial organization that sought to gain government relief for these most disenfranchised of farmers . The STFU organized , protested , and won its members some wage increases through the mid - 1930s , but the overall plight of these workers remained dismal . As a result , many of them followed the thousands of Dust Bowl refugees to California ( Figure 26.7 ) .",0.2057654857635498,0.0
32,"Another challenge faced by the NRA was that the provision granting workers the right to organize appeared to others as a mandate to do so . In previously unorganized industries , such as oil and gas , rubber , and service occupations , workers now sought groups that would assist in their organization , bolstered by the encouragement they now felt from the government . The Communist Party took advantage of the opportunity to assist in the hope of creating widespread protests against the American industrial structure . The number of strikes nationwide doubled between 1932 and 1934 , with over 1.5 million workers going on strike in 1934 alone , often in protests that culminated in bloodshed . A strike at the Auto-Lite plant in Toledo , Ohio , that summer resulted in ten thousand workers from other factories joining in sympathy with their fellow workers to attack potential strike-breakers with stones and bricks . Simultaneously in Minneapolis , a teamsters strike resulted in frequent , bloody confrontations between workers and police , leading the governor to contemplate declaring martial law before the companies agreed to negotiate better wages and conditions for the workers . Finally , a San Francisco strike among 14,000 longshoremen closed the city ’ s waterfront and eventually led to a city-wide general strike of over 130,000 workers , essentially paralyzing the city . Clashes between workers , and police and National Guardsmen left many strikers bloodied , and at least two dead .",0.25303545594215393,0.0

In 1934 , he signed into law the Indian Reorganization Act ( sometimes referred to as the “ Indian New Deal ” ) . This law formally abandoned the assimilationist policies set forth in the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 . Rather than forcing Native Americans to adapt to American culture , the new program encouraged them to develop forms of local self-government , as well as to preserve their artifacts and heritage . John Collier , the Commissioner on Indian Bureau Affairs from 1933 to 1945 , championed this legislation and saw it as an opportunity to correct past injustices that land allotment and assimilation had wrought upon Native peoples . Although the re-establishment of communal tribal lands would prove to be difficult , Collier used this law to convince federal officials to return nearly two million acres of government-held land to various tribes in order to move the process along . Although subsequent legislation later circumscribed the degree to which tribes were allowed to self-govern on reservations , Collier ’ s work is still viewed as a significant step in improving race relations with Native Americans and preserving their heritage .",1.0008107423782349,0.0

Congress did not pass a single significant piece of legislation during this period , although Hoover spent much of the time trying to get Roosevelt to commit publicly to a legislative agenda of Hoover ’ s choosing . Roosevelt remained gracious but refused to begin his administration as the incumbent ’ s advisor without any legal authority necessary to change policy . Unwilling to tie himself to Hoover ’ s legacy of failed policies , Roosevelt kept quiet when Hoover supported the passage of a national sales tax . Meanwhile , the country suffered from Hoover ’ s inability to further drive a legislative agenda through Congress . It was the worst winter since the beginning of the Great Depression , and the banking sector once again suffered another round of panics . While Roosevelt kept his distance from the final tremors of the Hoover administration , the country continued to suffer in wait . In part as a response to the challenges of this time , the U . S .

It is thought that modern humans arose in Africa from H . erectus and migrated out of Africa about 100,000 years ago in a second major migration wave . Then , modern humans replaced H . erectus species that had migrated into Asia and Europe in the first wave . This evolutionary timeline is supported by molecular evidence . One approach to studying the origins of modern humans is to examine mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) from populations around the world . Because a fetus develops from an egg containing its mother ’ s mitochondria ( which have their own , non-nuclear DNA ) , mtDNA is passed entirely through the maternal line . Mutations in mtDNA can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence . The resulting evidence suggests that all modern humans have mtDNA inherited from a common ancestor that lived in Africa about 160,000 years ago . Another approach to the molecular understanding of human evolution is to examine the Y chromosome , which is passed from father to son .

33,"The fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods : now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago . Evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water , to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land ; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period . One of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus Acanthostega . Acanthostega was aquatic ; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes . However , it also had four limbs , with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods , including amphibians . Therefore , it is thought that Acanthostega lived in shallow waters and was an intermediate form between lobe-finned fishes and early , fully terrestrial tetrapods . What preceded Acanthostega ? In 2006 , researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a “ tetrapod-like fish , ” Tiktaalik roseae , which seems to be an intermediate form between fishes having fins and tetrapods having limbs ( Figure 29.15 ) .

Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans , although our species is the only surviving member . The term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line , thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees . Hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species — including Australopithecus , Homo habilis , and Homo erectus — and those non-ancestral groups that can be considered “ cousins ” of modern humans , such as Neanderthals . Determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult . In years past , when relatively few hominin fossils had been recovered , some scientists believed that considering them in order , from oldest to youngest , would demonstrate the course of evolution from early hominins to modern humans . In the past several years , however , many new fossils have been found , and it is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found ( and species named ) represent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans .",0.9155423045158386,0.0

In amniotes that lay eggs , the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen .

The Permian period also saw a second major divergence of diapsid reptiles into archosaurs ( predecessors of crocodilians and dinosaurs ) and lepidosaurs ( predecessors of snakes and lizards ) . These groups remained inconspicuous until the Triassic period , when the archosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during the Permian-Triassic extinction . About 250 million years ago , archosaurs radiated into the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs . Although they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs , the pterosaurs were distinct from true dinosaurs ( Figure 29.23 ) .

Reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help regulate body temperature , such as basking in sunny places to warm up and finding shady spots or going underground to cool down . The advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body ; therefore , reptiles can survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm . In cold weather , some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate . Brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating , but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves .

33,"Frog eggs are fertilized externally , and like other amphibians , frogs generally lay their eggs in moist environments . A moist environment is required as eggs lack a shell and thus dehydrate quickly in dry environments . Frogs demonstrate a great diversity of parental behaviors , with some species laying many eggs and exhibiting little parental care , to species that carry eggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or backs . The life cycle of frogs , as other amphibians , consists of two distinct stages : the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to an adult stage . The larval stage of a frog , the tadpole , is often a filter-feeding herbivore . Tadpoles usually have gills , a lateral line system , long-finned tails , and lack limbs . At the end of the tadpole stage , frogs undergo metamorphosis into the adult form ( Figure 29.18 ) . During this stage , the gills , tail , and lateral line system disappear , and four limbs develop . The jaws become larger and are suited for carnivorous feeding , and the digestive system transforms into the typical short gut of a predator . An eardrum and air-breathing lungs also develop . These changes during metamorphosis allow the larvae to move onto land in the adult stage .",0.520192563533783,0.0
33,"Flapping of the entire wing occurs primarily through the actions of the chest muscles , the pectoralis and the supracoracoideus . These muscles are highly developed in birds and account for a higher percentage of body mass than in most mammals . These attach to a blade-shaped keel , like that of a boat , located on the sternum . The sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates , which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings . Another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles ( collarbones ) , forming the furcula or wishbone . The furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping .",0.9798715114593506,0.0

Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers . Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust . Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift . Contour feathers are the feathers found on the body , and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight .

The ability of gnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources likely is one reason that they replaced most jawless fishes during the Devonian period . Two early groups of gnathostomes were the acanthodians and placoderms ( Figure 29.10 ) , which arose in the late Silurian period and are now extinct .

33,"Dinosaurs ( including birds ) are further subdivided into two groups , the Saurischia ( “ lizard like ” ) and the Ornithischia ( “ bird like ” ) . Despite the names of these groups , it was not the bird-like dinosaurs that gave rise to modern birds . Rather , Saurischia diverged into two groups : One included the long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs , such as Apatosaurus . The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds . This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( Figure 29.33 ) . Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs , because it is an intermediate fossil , meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds . Some scientists propose classifying it as a bird , but others prefer to classify it as a dinosaur . The fossilized skeleton of Archaeopteryx looks like that of a dinosaur , and it had teeth whereas birds do not , but it also had feathers modified for flight , a trait associated only with birds among modern animals . Fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist , but the feathers do not have the characteristics of flight feathers . It is still unclear exactly how flight evolved in birds . Two main theories exist , the arboreal ( “ tree ” ) hypothesis and the terrestrial ( “ land ” ) hypothesis . The arboreal hypothesis posits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from branch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight . In contrast to this , the terrestrial hypothesis holds that running was the stimulus for flight , as wings could be used to improve running and then became used for flapping flight . Like the question of how flight evolved , the question of how endothermy evolved in birds still is unanswered . Feathers provide insulation , but this is only beneficial if body heat is being produced internally . Similarly , internal heat production is only viable if insulation is present to retain that heat . It has been suggested that one or the other — feathers or endothermy — evolved in response to some other selective pressure .",1.0064951181411743,1.0

33,"Based on molecular analysis , vertebrates appear to be more closely related to lancelets ( cephalochordates ) than to tunicates ( urochordates ) among the invertebrate chordates . This evidence suggests that the cephalochordates diverged from Urochordata and the vertebrates subsequently diverged from the cephalochordates . This hypothesis is further supported by the discovery of a fossil in China from the genus Haikouella . This organism seems to be an intermediate form between cephalochordates and vertebrates . The Haikouella fossils are about 530 million years old and appear similar to modern lancelets . These organisms had a brain and eyes , as do vertebrates , but lack the skull found in craniates . 1 This evidence suggests that vertebrates arose during the Cambrian explosion . Recall that the “ Cambrian explosion ” is the name given to a relatively brief span of time during the Cambrian period during which many animal groups appeared and rapidly diversified . Most modern animal phyla originated during the Cambrian explosion . 1 Chen , J . Y . , Huang , D . Y . , and Li , C . W . , “ An early Cambrian craniate-like chordate , ” Nature 402 ( 1999 ): 518 – 522 , doi : 10.1038 / 990080 . Vertebrates are the largest group of chordates , with more than 62,000 living species . Vertebrates are grouped based on anatomical and physiological traits . More than one classification and naming scheme is used for these animals . Here we will consider the traditional groups Agnatha , Chondrichthyes , Osteichthyes , Amphibia , Reptilia , Aves , and Mammalia , which constitute classes in the subphylum Vertebrata . Many modern authors classify birds within Reptilia , which correctly reflects their evolutionary heritage . We consider them separately only for convenience . Further , we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes , the agnathans , although emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes ( the hagfishes ) and vertebrate jawless fishes ( the lampreys ) .",1.0003564357757568,1.0
33,"Australopithecus ( “ southern ape ” ) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern Africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago . This genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus , genus Homo , evolved from a common ancestor shared with Australopithecus about 2 million years ago ( after likely passing through some transitional states ) . Australopithecus had a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern humans . For example , sexual dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans . Males were up to 50 percent larger than females , a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans . In contrast , modern human males are approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females . The brain size of Australopithecus relative to its body mass was also smaller than modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes . A key feature that Australopithecus had in common with modern humans was bipedalism , although it is likely that Australopithecus also spent time in trees . Hominin footprints , similar to those of modern humans , were found in Laetoli , Tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago . They showed that hominins at the time of Australopithecus were walking upright . There were a number of Australopithecus species , which are often referred to as australopiths . Australopithecus anamensis lived about 4.2 million years ago . More is known about another early species , Australopithecus afarensis , which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago . This species demonstrates a trend in human evolution : the reduction of the dentition and jaw in size . A . afarensis ( Figure 29.42 ) had smaller canines and molars compared to apes , but these were larger than those of modern humans . Its brain size was 380 – 450 cubic centimeters , approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain . It also had prognathic jaws , which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans . In the mid - 1970s , the fossil of an adult female A . afarensis was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago ( Figure 29.43 ) . The fossil , which is informally called “ Lucy , ” is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found , with 40 percent of the skeleton recovered . Australopithecus africanus lived between 2 and 3 million years ago . It had a slender build and was bipedal , but had robust arm bones and , like other early hominids , may have spent significant time in trees . Its brain was larger than that of A . afarensis at 500 cubic centimeters , which is slightly less than one-third the size of modern human brains . Two other species , Australopithecus bahrelghazali and Australopithecus garhi , have been added to the roster of australopiths in recent years .",1.004193663597107,0.0

As plants and ecosystems continued to grow and become more complex , vertebrates moved from the water to land . The presence of shoreline vegetation may have contributed to the movement of vertebrates onto land . One hypothesis suggests that the fins of aquatic vertebrates were used to maneuver through this vegetation , providing a precursor to the movement of fins on land and the development of limbs . The late Paleozoic was a time of diversification of vertebrates , as amniotes emerged and became two different lines that gave rise , on one hand , to mammals , and , on the other hand , to reptiles and birds . Many marine vertebrates became extinct near the end of the Devonian period , which ended about 360 million years ago , and both marine and terrestrial vertebrates were decimated by a mass extinction in the early Permian period about 250 million years ago .",0.3703615069389343,0.0

The increased metabolic rate required to internally modify body temperature went hand in hand with changes to certain skeletal structures . The later synapsids , which had more evolved characteristics unique to mammals , possess cheeks for holding food and heterodont teeth , which are specialized for chewing , mechanically breaking down food to speed digestion and releasing the energy needed to produce heat . Chewing also requires the ability to chew and breathe at the same time , which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate . A secondary palate separates the area of the mouth where chewing occurs from the area above where respiration occurs , allowing breathing to proceed uninterrupted during chewing . A secondary palate is not found in pelycosaurs but is present in cynodonts and mammals . The jawbone also shows changes from early synapsids to later ones .

These offerings provided an immediate escape from the squalor and difficulties of everyday life . As improved means of internal transportation developed , working-class residents could escape the city and experience one of the popular new forms of entertainment — the amusement park . For example , Coney Island on the Brooklyn shoreline consisted of several different amusement parks , the first of which opened in 1895 ( Figure 19.11 ) . At these parks , New Yorkers enjoyed wild rides , animal attractions , and large stage productions designed to help them forget the struggles of their working-day lives .

For a mere ten cents , spectators could watch a high-diving horse , take a ride to the moon to watch moon maidens eat green cheese , or witness the electrocution of an elephant , a spectacle that fascinated the public both with technological marvels and exotic wildlife . The treatment of animals in many acts at Coney Island and other public amusement parks drew the attention of middle-class reformers such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .

Eastern cities , unlike their midwestern counterparts , could not continue to grow outward , as the land surrounding them was already settled . Geographic limitations such as rivers or the coast also hampered sprawl . And in all cities , citizens needed to be close enough to urban centers to conveniently access work , shops , and other core institutions of urban life . The increasing cost of real estate made upward growth attractive , and so did the prestige that towering buildings carried for the businesses that occupied them . Workers completed the first skyscraper in Chicago , the ten-story Home Insurance Building , in 1885 ( Figure 19.5 ) . Although engineers had the capability to go higher , thanks to new steel construction techniques , they required another vital invention in order to make taller buildings viable : the elevator .

Greater educational opportunities and more expansive personal freedoms mattered greatly to the African Americans who made the trek northward during the Great Migration . State legislatures and local school districts allocated more funds for the education of both Blacks and Whites in the North , and also enforced compulsory school attendance laws more rigorously . Similarly , unlike the South where a simple gesture ( or lack of a deferential one ) could result in physical harm to the African American who committed it , life in larger , crowded northern urban centers permitted a degree of anonymity — and with it , personal freedom — that enabled African Americans to move , work , and speak without deferring to every White person with whom they crossed paths .

34,"Political philosopher Herbert Spencer took Darwin ’ s theory of evolution further , coining the actual phrase “ survival of the fittest , ” and later helping to popularize the phrase social Darwinism to posit that society evolved much like a natural organism , wherein some individuals will succeed due to racially and ethnically inherent traits , and their ability to adapt . This model allowed that a collection of traits and skills , which could include intelligence , inherited wealth , and so on , mixed with the ability to adapt , would let all Americans rise or fall of their own accord , so long as the road to success was accessible to all . William Graham Sumner , a sociologist at Yale , became the most vocal proponent of social Darwinism . Not surprisingly , this ideology , which Darwin himself would have rejected as a gross misreading of his scientific discoveries , drew great praise from those who made their wealth at this time . They saw their success as proof of biological fitness , although critics of this theory were quick to point out that those who did not succeed often did not have the same opportunities or equal playing field that the ideology of social Darwinism purported . Eventually , the concept fell into disrepute in the 1930s and 1940s , as eugenicists began to utilize it in conjunction with their racial theories of genetic superiority .",0.9302846193313599,1.0

These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted . Philosopher William James was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism , which held that Americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about American society , rather than assuming that there was truth in old , previously accepted models . Only by tying ideas , thoughts , and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth , according to James . His work strongly influenced the subsequent avant-garde and modernist movements in literature and art , especially in understanding the role of the observer , artist , or writer in shaping the society they attempted to observe . John Dewey built on the idea of pragmatism to create a theory of instrumentalism , which advocated the use of education in the search for truth . Dewey believed that education , specifically observation and change through the scientific method , was the best tool by which to reform and improve American society as it continued to grow ever more complex . To that end , Dewey strongly encouraged educational reforms designed to create an informed American citizenry that could then form the basis for other , much-needed progressive reforms in society .",0.9643351435661316,1.0

The idea quickly drew fire from the Anglican Church ( although a liberal branch of Anglicans embraced the notion of natural selection being part of God ’ s plan ) and later from many others , both in England and abroad , who felt that the theory directly contradicted the role of God in the earth ’ s creation .

34,"One example of a machine political system was the Democratic political machine Tammany Hall in New York , run by machine boss William Tweed with assistance from George Washington Plunkitt ( Figure 19.10 ) . There , citizens knew their immediate problems would be addressed in return for their promise of political support in future elections . In this way , machines provided timely solutions for citizens and votes for the politicians . For example , if in Little Italy there was a desperate need for sidewalks in order to improve traffic to the stores on a particular street , the request would likely get bogged down in the bureaucratic red tape at city hall . Instead , store owners would approach the machine . A district captain would approach the “ boss ” and make him aware of the problem . The boss would contact city politicians and strongly urge them to appropriate the needed funds for the sidewalk in exchange for the promise that the boss would direct votes in their favor in the upcoming election . The boss then used the funds to pay one of his friends for the sidewalk construction , typically at an exorbitant cost , with a financial kickback to the boss , which was known as graft . The sidewalk was built more quickly than anyone hoped , in exchange for the citizens ’ promises to vote for machine-supported candidates in the next elections . Despite its corrupt nature , Tammany Hall essentially ran New York politics from the 1850s until the 1930s . Other large cities , including Boston , Philadelphia , Cleveland , St .

34,"Olmsted , one of the earliest and most influential designers of urban green space , and the original designer of Central Park in New York , worked with Burnham to introduce the idea of the City Beautiful movement at the Columbian Exposition in 1893 . There , they helped to design and construct the “ White City ” — so named for the plaster of Paris construction of several buildings that were subsequently painted a bright white — an example of landscaping and architecture that shone as an example of perfect city planning . From wide-open green spaces to brightly painted white buildings , connected with modern transportation services and appropriate sanitation , the “ White City ” set the stage for American urban city planning for the next generation , beginning in 1901 with the modernization of Washington , DC . This model encouraged city planners to consider three principal tenets : First , create larger park areas inside cities ; second , build wider boulevards to decrease traffic congestion and allow for lines of trees and other greenery between lanes ; and third , add more suburbs in order to mitigate congested living in the city itself ( Figure 19.15 ) . As each city adapted these principles in various ways , the City Beautiful movement became a cornerstone of urban development well into the twentieth century . 19.4 Change Reflected in Thought and Writing Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",1.0104130506515503,0.0
34,"Novelists and journalists also popularized realism in literary works . Authors such as Stephen Crane , who wrote stark stories about life in the slums or during the Civil War , and Rebecca Harding Davis , who in 1861 published Life in the Iron Mills , embodied this popular style . Mark Twain also sought realism in his books , whether it was the reality of the pioneer spirit , seen in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , published in 1884 , or the issue of corruption in The Gilded Age , co-authored with Charles Dudley Warner in 1873 . The narratives and visual arts of these realists could nonetheless be highly stylized , crafted , and even fabricated , since their goal was the effective portrayal of social realities they thought required reform . Some authors , such as Jack London , who wrote The Call of the Wild , embraced a school of thought called naturalism , which concluded that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only truly relevant laws governing humanity ( Figure 19.17 ) . Kate Chopin , widely regarded as the foremost woman short story writer and novelist of her day , sought to portray a realistic view of women ’ s lives in late nineteenth-century America , thus paving the way for more explicit feminist literature in generations to come . Although Chopin never described herself as a feminist per se , her reflective works on her experiences as a southern woman introduced a form of creative nonfiction that captured the struggles of women in the United States through their own individual experiences . She also was among the first authors to openly address the race issue of miscegenation . In her work Desiree ’ s Baby , Chopin specifically explores the Creole community of her native Louisiana in depths that exposed the reality of racism in a manner seldom seen in literature of the time .",0.9635553956031799,1.0

Pioneering women such as Jane Addams in Chicago and Lillian Wald in New York led this early progressive reform movement in the United States , building upon ideas originally fashioned by social reformers in England . With no particular religious bent , they worked to create settlement houses in urban centers where they could help the working class , and in particular , working-class women , find aid .

Addams opened her now-famous Hull House ( Figure 19.7 ) in Chicago in 1889 , and Wald ’ s Henry Street Settlement opened in New York six years later . The movement spread quickly to other cities , where they not only provided relief to working-class women but also offered employment opportunities for women graduating college in the growing field of social work .

In the book , Bellamy predicts the future advent of credit cards , cable entertainment , and “ super-store ” cooperatives that resemble a modern day Wal-Mart . Looking Backward proved to be a popular bestseller ( third only to Uncle Tom ’ s Cabin and Ben Hur among late nineteenth-century publications ) and appealed to those who felt the industrial age of big business was sending the country in the wrong direction . Eugene Debs , who led the national Pullman Railroad Strike in 1894 , later commented on how Bellamy ’ s work influenced him to adopt socialism as the answer to the exploitative industrial capitalist model . In addition , Bellamy ’ s work spurred the publication of no fewer than thirty-six additional books or articles by other writers , either supporting Bellamy ’ s outlook or directly criticizing it . In 1897 , Bellamy felt compelled to publish a sequel , entitled Equality , in which he further explained ideas he had previously introduced concerning educational reform and women ’ s equality , as well as a world of vegetarians who speak a universal language . Another author whose work illustrated the criticisms of the day was nonfiction writer Henry George , an economist best known for his 1879 work Progress and Poverty , which criticized the inequality found in an industrial economy .

Homeowners in traditionally White neighborhoods later entered into covenants in which they agreed not to sell to African American buyers ; they also often fled neighborhoods into which African Americans had gained successful entry .

Students grew less likely to take traditional liberal arts classes in rhetoric , philosophy , and foreign language , and instead focused on preparing for the modern work world . Professional schools for the study of medicine , law , and business also developed .

34,"Churches and civic organizations provided some relief to the challenges of working-class city life . Churches were moved to intervene through their belief in the concept of the social gospel . This philosophy stated that all Christians , whether they were church leaders or social reformers , should be as concerned about the conditions of life in the secular world as the afterlife , and the Reverend Washington Gladden was a major advocate . Rather than preaching sermons on heaven and hell , Gladden talked about social changes of the time , urging other preachers to follow his lead . He advocated for improvements in daily life and encouraged Americans of all classes to work together for the betterment of society . His sermons included the message to “ love thy neighbor ” and held that all Americans had to work together to help the masses . As a result of his influence , churches began to include gymnasiums and libraries as well as offer evening classes on hygiene and health care . Other religious organizations like the Salvation Army and the Young Men ’ s Christian Association ( YMCA ) expanded their reach in American cities at this time as well . Beginning in the 1870s , these organizations began providing community services and other benefits to the urban poor .",1.007991909980774,0.0

34,"By most contemporary accounts , Riis was an effective storyteller , using drama and racial stereotypes to tell his stories of the ethnic slums he encountered . But while his racial thinking was very much a product of his time , he was also a reformer ; he felt strongly that upper and middle-class Americans could and should care about the living conditions of the poor . In his book and lectures , he argued against the immoral landlords and useless laws that allowed dangerous living conditions and high rents . He also suggested remodeling existing tenements or building new ones . He was not alone in his concern for the plight of the poor ; other reporters and activists had already brought the issue into the public eye , and Riis ’ s photographs added a new element to the story .",0.020392533391714096,0.0
34,"Between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the Great Depression , nearly two million African Americans fled the rural South to seek new opportunities elsewhere . While some moved west , the vast majority of this Great Migration , as the large exodus of African Americans leaving the South in the early twentieth century was called , traveled to the Northeast and Upper Midwest . The following cities were the primary destinations for these African Americans : New York , Chicago , Philadelphia , St . Louis , Detroit , Pittsburgh , Cleveland , and Indianapolis . These eight cities accounted for over two-thirds of the total population of the African American migration .",0.958530068397522,0.0

34,"As the country grew , certain elements led some towns to morph into large urban centers , while others did not . The following four innovations proved critical in shaping urbanization at the turn of the century : electric lighting , communication improvements , intracity transportation , and the rise of skyscrapers . As people migrated for the new jobs , they often struggled with the absence of basic urban infrastructures , such as better transportation , adequate housing , means of communication , and efficient sources of light and energy . Even the basic necessities , such as fresh water and proper sanitation — often taken for granted in the countryside — presented a greater challenge in urban life .",0.41911056637763977,1.0
34,"As new opportunities for the middle class threatened the austerity of upper-class citizens , including the newer forms of transportation that allowed middle-class Americans to travel with greater ease , wealthier Americans sought unique ways to further set themselves apart in society . These included more expensive excursions , such as vacations in Newport , Rhode Island , winter relocation to sunny Florida , and frequent trips aboard steamships to Europe . For those who were not of the highly respected “ old money , ” but only recently obtained their riches through business ventures , the relief they sought came in the form of one book — the annual Social Register . First published in 1886 by Louis Keller in New York City , the register became a directory of the wealthy socialites who populated the city . Keller updated it annually , and people would watch with varying degrees of anxiety or complacency to see their names appear in print . Also called the Blue Book , the register was instrumental in the planning of society dinners , balls , and other social events . For those of newer wealth , there was relief found simply in the notion that they and others witnessed their wealth through the publication of their names in the register .",0.9117971062660217,0.0
34,"As cities grew and sprawled outward , a major challenge was efficient travel within the city — from home to factories or shops , and then back again . Most transportation infrastructure was used to connect cities to each other , typically by rail or canal . Prior to the 1880s , two of the most common forms of transportation within cities were the omnibus and the horse car . An omnibus was a large , horse-drawn carriage . A horse car was similar to an omnibus , but it was placed on iron or steel tracks to provide a smoother ride . While these horse-driven vehicles worked adequately in smaller , less-congested cities , they were not equipped to handle the larger crowds that developed at the close of the century . The horses had to stop and rest , and horse manure became an ongoing problem . In 1887 , Frank Sprague invented the electric trolley , which worked along the same concept as the horse car , with a large wagon on tracks , but was powered by electricity rather than horses . The electric trolley could run throughout the day and night , like the factories and the workers who fueled them . But it also modernized less important industrial centers , such as the southern city of Richmond , Virginia . As early as 1873 , San Francisco engineers adopted pulley technology from the mining industry to introduce cable cars and turn the city ’ s steep hills into elegant middle-class communities . However , as crowds continued to grow in the largest cities , such as Chicago and New York , trolleys were unable to move efficiently through the crowds of pedestrians ( Figure 19.4 ) . To avoid this challenge , city planners elevated the trolley lines above the streets , creating elevated trains , or L-trains , as early as 1868 in New York City , and quickly spreading to Boston in 1887 and Chicago in 1892 . Finally , as skyscrapers began to dominate the air , transportation evolved one step further to move underground as subways . Boston ’ s subway system began operating in 1897 , and was quickly followed by New York and other cities .",1.0180437564849854,0.0
34,"Another critique of late nineteenth-century American capitalism was Thorstein Veblen , who lamented in The Theory of the Leisure Class ( 1899 ) that capitalism created a middle class more preoccupied with its own comfort and consumption than with maximizing production . In coining the phrase “ conspicuous consumption , ” Veblen identified the means by which one class of nonproducers exploited the working class that produced the goods for their consumption . Such practices , including the creation of business trusts , served only to create a greater divide between the haves and have-nots in American society , and resulted in economic inefficiencies that required correction or reform .",0.9541107416152954,1.0
34,"Another common form of popular entertainment was vaudeville — large stage variety shows that included everything from singing , dancing , and comedy acts to live animals and magic . The vaudeville circuit gave rise to several prominent performers , including magician Harry Houdini , who began his career in these variety shows before his fame propelled him to solo acts . In addition to live theater shows , it was primarily working-class citizens who enjoyed the advent of the nickelodeon , a forerunner to the movie theater . The first nickelodeon opened in Pittsburgh in 1905 , where nearly one hundred visitors packed into a storefront theater to see a traditional vaudeville show interspersed with one-minute film clips . Several theaters initially used the films as “ chasers ” to indicate the end of the show to the live audience so they would clear the auditorium . However , a vaudeville performers ’ strike generated even greater interest in the films , eventually resulting in the rise of modern movie theaters by 1910 .",0.9911333322525024,0.0
34,"Although cities such as Philadelphia , Boston , and New York sprang up from the initial days of colonial settlement , the explosion in urban population growth did not occur until the mid-nineteenth century ( Figure 19.3 ) . At this time , the attractions of city life , and in particular , employment opportunities , grew exponentially due to rapid changes in industrialization . Before the mid - 1800s , factories , such as the early textile mills , had to be located near rivers and seaports , both for the transport of goods and the necessary water power . Production became dependent upon seasonal water flow , with cold , icy winters all but stopping river transportation entirely . The development of the steam engine transformed this need , allowing businesses to locate their factories near urban centers . These factories encouraged more and more people to move to urban areas where jobs were plentiful , but hourly wages were often low and the work was routine and grindingly monotonous .",1.0049004554748535,0.0
34,"Although a few suburbs existed in the United States prior to the 1880s ( such as Llewellyn Park , New Jersey ) , the introduction of the electric railway generated greater interest and growth during the last decade of the century . The ability to travel from home to work on a relatively quick and cheap mode of transportation encouraged more Americans of modest means to consider living away from the chaos of the city . Eventually , Henry Ford ’ s popularization of the automobile , specifically in terms of a lower price , permitted more families to own cars and thus consider suburban life . Later in the twentieth century , both the advent of the interstate highway system , along with federal legislation designed to allow families to construct homes with low-interest loans , further sparked the suburban phenomenon .",0.7397528290748596,0.0
34,"African American poet , playwright , and novelist of the realist period , Paul Laurence Dunbar dealt with issues of race at a time when most reform-minded Americans preferred to focus on other issues . Through his combination of writing in both standard English and Black dialect , Dunbar delighted readers with his rich portrayals of the successes and struggles associated with African American life . Although he initially struggled to find the patronage and financial support required to develop a full-time literary career , Dunbar ’ s subsequent professional relationship with literary critic and Atlantic Monthly editor William Dean Howells helped to firmly cement his literary credentials as the foremost African American writer of his generation . As with Chopin and Harding , Dunbar ’ s writing highlighted parts of the American experience that were not well understood by the dominant demographic of the country . In their work , these authors provided readers with insights into a world that was not necessarily familiar to them and also gave hidden communities — be it iron mill workers , southern women , or African American men — a sense of voice .",0.20243331789970398,0.0
34,"A combination of both “ push ” and “ pull ” factors played a role in this movement . Despite the end of the Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth Amendments to the U . S . Constitution ( ending slavery , ensuring equal protection under the law , and protecting the right to vote , respectively ) , African Americans were still subjected to intense racial hatred . The rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War led to increased death threats , violence , and a wave of lynchings . Even after the formal dismantling of the Klan in the late 1870s , racially motivated violence continued . According to researchers at the Tuskegee Institute , there were thirty-five hundred racially motivated lynchings and other murders committed in the South between 1865 and 1900 . For African Americans fleeing this culture of violence , northern and midwestern cities offered an opportunity to escape the dangers of the South . In addition to this “ push ” out of the South , African Americans were also “ pulled ” to the cities by factors that attracted them , including job opportunities , where they could earn a wage rather than be tied to a landlord , and the chance to vote ( for men , at least ) , supposedly free from the threat of violence . Although many lacked the funds to move themselves north , factory owners and other businesses that sought cheap labor assisted the migration . Often , the men moved first then sent for their families once they were ensconced in their new city life . Racism and a lack of formal education relegated these African American workers to many of the lower-paying unskilled or semi-skilled occupations . More than 80 percent of African American men worked menial jobs in steel mills , mines , construction , and meat packing . In the railroad industry , they were often employed as porters or servants ( Figure 19.8 ) . In other businesses , they worked as janitors , waiters , or cooks . African American women , who faced discrimination due to both their race and gender , found a few job opportunities in the garment industry or laundries , but were more often employed as maids and domestic servants . Regardless of the status of their jobs , however , African Americans earned higher wages in the North than they did for the same occupations in the South , and typically found housing to be more available .",0.7415631413459778,1.0

For example , if you borrowed $ 20,000 , and made sixty equal monthly payments , your monthly payment would be $ 415.17 , and your interest expense component of the $ 415.17 payment would be $ 150.00 .

See Figure 13.7 for an exhibit that demonstrates this concept . Concepts In Practice Applying Amortization Car loans , mortgages , and education loans have an amortization process to pay down debt . Amortization of a loan requires periodic scheduled payments of principal and interest until the loan is paid in full . Every period , the same payment amount is due , but interest expense is paid first , with the remainder of the payment going toward the principal balance . When a customer first takes out the loan , most of the scheduled payment is made up of interest , and a very small amount goes to reducing the principal balance .

For company members with stock options , this could result in higher income .

The tendency for movement in this way is much like water accumulated on one side of a dam , moving through the dam when opened . ATP synthase ( like a combination of the intake and generator of a hydroelectric dam ) is a complex protein that acts as a tiny generator , turning by the force of the H + diffusing through the enzyme , down their electrochemical gradient from where there are many mutually repelling H + to where there are fewer H + .

Thus , the 10 NADH molecules made per glucose during glycolysis , the transition reaction , and the Krebs cycle carry enough energy to make 30 ATP molecules , whereas the two FADH 2 molecules made per glucose during these processes provide enough energy to make four ATP molecules . Overall , the theoretical maximum yield of ATP made during the complete aerobic respiration of glucose is 38 molecules , with four being made by substrate-level phosphorylation and 34 being made by oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 8.16 ) .

36,"The energy released from the breakdown of the chemical bonds within nutrients can be stored either through the reduction of electron carriers or in the bonds of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . In living systems , a small class of compounds functions as mobile electron carrier s , molecules that bind to and shuttle high-energy electrons between compounds in pathways . The principal electron carriers we will consider originate from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides ; they are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate , and flavin adenine dinucleotide . These compounds can be easily reduced or oxidized . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + / NADH ) is the most common mobile electron carrier used in catabolism . NAD + is the oxidized form of the molecule ; NADH is the reduced form of the molecule . Nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP + ) , the oxidized form of an NAD + variant that contains an extra phosphate group , is another important electron carrier ; it forms NADPH when reduced . The oxidized form of flavin adenine dinucleotide is FAD , and its reduced form is FADH 2 . Both NAD + / NADH and FAD / FADH 2 are extensively used in energy extraction from sugars during catabolism in chemoheterotroph s , whereas NADP + / NADPH plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis .

36,"The electron transport system ( ETS ) is the last component involved in the process of cellular respiration ; it comprises a series of membrane-associated protein complexes and associated mobile accessory electron carriers ( Figure 8.15 ) . Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons from NADH and FADH 2 are passed rapidly from one ETS electron carrier to the next . These carriers can pass electrons along in the ETS because of their redox potential . For a protein or chemical to accept electrons , it must have a more positive redox potential than the electron donor . Therefore , electrons move from electron carriers with more negative redox potential to those with more positive redox potential . The four major classes of electron carriers involved in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic electron transport systems are the cytochrome s , flavoprotein s , iron-sulfur protein s , and the quinone s . In aerobic respiration , the final electron acceptor ( i . e . , the one having the most positive redox potential ) at the end of the ETS is an oxygen molecule ( O 2 ) that becomes reduced to water ( H 2 O ) by the final ETS carrier . This electron carrier , cytochrome oxidase , differs between bacterial types and can be used to differentiate closely related bacteria for diagnoses . For example , the gram-negative opportunist Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-negative cholera-causing Vibrio cholerae use cytochrome c oxidase , which can be detected by the oxidase test , whereas other gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae , like E . coli , are negative for this test because they produce different cytochrome oxidase types .",1.0102332830429077,1.0

36,"Enzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity . There are many different kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function , and various mechanisms exist for doing so ( Figure 8.8 ) . A competitive inhibitor is a molecule similar enough to a substrate that it can compete with the substrate for binding to the active site by simply blocking the substrate from binding . For a competitive inhibitor to be effective , the inhibitor concentration needs to be approximately equal to the substrate concentration . Sulfa drugs provide a good example of competitive competition . They are used to treat bacterial infections because they bind to the active site of an enzyme within the bacterial folic acid synthesis pathway . When present in a sufficient dose , a sulfa drug prevents folic acid synthesis , and bacteria are unable to grow because they cannot synthesize DNA , RNA , and proteins . Humans are unaffected because we obtain folic acid from our diets .",1.0169085264205933,1.0

High temperatures will eventually cause enzymes , like other biological molecules , to denature , losing their three-dimensional structure and function . Enzymes are also suited to function best within a certain pH range , and , as with temperature , extreme environmental pH values ( acidic or basic ) can cause enzymes to denature .

Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . ATP is often called the “ energy currency ” of the cell , and , like currency , this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell . At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) , which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and a single phosphate group . Ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in RNA , and AMP is one of the nucleotides in RNA . The addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) ; the addition of a third phosphate group forms ATP ( Figure 8.3 ) . Adding a phosphate group to a molecule , a process called phosphorylation , requires energy . Phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in series , as they are in ADP and ATP . This repulsion makes the ADP and ATP molecules inherently unstable . Thus , the bonds between phosphate groups ( one in ADP and two in ATP ) are called high-energy phosphate bond s . When these high-energy bonds are broken to release one phosphate ( called inorganic phosphate [ P i ] ) or two connected phosphate groups ( called pyrophosphate [ PP i ] ) from ATP through a process called dephosphorylation , energy is released to drive endergonic reaction s ( Figure 8.4 ) .",0.9680768251419067,0.0

Often , a company can expect that their production and sales volume will vary from budget period to budget period . They can use their various expected levels of production to create a flexible budget that includes these different levels of production . Then , they can modify the flexible budget when they have their actual production volume and compare it to the flexible budget for the same production volume . A flexible budget is more complicated , requires a solid understanding of a company ’ s fixed and variable expenses , and allows for greater control over changes that occur throughout the year . For example , suppose a proposed sale of items does not occur because the expected client opted to go with another supplier . In a static budget situation , this would result in large variances in many accounts due to the static budget being set based on sales that included the potential large client . A flexible budget on the other hand would allow management to adjust their expectations in the budget for both changes in costs and revenue that would occur from the loss of the potential client . The changes made in the flexible budget would then be compared to what actually occurs to result in more realistic and representative variance . This ability to change the budget also makes it easier to pinpoint who is responsible if a revenue or cost target is missed .",0.9832495450973511,0.0

Clearly , emotion-focused coping is more effective in dealing with uncontrollable stressors . For example , if at midnight you are stressing over a 40 - page paper due in the morning that you have not yet started , you are probably better off recognizing the hopelessness of the situation and doing something to take your mind off it ; taking a problem-focused approach by trying to accomplish this task would only lead to frustration , anxiety , and even more stress .",1.0113288164138794,1.0
39,"When stress is extreme or chronic , it can have profoundly negative consequences . For example , stress often contributes to the development of certain psychological disorders , including post-traumatic stress disorder , major depressive disorder , and other serious psychiatric conditions . Additionally , we noted earlier that stress is linked to the development and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases . For example , researchers in one study found that people injured during the September 11 , 2001 , World Trade Center disaster or who developed post-traumatic stress symptoms afterward later suffered significantly elevated rates of heart disease ( Jordan , Miller-Archie , Cone , Morabia , & Stellman , 2011 ) .

39,"When evaluating these findings , it is important to remember that there is a tangible physiological connection between the brain and the immune system . For example , the sympathetic nervous system innervates immune organs such as the thymus , bone marrow , spleen , and even lymph nodes ( Maier , Watkins , & Fleshner , 1994 ) . Also , we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis activation can adversely impact immune function . One way they do this is by inhibiting the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells that circulate in the body ’ s fluids that are important in the immune response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) .",0.8051597476005554,1.0

39,"What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ? The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis . When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’ s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands . Release of these hormones activates the fight-or-flight responses to stress , such as accelerated heart rate and respiration . At the same time , the HPA axis , which is primarily endocrine in nature , becomes especially active , although it works much more slowly than the sympathetic nervous system . In response to stress , the hypothalamus ( one of the limbic structures in the brain ) releases corticotrophin-releasing factor , a hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) ( Figure 14.11 ) . The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream ; an important one is cortisol , which can affect virtually every organ within the body . Cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor , preparing us to run away or fight . However , sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system .",0.9642431735992432,1.0

In addition to studying the connection between stress and illness , health psychologists investigate issues such as why people make certain lifestyle choices ( e . g . , smoking or eating unhealthy food despite knowing the potential adverse health implications of such behaviors ) . Health psychologists also design and investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at changing unhealthy behaviors . Perhaps one of the more fundamental tasks of health psychologists is to identify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes , based on psychological or behavioral factors .

Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person ’ s neuromuscular and autonomic activity — feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals . The main assumption of this approach is that providing somebody biofeedback will enable the individual to develop strategies that help gain some level of voluntary control over what are normally involuntary bodily processes ( Schwartz & Schwartz , 1995 ) . A number of different bodily measures have been used in biofeedback research , including facial muscle movement , brain activity , and skin temperature , and it has been applied successfully with individuals experiencing tension headaches , high blood pressure , asthma , and phobias ( Stein , 2001 ) . 14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",1.012075424194336,0.0
39,"The reformulated version of Seligman ’ s study holds that the attributions made for negative life events contribute to depression . Consider the example of a student who performs poorly on a midterm exam . This model suggests that the student will make three kinds of attributions for this outcome : internal vs . external ( believing the outcome was caused by his own personal inadequacies or by environmental factors ) , stable vs . unstable ( believing the cause can be changed or is permanent ) , and global vs . specific ( believing the outcome is a sign of inadequacy in most everything versus just this area ) . Assume that the student makes an internal ( “ I ’ m just not smart ” ) , stable ( “ Nothing can be done to change the fact that I ’ m not smart ” ) and global ( “ This is another example of how lousy I am at everything ” ) attribution for the poor performance . The reformulated theory predicts that the student would perceive a lack of control over this stressful event and thus be especially prone to developing depression . Indeed , research has demonstrated that people who have a tendency to make internal , global , and stable attributions for bad outcomes tend to develop symptoms of depression when faced with negative life experiences ( Peterson & Seligman , 1984 ) .",0.9828024506568909,0.0

39,"The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal : judgment of the options available to cope with a stressor , as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be ( Lyon , 2012 ) ( Figure 14.3 ) . As you may recall from what you learned about self-efficacy , an individual ’ s belief in his ability to complete a task is important ( Bandura , 1994 ) . A threat tends to be viewed as less catastrophic if one believes something can be done about it ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) . Imagine that two middle-aged women , Robin and Maria , perform breast self-examinations one morning and each woman notices a lump on the lower region of her left breast . Although both women view the breast lump as a potential threat ( primary appraisal ) , their secondary appraisals differ considerably . In considering the breast lump , some of the thoughts racing through Robin ’ s mind are , “ Oh my God , I could have breast cancer ! What if the cancer has spread to the rest of my body and I cannot recover ? What if I have to go through chemotherapy ? I ’ ve heard that experience is awful ! What if I have to quit my job ? My husband and I won ’ t have enough money to pay the mortgage . Oh , this is just horrible … I can ’ t deal with it ! ” On the other hand , Maria thinks , “ Hmm , this may not be good . Although most times these things turn out to be benign , I need to have it checked out . If it turns out to be breast cancer , there are doctors who can take care of it because the medical technology today is quite advanced . I ’ ll have a lot of different options , and I ’ ll be just fine . ” Clearly , Robin and Maria have different outlooks on what might turn out to be a very serious situation : Robin seems to think that little could be done about it , whereas Maria believes that , worst case scenario , a number of options that are likely to be effective would be available . As such , Robin would clearly experience greater stress than would Maria .",0.101005420088768,0.0
39,"The need to form and maintain strong , stable relationships with others is a powerful , pervasive , and fundamental human motive ( Baumeister & Leary , 1995 ) . Building strong interpersonal relationships with others helps us establish a network of close , caring individuals who can provide social support in times of distress , sorrow , and fear . Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends , family , and acquaintances ( Baron & Kerr , 2003 ) . Social support can take many forms , including advice , guidance , encouragement , acceptance , emotional comfort , and tangible assistance ( such as financial help ) . Thus , other people can be very comforting to us when we are faced with a wide range of life stressors , and they can be extremely helpful in our efforts to manage these challenges . Even in nonhuman animals , species mates can offer social support during times of stress . For example , elephants seem to be able to sense when other elephants are stressed and will often comfort them with physical contact — such as a trunk touch — or an empathetic vocal response ( Krumboltz , 2014 ) .",0.9789780974388123,0.0

In general , research has found that more affluent individuals experience better health mainly because they tend to believe that they can personally control and manage their reactions to life ’ s stressors ( Johnson & Krueger , 2006 ) . Perhaps buoyed by the perceived level of control , individuals of higher social class may be prone to overestimating the degree of influence they have over particular outcomes . For example , those of higher social class tend to believe that their votes have greater sway on election outcomes than do those of lower social class , which may explain higher rates of voting in more affluent communities ( Krosnick , 1990 ) . Other research has found that a sense of perceived control can protect less affluent individuals from poorer health , depression , and reduced life-satisfaction — all of which tend to accompany lower social standing ( Lachman & Weaver , 1998 ) .",0.8946900963783264,0.0

Alarm reaction describes the body ’ s immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency , and it is roughly analogous to the fight-or-flight response described by Cannon . During an alarm reaction , you are alerted to a stressor , and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation .

39,"The desire and ability to predict events , make decisions , and affect outcomes — that is , to enact control in our lives — is a basic tenet of human behavior ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) . Albert Bandura ( 1997 ) stated that “ the intensity and chronicity of human stress is governed largely by perceived control over the demands of one ’ s life ” ( p . 262 ) . As cogently described in his statement , our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large extent on how much control we feel we have over such things . Perceived control is our beliefs about our personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes , and it has major implications for our health and happiness ( Infurna & Gerstorf , 2014 ) . Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes , such as better physical and mental health and greater psychological well-being ( Diehl & Hay , 2010 ) . Greater personal control is also associated with lower reactivity to stressors in daily life . For example , researchers in one investigation found that higher levels of perceived control at one point in time were later associated with lower emotional and physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors ( Neupert , Almeida , & Charles , 2007 ) . Further , a daily diary study with 34 older widows found that their stress and anxiety levels were significantly reduced on days during which the widows felt greater perceived control ( Ong , Bergeman , & Bisconti , 2005 ) .",0.9799014329910278,0.0

Despite its widespread use , the scale has been subject to criticism . First , many of the items on the SRRS are vague ; for example , death of a close friend could involve the death of a long-absent childhood friend that requires little social readjustment ( Dohrenwend , 2006 ) . In addition , some have challenged its assumption that undesirable life events are no more stressful than desirable ones ( Derogatis & Coons , 1993 ) . However , most of the available evidence suggests that , at least as far as mental health is concerned , undesirable or negative events are more strongly associated with poor outcomes ( such as depression ) than are desirable , positive events ( Hatch & Dohrenwend , 2007 ) . Perhaps the most serious criticism is that the scale does not take into consideration respondents ’ appraisals of the life events it contains . As you recall , appraisal of a stressor is a key element in the conceptualization and overall experience of stress . Being fired from work may be devastating to some but a welcome opportunity to obtain a better job for others . The SRRS remains one of the most well-known instruments in the study of stress , and it is a useful tool for identifying potential stress-related health outcomes ( Scully et al . , 2000 ) .",0.9938608407974243,1.0

Qualities that help promote psychological well-being ( e . g . , having meaning and purpose in life , a sense of autonomy , positive emotions , and satisfaction with life ) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes ( especially improved cardiovascular health ) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors ( such as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) ( Boehm & Kubzansky , 2012 ) . The quality that has received attention is positive affect , which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment , such as happiness , joy , enthusiasm , alertness , and excitement ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) . The characteristics of positive affect , as with negative affect ( discussed earlier ) , can be brief , long-lasting , or trait-like ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) .

Franz Alexander ( 1950 ) , an early - 20th - century psychoanalyst and physician , once postulated that various diseases are caused by specific unconscious conflicts . For example , he linked hypertension to repressed anger , asthma to separation anxiety , and ulcers to an unconscious desire to “ remain in the dependent infantile situation — to be loved and cared for ” ( Alexander , 1950 , p . 102 ) . Although hypertension does appear to be linked to anger ( as you will learn below ) , Alexander ’ s assertions have not been supported by research . Years later , Friedman and Booth-Kewley ( 1987 ) , after statistically reviewing 101 studies examining the link between personality and illness , proposed the existence of disease-prone personality characteristics , including depression , anger / hostility , and anxiety . Indeed , a study of over 61,000 Norwegians identified depression as a risk factor for all major disease-related causes of death ( Mykletun et al . , 2007 ) .

Selye realized that these responses were triggered by a coordinated series of physiological reactions that unfold over time during continued exposure to a stressor .

Therefore , Seligman speculated that acquiring a sense of learned helplessness might be an important cause of depression in humans : Humans who experience negative life events that they believe they are unable to control may become helpless .

For example , although people generally tend to adapt to marriage so that it no longer makes them happier or unhappier than before , they often do not fully adapt to unemployment or severe disabilities ( Diener , 2012 ) . Figure 14.28 , which is based on longitudinal data from a sample of over 3,000 German respondents , shows life satisfaction scores several years before , during , and after various life events , and it illustrates how people adapt ( or fail to adapt ) to these events .

Many studies over the years have demonstrated that some people with asthma will experience asthma-like symptoms if they expect to experience such symptoms , such as when breathing an inert substance that they ( falsely ) believe will lead to airway obstruction ( Sodergren & Hyland , 1999 ) .

39,"Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg ( 1937 ) , who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia ( an archaic term for depression ) was six times higher than that of the population . A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over 8,000 manic-depressive persons in Denmark , finding a nearly 50 % increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population ( Weeke , 1979 ) . By the early 1990s , evidence began to accumulate showing that depressed individuals who were followed for long periods of time were at increased risk for heart disease and cardiac death ( Glassman , 2007 ) . In one investigation of over 700 Denmark residents , those with the highest depression scores were 71 % more likely to have experienced a heart attack than were those with lower depression scores ( Barefoot & Schroll , 1996 ) .

39,"People with asthma tend to report and display a high level of negative emotions such as anxiety , and asthma attacks have been linked to periods of high emotionality ( Lehrer , Isenberg , & Hochron , 1993 ) . In addition , high levels of emotional distress during both laboratory tasks and daily life have been found to negatively affect airway function and can produce asthma-like symptoms in people with asthma ( von Leupoldt , Ehnes , & Dahme , 2006 ) . In one investigation , 20 adults with asthma wore preprogrammed wristwatches that signaled them to breathe into a portable device that measures airway function . Results showed that higher levels of negative emotions and stress were associated with increased airway obstruction and self-reported asthma symptoms ( Smyth , Soefer , Hurewitz , Kliment , & Stone , 1999 ) . In addition , D ’ Amato , Liccardi , Cecchi , Pellegrino , & D ’ Amato ( 2010 ) described a case study of an 18 - year-old man with asthma whose girlfriend had broken up with him , leaving him in a depressed state . She had also unfriended him on Facebook , while friending other young males . Eventually , the young man was able to “ friend ” her once again and could monitor her activity through Facebook . Subsequently , he would experience asthma symptoms whenever he logged on and accessed her profile . When he later resigned not to use Facebook any longer , the asthma attacks stopped .

These conceptualizations are referred to as response-based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions . For example , the endocrinologist Hans Selye , a famous stress researcher , once defined stress as the “ response of the body to any demand , whether it is caused by , or results in , pleasant or unpleasant conditions ” ( Selye , 1976 , p . 74 ) . Selye ’ s definition of stress is response-based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body ’ s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it . Neither stimulus-based nor response-based definitions provide a complete definition of stress . Many of the physiological reactions that occur when faced with demanding situations ( e . g . , accelerated heart rate ) can also occur in response to things that most people would not consider to be genuinely stressful , such as receiving unanticipated good news : an unexpected promotion or raise .",1.0159462690353394,0.0

39,"Lazarus and Folkman ( 1984 ) distinguished two fundamental kinds of coping : problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping . In problem-focused coping , one attempts to manage or alter the problem that is causing one to experience stress ( i . e . , the stressor ) . Problem-focused coping strategies are similar to strategies used in everyday problem-solving : they typically involve identifying the problem , considering possible solutions , weighing the costs and benefits of these solutions , and then selecting an alternative ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) . As an example , suppose Bradford receives a midterm notice that he is failing statistics class . If Bradford adopts a problem-focused coping approach to managing his stress , he would be proactive in trying to alleviate the source of the stress .

However , extended release of cortisol — as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress — often comes at a high price . High levels of cortisol have been shown to produce a number of harmful effects . For example , increases in cortisol can significantly weaken our immune system ( Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser , 2005 ) , and high levels are frequently observed among depressed individuals ( Geoffroy , Hertzman , Li , & Power , 2013 ) . In summary , a stressful event causes a variety of physiological reactions that activate the adrenal glands , which in turn release epinephrine , norepinephrine , and cortisol .

Nevertheless , Selye ’ s model has had an enormous impact on the field of stress because it offers a general explanation for how stress can lead to physical damage and , thus , disease .

Negative affectivity is a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger , contempt , disgust , guilt , fear , and nervousness ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) . It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart disease . For example , over 3,000 initially healthy participants in one study were tracked longitudinally , up to 22 years . Those with higher levels of negative affectivity at the time the study began were substantially more likely to develop and be treated for hypertension during the ensuing years than were those with lower levels of negative affectivity ( Jonas & Lando , 2000 ) . In addition , a study of over 10,000 middle-aged London-based civil servants who were followed an average of 12.5 years revealed that those who earlier had scored in the upper third on a test of negative affectivity were 32 % more likely to have experienced heart disease , heart attack , or angina over a period of years than were those who scored in the lowest third ( Nabi , Kivimaki , De Vogli , Marmot , & Singh-Manoux , 2008 ) .

At one point during your hike , a large , frightening-looking black bear appears from behind a stand of trees and sits about 50 yards from you . The bear notices you , sits up , and begins to lumber in your direction . In addition to thinking , “ This is definitely not good , ” a constellation of physiological reactions begins to take place inside you .

Your heart starts to pound and speeds up , you begin to breathe heavily and perspire , you get butterflies in your stomach , and your muscles become tense , preparing you to take some kind of direct action . Cannon proposed that this reaction , which he called the fight-or-flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions — especially those associated with a perceived threat ( Cannon , 1932 ) . During the fight-or-flight response , the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( Figure 14.8 ) .

Also , someone exposed to high levels of the stress hormone cortisol might become vulnerable to infection or disease because of weakened immune system functioning ( McEwen , 1998 ) .",0.06462743133306503,0.0
39,"If exposure to a stressor is prolonged , the organism will enter the stage of resistance . During this stage , the initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor . Nevertheless , the body also remains on alert and is prepared to respond as it did during the alarm reaction , although with less intensity . For example , suppose a child who went missing is still missing 72 hours later . Although the parents would obviously remain extremely disturbed , the magnitude of physiological reactions would likely have diminished over the 72 intervening hours due to some adaptation to this event .",0.029221976175904274,0.0
39,"If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time , the stage of exhaustion ensues . At this stage , the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor : the body ’ s ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body ’ s tissues and organs . As a result , illness , disease , and other permanent damage to the body — even death — may occur . If a missing child still remained missing after three months , the long-term stress associated with this situation may cause a parent to literally faint with exhaustion at some point or even to develop a serious and irreversible illness .",0.13681648671627045,1.0
39,"If a person appraises an event as harmful and believes that the demands imposed by the event exceed the available resources to manage or adapt to it , the person will subjectively experience a state of stress . In contrast , if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening , she is unlikely to experience stress . According to this definition , environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they are interpreted and the meanings they are assigned . In short , stress is largely in the eye of the beholder : it ’ s not so much what happens to you as it is how you respond ( Selye , 1976 ) .",1.0048182010650635,1.0
39,"Hundreds of studies involving tens of thousands of participants have tested many kinds of brief and chronic stressors and their effect on the immune system ( e . g . , public speaking , medical school examinations , unemployment , marital discord , divorce , death of spouse , burnout and job strain , caring for a relative with Alzheimer ’ s disease , and exposure to the harsh climate of Antarctica ) . It has been repeatedly demonstrated that many kinds of stressors are associated with poor or weakened immune functioning ( Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser , 2005 ; Kiecolt-Glaser , McGuire , Robles , & Glaser , 2002 ; Segerstrom & Miller , 2004 ) .",0.06439075618982315,0.0
39,"However , something similar to sensory adaptation often occurs when people experience emotional reactions to life events . In much the same way our senses adapt to changes in stimulation ( e . g . , our eyes adapting to bright light after walking out of the darkness of a movie theater into the bright afternoon sun ) , we eventually adapt to changing emotional circumstances in our lives ( Brickman & Campbell , 1971 ; Helson , 1964 ) . When an event that provokes positive or negative emotions occurs , at first we tend to experience its emotional impact at full intensity . We feel a burst of pleasure following such things as a marriage proposal , birth of a child , acceptance to law school , an inheritance , and the like ; as you might imagine , lottery winners experience a surge of happiness after hitting the jackpot ( Lutter , 2007 ) . Likewise , we experience a surge of misery following widowhood , a divorce , or a layoff from work . In the long run , however , we eventually adjust to the emotional new normal ; the emotional impact of the event tends to erode , and we eventually revert to our original baseline happiness levels . Thus , what was at first a thrilling lottery windfall or World Series championship eventually loses its luster and becomes the status quo ( Figure 14.27 ) . Indeed , dramatic life events have much less long-lasting impact on happiness than might be expected ( Brickman , Coats , & Janoff-Bulman , 1978 ) .",0.8138934373855591,0.0

39,"Good Stress ? Although stress carries a negative connotation , at times it may be of some benefit . Stress can motivate us to do things in our best interests , such as study for exams , visit the doctor regularly , exercise , and perform to the best of our ability at work . Indeed , Selye ( 1974 ) pointed out that not all stress is harmful . He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive , motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives . This kind of stress , which Selye called eustress ( from the Greek eu = “ good ” ) , is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings , optimal health , and performance . A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations . For example , athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress , and students may experience similar beneficial stress before a major exam . Indeed , research shows that moderate stress can enhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material . Male participants in one study who memorized a scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild stressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor ( Hupbach & Fieman , 2012 ) .",1.013370156288147,0.0

39,"Given the complex and pervasive nature of racism as a stressor , Brondolo et al . ( 2009 ) point out the importance of coping with this specific stressor . Their review is aimed at determining which coping strategies are most effective at offsetting negative health outcomes associated with racism-related stress . The authors examine the effectiveness of three coping strategies : focusing on racial identity to handle race-related stress , anger expression / suppression , and seeking social support . You ’ ve learned a bit about social support , so we ’ ll focus the remainder of this discussion on the potential coping strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression / suppression . Focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he belongs to a given racial group ; this may increase a sense of pride associated with group membership . Brondolo et al . ( 2009 ) suggest that a strong sense of racial identity might help an individual who is the target of racism differentiate between prejudicial attitudes / behaviors that are directed toward his group as a whole rather than at him as a person . Furthermore , the sense of belonging to his group might alleviate the distress of being ostracized by others . However , the research literature on the effectiveness of this technique has produced mixed results . Anger expression / suppression refers to the options available as a function of the anger evoked by racial prejudice and discrimination . Put simply , a target of racist attitudes and behaviors can act upon her anger or suppress her anger . As discussed by Brondolo et al . ( 2009 ) , there has been very little research on the effectiveness of either approach ; the results are quite mixed with some showing anger expression and others showing anger suppression as the healthier option .",0.986725389957428,0.0

What can be done ? If real life social support is lacking , access to distant friends via social media may help compensate . In a study of college freshmen , those with few face-to-face friends on campus but who communicated electronically with distant friends were less distressed that those who did not ( Raney & Troop-Gordon , 2012 ) .

Chronic stressors include events that persist over an extended period of time , such as caring for a parent with dementia , long-term unemployment , or imprisonment . Acute stressors involve brief focal events that sometimes continue to be experienced as overwhelming well after the event has ended , such as falling on an icy sidewalk and breaking your leg ( Cohen , Janicki-Deverts , & Miller , 2007 ) . Whether chronic or acute , potential stressors come in many shapes and sizes .

However , from 2006 to 2009 the greatest increase in stress levels occurred among men , Whites , people aged 45 – 64 , college graduates , and those with full-time employment . One interpretation of these findings is that concerns surrounding the 2008 – 2009 economic downturn ( e . g . , threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of retirement savings ) may have been especially stressful to White , college-educated , employed men with limited time remaining in their working careers .",0.7895909547805786,1.0

39,"Can money buy happiness ? In general , extensive research suggests that the answer is yes , but with several caveats . While a nation ’ s per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) is associated with happiness levels ( Helliwell et al . , 2013 ) , changes in GDP ( which is a less certain index of household income ) bear little relationship to changes in happiness ( Diener , Tay , & Oishi , 2013 ) . On the whole , residents of affluent countries tend to be happier than residents of poor countries ; within countries , wealthy individuals are happier than poor individuals , but the association is much weaker ( Diener & Biswas-Diener , 2002 ) . To the extent that it leads to increases in purchasing power , increases in income are associated with increases in happiness ( Diener , Oishi , & Ryan , 2013 ) . However , income within societies appears to correlate with happiness only up to a point . In a study of over 450,000 U . S . residents surveyed by the Gallup Organization , Kahneman and Deaton ( 2010 ) found that well-being rises with annual income , but only up to $ 75,000 . The average increase in reported well-being for people with incomes greater than $ 75,000 was null . As implausible as these findings might seem — after all , higher incomes would enable people to indulge in Hawaiian vacations , prime seats as sporting events , expensive automobiles , and expansive new homes — higher incomes may impair people ’ s ability to savor and enjoy the small pleasures of life ( Kahneman , 2011 ) . Indeed , researchers in one study found that participants exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savoring a chocolate candy bar and exhibited less enjoyment of this experience than did participants who were not reminded of wealth ( Quoidbach , Dunn , Petrides , & Mikolajczak , 2010 ) .",0.8602833151817322,0.0

The airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of the airways ( leading to thickening of the airway walls ) and a tightening of the muscles around them , resulting in a narrowing of the airways ( Figure 14.21 ) ( American Lung Association , 2010 ) .

39,"Another factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well-being is the ability to derive flow from the things we do in life . Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossing that it becomes worth doing for its own sake ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) . It is usually related to creative endeavors and leisure activities , but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who love studying ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1999 ) . Many of us instantly recognize the notion of flow . In fact , the term derived from respondents ’ spontaneous use of the term when asked to describe how it felt when what they were doing was going well . When people experience flow , they become involved in an activity to the point where they feel they lose themselves in the activity . They effortlessly maintain their concentration and focus , they feel as though they have complete control of their actions , and time seems to pass more quickly than usual ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) . Flow is considered a pleasurable experience , and it typically occurs when people are engaged in challenging activities that require skills and knowledge they know they possess . For example , people would be more likely report flow experiences in relation to their work or hobbies than in relation to eating . When asked the question , “ Do you ever get involved in something so deeply that nothing else seems to matter , and you lose track of time ? ” about 20 % of Americans and Europeans report having these flow-like experiences regularly ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1997 ) .",0.9920153617858887,0.0

In addition , we are often incorrect when estimating how our long-term happiness would change for the better or worse in response to certain life events . For example , it is easy for many of us to imagine how euphoric we would feel if we won the lottery , were asked on a date by an attractive celebrity , or were offered our dream job . It is also easy to understand how long-suffering fans of the Chicago Cubs baseball team , which has not won a World Series championship since 1908 , think they would feel permanently elated if their team would finally win another World Series .

When asked to define the term , people emphasize different aspects of this elusive state . Indeed , happiness is somewhat ambiguous and can be defined from different perspectives ( Martin , 2012 ) . Some people , especially those who are highly committed to their religious faith , view happiness in ways that emphasize virtuosity , reverence , and enlightened spirituality . Others see happiness as primarily contentment — the inner peace and joy that come from deep satisfaction with one ’ s surroundings , relationships with others , accomplishments , and oneself . Still others view happiness mainly as pleasurable engagement with their personal environment — having a career and hobbies that are engaging , meaningful , rewarding , and exciting .

39,"Although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse , they seem to share two common denominators : heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job . Both of these factors contribute to job strain , a work situation that combines excessive job demands and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control ( Karasek & Theorell , 1990 ) . Clearly , many occupations other than the ones listed in Table 14.2 involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that they often involve heavy workloads and little job control ( e . g . , inability to decide when to take breaks ) . Such jobs are often low-status and include those of factory workers , postal clerks , supermarket cashiers , taxi drivers , and short-order cooks . Job strain can have adverse consequences on both physical and mental health ; it has been shown to be associated with increased risk of hypertension ( Schnall & Landsbergis , 1994 ) , heart attacks ( Theorell et al . , 1998 ) , recurrence of heart disease after a first heart attack ( Aboa-Éboulé et al . , 2007 ) , significant weight loss or gain ( Kivimäki et al . , 2006 ) , and major depressive disorder ( Stansfeld , Shipley , Head , & Fuhrer , 2012 ) .

It has also been conceptualized as a tendency to view life ’ s stressors and difficulties as temporary and external to oneself ( Peterson & Steen , 2002 ) . Numerous studies over the years have consistently shown that optimism is linked to longevity , healthier behaviors , fewer postsurgical complications , better immune functioning among men with prostate cancer , and better treatment adherence ( Rasmussen & Wallio , 2008 ) .

39,"After reviewing and statistically summarizing 35 studies from 1983 to 2006 , Chida and Steptoe ( 2009 ) concluded that the bulk of the evidence suggests that anger and hostility constitute serious long-term risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes among both healthy individuals and those already suffering from heart disease . One reason angry and hostile moods might contribute to cardiovascular diseases is that such moods can create social strain , mainly in the form of antagonistic social encounters with others . This strain could then lay the foundation for disease-promoting cardiovascular responses among hostile individuals ( Vella , Kamarck , Flory , & Manuck , 2012 ) . In this transactional model , hostility and social strain form a cycle ( Figure 14.19 ) . For example , suppose Kaitlin has a hostile disposition ; she has a cynical , distrustful attitude toward others and often thinks that other people are out to get her . She is very defensive around people , even those she has known for years , and she is always looking for signs that others are either disrespecting or belittling her . In the shower each morning before work , she often mentally rehearses what she would say to someone who said or did something that angered her , such as making a political statement that was counter to her own ideology .

39,"A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well-being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) . A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ); these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events . Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals . A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well-being that a stressor might entail . A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm , loss , or other negative consequence ; conversely , a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth . For example , an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as a much greater threat if she believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if she viewed it as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally .

40,"Tropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in these areas are ideal for plant growth . Therefore , the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant communities with very high species diversities ( Figure 44.13 ) . Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any other biome ; on average between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare ( 2.5 acres ) of South America . One way to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome . On the forest floor is a sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter . Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage . A layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy — the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves . Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy . These layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants , fungi , animals , and other organisms within the tropical wet forests . For instance , epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants , which typically are not harmed . Epiphytes are found throughout tropical wet forest biomes .

When one compares the annual temperature variation of tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes , the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest becomes apparent . This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth , rather than the seasonal ( spring , summer , and fall ) growth seen in other biomes . In contrast to other ecosystems , tropical ecosystems do not have long days and short days during the yearly cycle . Instead , a constant daily amount of sunlight ( 11 – 12 hrs per day ) provides more solar radiation , thereby , a longer period of time for plant growth . The annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 to 660 cm ( 50 – 200 in ) with some monthly variation . While sunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent , annual rainfall is highly variable .

Halophytic plants are adapted to deal with the salinity resulting from saltwater on their roots or from sea spray . In some halophytes , filters in the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs . Other plants are able to pump oxygen into their roots . Animals , such as mussels and clams ( phylum Mollusca ) , have developed behavioral adaptations that expend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment . When these animals are exposed to low salinity , they stop feeding , close their shells , and switch from aerobic respiration ( in which they use gills ) to anaerobic respiration ( a process that does not require oxygen ) .

The intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because of tides . Organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time , especially during high tide . Therefore , living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time . The shore of the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves , and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage from the pounding action of the waves ( Figure 44.22 ) .

40,"Temperature affects the physiology of living things as well as the density and state of water . Temperature exerts an important influence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) due to metabolic constraints . It is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ); this is a reflection of evolutionary response to typical temperatures . Enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range of temperatures ; enzyme degradation can occur at higher temperatures . Therefore , organisms either must maintain an internal temperature or they must inhabit an environment that will keep the body within a temperature range that supports metabolism . Some animals have adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations , such as seen in hibernation or reptilian torpor . Similarly , some bacteria are adapted to surviving in extremely hot temperatures such as geysers . Such bacteria are examples of extremophiles : organisms that thrive in extreme environments . Temperature can limit the distribution of living things . Animals faced with temperature fluctuations may respond with adaptations , such as migration , in order to survive . Migration , the movement from one place to another , is an adaptation found in many animals , including many that inhabit seasonally cold climates . Migration solves problems related to temperature , locating food , and finding a mate . In migration , for instance , the Arctic Tern ( Sterna paradisaea ) makes a 40,000 km ( 24,000 mi ) round trip flight each year between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding grounds in the Arctic Ocean . Monarch butterflies ( Danaus plexippus ) live in the eastern United States in the warmer months and migrate to Mexico and the southern United States in the wintertime . Some species of mammals also make migratory forays . Reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ) travel about 5,000 km ( 3,100 mi ) each year to find food .

40,"Organismal Ecology Researchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals to live in specific habitats . These adaptations can be morphological , physiological , and behavioral . For instance , the Karner blue butterfly ( Lycaeides melissa samuelis ) ( Figure 44.3 ) is considered a specialist because the females preferentially oviposit ( that is , lay eggs ) on wild lupine . This preferential adaptation means that the Karner blue butterfly is highly dependent on the presence of wild lupine plants for its continued survival . After hatching , the larval caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine ( Figure 44.4 ) . The caterpillars pupate ( undergo metamorphosis ) and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks . The adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species .

When there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus ( from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms , for example ) , the growth of algae skyrockets , resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom . Algal blooms ( Figure 44.24 ) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water . As a result , the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive . When the algae die and decompose , severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs .

40,"Like terrestrial biomes , aquatic biomes are influenced by a series of abiotic factors . The aquatic medium — water — has different physical and chemical properties than air , however . Even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear ( there are no suspended particles ) , water , on its own , absorbs light . As one descends into a deep body of water , there will eventually be a depth which the sunlight cannot reach . While there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might obscure light ( like fog , dust , or insect swarms ) , usually these are not permanent features of the environment . The importance of light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems . In freshwater systems , stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and is related to the energy aspects of light .

The water at the bottom of the lake is then displaced by the heavier surface water and , thus , rises to the top . As that water rises to the top , the sediments and nutrients from the lake bottom are brought along with it . During the summer months , the lake water stratifies , or forms layers , with the warmest water at the lake surface .

40,"Human activity releases carbon dioxide and methane , two of the most important greenhouse gases , into the atmosphere in several ways . The primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels , such as gasoline , coal , and natural gas ( Figure 44.28 ) . Deforestation , cement manufacture , animal agriculture , the clearing of land , and the burning of forests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide . Methane ( CH 4 ) is produced when bacteria break down organic matter under anaerobic conditions . Anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater ( such as in rice paddies ) or in the intestines of herbivores . Methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition that occurs in landfills . Another source of methane is the melting of clathrates . Clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean . When water warms , these chunks of ice melt and methane is released . As the ocean ’ s water temperature increases , the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing , releasing even more methane .

40,"Greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate . When heat energy from the sun strikes the Earth , gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere , as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping . The greenhouse gases that affect Earth include carbon dioxide , methane , water vapor , nitrous oxide , and ozone . Approximately half of the radiation from the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the Earth . This radiation is converted into thermal radiation on the Earth ’ s surface , and then a portion of that energy is re-radiated back into the atmosphere . Greenhouse gases , however , reflect much of the thermal energy back to the Earth ’ s surface . The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere , the more thermal energy is reflected back to the Earth ’ s surface . Greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect : the warming of Earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . Evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature : as carbon dioxide rises , global temperature rises . Since 1950 , the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006 . In 2011 , the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was 392 ppm .

Bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation . Percolation is the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks . The water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygen depleted because the oxygen that is used during the decomposition of organic matter is not replaced . As the oxygen in the water is depleted , decomposition slows . This leads to organic acids and other acids building up and lowering the pH of the water . At a lower pH , nitrogen becomes unavailable to plants . This creates a challenge for plants because nitrogen is an important limiting resource .

Perhaps you are interested in learning about the natural world and how living things have adapted to the physical conditions of their environment . Or , perhaps you ’ re a future physician seeking to understand the connection between human health and ecology . Humans are a part of the ecological landscape , and human health is one important part of human interaction with our physical and living environment . Lyme disease , for instance , serves as one modern-day example of the connection between our health and the natural world ( Figure 44.1 ) . More formally known as Lyme borreliosis , Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) , which is the primary vector for this disease . However , not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans , and I . scapularis can have other hosts besides deer . In fact , it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host upon which the tick develops : a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer . Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be reduced .",0.8482323884963989,0.0

40,"Biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution . Abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation . As these abiotic factors change , the composition of plant and animal communities also changes . For example , if you were to begin a journey at the equator and walk north , you would notice gradual changes in plant communities . At the beginning of your journey , you would see tropical wet forests with broad-leaved evergreen trees , which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equator . As you continued to travel north , you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry forests with scattered trees . You would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture . At about 30 degrees north , these forests would give way to deserts , which are characterized by low precipitation . Moving farther north , you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies . Eventually , grasslands are replaced by deciduous temperate forests . These deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests found in the subarctic , the area south of the Arctic Circle . Finally , you would reach the Arctic tundra , which is found at the most northern latitudes . This trek north reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated with ecosystems found at different latitudes . However , different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic factors such as jet streams , the Gulf Stream , and ocean currents . If you were to hike up a mountain , the changes you would see in the vegetation would parallel those as you move to higher latitudes .",0.994199275970459,0.0

40,"Beneath the pelagic zone is the benthic realm , the deepwater region beyond the continental shelf ( Figure 44.21 ) . The bottom of the benthic realm is comprised of sand , silt , and dead organisms . Temperature decreases , remaining above freezing , as water depth increases . This is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the upper layers of the ocean . Because of this high level of nutrients , a diversity of fungi , sponges , sea anemones , marine worms , sea stars , fishes , and bacteria exist .",0.9956703782081604,0.0
40,"As the river or stream flows away from the source , the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows . This slow-moving water , caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite , has more sedimentation . Phytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water . Therefore , the water will not be as clear as it is near the source . The water is also warmer . Worms ( phylum Annelida ) and insects ( phylum Arthropoda ) can be found burrowing into the mud . The higher order predator vertebrates ( phylum Chordata ) include waterfowl , frogs , and fishes . These predators must find food in these slow moving , sometimes murky , waters and , unlike the trout in the waters at the source , these vertebrates may not be able to use vision as their primary sense to find food . Instead , they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey .",0.8669493198394775,0.0

40,"Antarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence . These ice cores are samples of polar ice obtained by means of drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers . Viewing the ice cores is like traveling backwards through time ; the deeper the sample , the earlier the time period . Trapped within the ice are bubbles of air and other biological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data . Antarctic ice cores have been collected and analyzed to indirectly estimate the temperature of the Earth over the past 400,000 years ( Figure 44.26 a ) . The 0 ° C on this graph refers to the long-term average . Temperatures that are greater than 0 ° C exceed Earth ’ s long-term average temperature . Conversely , temperatures that are less than 0 ° C are less than Earth ’ s average temperature . This figure shows that there have been periodic cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature . Before the late 1800s , the Earth has been as much as 9 ° C cooler and about 3 ° C warmer . Note that the graph in Figure 44.26 b shows that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has also risen and fallen in periodic cycles ; note the relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature . Figure 44.26 b shows that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have historically cycled between 180 and 300 parts per million ( ppm ) by volume . Figure 44.26 a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of Earth ’ s temperature during the last 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past . Two significant temperature anomalies , or irregularities , have occurred in the last 2000 years . These are the Medieval Climate Anomaly ( or the Medieval Warm Period ) and the Little Ice Age . A third temperature anomaly aligns with the Industrial Era . The Medieval Climate Anomaly occurred between 900 and 1300 AD . During this time period , many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather conditions prevailed in many parts of the world ; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10 ° C and 0.20 ° C above the norm . Although 0.10 ° C does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change , it did free seas of ice . Because of this warming , the Vikings were able to colonize Greenland . The Little Ice Age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 AD and 1850 AD . During this time , a slight cooling of a little less than 1 ° C was observed in North America , Europe , and possibly other areas of the Earth . This 1 ° C change in global temperature is a seemingly small deviation in temperature ( as was observed during the Medieval Climate Anomaly ); however , it also resulted in noticeable changes . Historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost . The Industrial Revolution , which began around 1750 , was characterized by changes in much of human society . Advances in agriculture increased the food supply , which improved the standard of living for people in Europe and the United States . New technologies were invented and provided jobs and cheaper goods . These new technologies were powered using fossil fuels , especially coal . The Industrial Revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the Industrial Era . When a fossil fuel is burned , carbon dioxide is released . With the beginning of the Industrial Era , atmospheric carbon dioxide began to rise ( Figure 44.27 ) .",0.992644190788269,0.0
40,"Annual precipitation ranges from 25 cm to 75 cm ( 9.8 – 29.5 in ) . Because of relatively lower annual precipitation in temperate grasslands , there are few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams . The dominant vegetation tends to consist of grasses and some prairies sustain populations of grazing animals Figure 44.17 . The vegetation is very dense and the soils are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes ( underground stems ) of these grasses . The roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic material ( humus ) in the soil when they die and decay .",0.23562438786029816,0.0
40,"Annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment . Environments with the greatest amount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis , plant growth , and the resulting net primary productivity are optimized . The climate of these areas is warm and wet . Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate , enzymes can work most efficiently , and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration ; together , these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) moving into the plant , resulting in high biomass production . The aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things , including habitat and food . Conversely , dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass . The animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in available food . 44.3 Terrestrial Biomes Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.27625998854637146,0.0

40,"A population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time . ( Organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics . ) A population is identified , in part , by where it lives , and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries : natural boundaries might be rivers , mountains , or deserts , while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass , manmade structures , or roads . The study of population ecology focuses on the number of individuals in an area and how and why population size changes over time . Population ecologists are particularly interested in counting the Karner blue butterfly , for example , because it is classified as federally endangered . However , the distribution and density of this species is highly influenced by the distribution and abundance of wild lupine . Researchers might ask questions about the factors leading to the decline of wild lupine and how these affect Karner blue butterflies . For example , ecologists know that wild lupine thrives in open areas where trees and shrubs are largely absent . In natural settings , intermittent wildfires regularly remove trees and shrubs , helping to maintain the open areas that wild lupine requires . Mathematical models can be used to understand how wildfire suppression by humans has led to the decline of this important plant for the Karner blue butterfly .",1.007733702659607,0.0
40,"A number of global events have occurred that may be attributed to climate change during our lifetimes . Glacier National Park in Montana is undergoing the retreat of many of its glaciers , a phenomenon known as glacier recession . In 1850 , the area contained approximately 150 glaciers . By 2010 , however , the park contained only about 24 glaciers greater than 25 acres in size . One of these glaciers is the Grinnell Glacier ( Figure 44.29 ) at Mount Gould . Between 1966 and 2005 , the size of Grinnell Glacier shrank by 40 percent . Similarly , the mass of the ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic is decreasing : Greenland lost 150 – 250 km 3 of ice per year between 2002 and 2006 . In addition , the size and thickness of the Arctic sea ice is decreasing .",0.9591038823127747,0.0

40,"A career in ecology contributes to many facets of human society . Understanding ecological issues can help society meet the basic human needs of food , shelter , and health care . Ecologists can conduct their research in the laboratory and outside in natural environments ( Figure 44.5 ) .

Ecologists manage natural resources such as white-tailed deer populations ( Odocoileus virginianus ) for hunting or aspen ( Populus spp . ) timber stands for paper production . Ecologists also work as educators who teach children and adults at various institutions including universities , high schools , museums , and nature centers . Ecologists may also work in advisory positions assisting local , state , and federal policymakers to develop laws that are ecologically sound , or they may develop those policies and legislation themselves . To become an ecologist requires an undergraduate degree , usually in a natural science . The undergraduate degree is often followed by specialized training or an advanced degree , depending on the area of ecology selected .

42,"Inflammation of the gums that can lead to irritation and bleeding is called gingivitis . When plaque accumulates on the teeth , bacteria colonize the gingival space . As this space becomes increasingly blocked , the environment becomes anaerobic . This allows a wide variety of microbes to colonize , including Porphyromonas , Streptococcus , and Actinomyces . The bacterial products , which include lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , proteases , lipoteichoic acids , and others , cause inflammation and gum damage ( Figure 24.9 ) . It is possible that methanogenic archaeans ( including Methanobrevibacter oralis and other Methanobrevibacter species ) also contribute to disease progression as some species have been identified in patients with periodontal disease , but this has proven difficult to study . 1 2 3 Gingivitis is diagnosed by visual inspection , including measuring pockets in the gums , and X-rays , and is usually treated using good dental hygiene and professional dental cleaning , with antibiotics reserved for severe cases . 1 Hans-Peter Horz and Georg Conrads . “ Methanogenic Archaea and Oral Infections — Ways to Unravel the Black Box . ” Journal of Oral Microbiology 3 ( 2011 ) . doi : 10.3402 / jom . v3i0 . 5940 . 2 Hiroshi Maeda , Kimito Hirai , Junji Mineshiba , Tadashi Yamamoto , Susumu Kokeguchi , and Shogo Takashiba . “ Medical Microbiological Approach to Archaea in Oral Infectious Diseases . ” Japanese Dental Science Review 49 : 2 , p . 72 – 78 . 3 Paul W .

Damaged skin , as occurs with eczema or psoriasis , can also allow transmission . Avoiding contact with body fluids , especially blood , by wearing gloves and face protection and using disposable syringes and needles reduce the risk of infection . Washing exposed skin with soap and water is recommended . Antiseptics may also be used , but may not help . Post-exposure treatment , including treatment with hepatitis B immunoglobulin ( HBIG ) and vaccination , may be used in the event of exposure to the virus from an infected patient .

There are four genotypes that differ somewhat in their mode of transmission , distribution , and other factors ( for example , two are zoonotic and two are not , and only one causes chronic infection ) . Genotypes three and four are only transmitted through food , while genotypes one and two are also transmitted through water and fecal-oral routes . Genotype one is the only type transmitted person-to-person and is the most common cause of HEV outbreaks . Consumption of undercooked meat , especially deer or pork , and shellfish can lead to infection .

These bacteria produce urease , which stimulates an immune response and creates ammonia that neutralizes stomach acids to provide a more hospitable microenvironment . The infection damages the cells of the stomach lining , including those that normally produce the protective mucus that serves as a barrier between the tissue and stomach acid . As a result , inflammation ( gastritis ) occurs and ulcers may slowly develop . Ulcer formation can also be caused by toxin activity . It has been reported that 50 % of clinical isolates of H . pylori have detectable levels of exotoxin activity in vitro . 9 This toxin , VacA , induces vacuole formation in host cells .

The causes of gastrointestinal illness can vary widely , but such diseases can be grouped into two categories : those caused by infection ( the growth of a pathogen in the GI tract ) or intoxication ( the presence of a microbial toxin in the GI tract ) . Foodborne pathogens like Escherichia coli O157 : H7 are among the most common sources of gastrointestinal disease . Contaminated food and water have always posed a health risk for humans , but in today ’ s global economy , outbreaks can occur on a much larger scale . E . coli O157 : H7 is a potentially deadly strain of E . coli with a history of contaminating meat and produce that are not properly processed . The source of an E . coli O157 : H7 outbreak can be difficult to trace , especially if the contaminated food is processed in a foreign country .

42,"Because V . cholerae is killed by stomach acid , relatively large doses are needed for a few microbial cells to survive to reach the intestines and cause infection . The motile cells travel through the mucous layer of the intestines , where they attach to epithelial cells and release cholera enterotoxin . The toxin is an A-B toxin with activity through adenylate cyclase ( see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens ) . Within the intestinal cell , cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels increase , which activates a chloride channel and results in the release of ions into the intestinal lumen . This increase in osmotic pressure in the lumen leads to water also entering the lumen . As the water and electrolytes leave the body , it causes rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance .

42,"As food leaves the oral cavity , it travels through the pharynx , or the back of the throat , and moves into the esophagus , which carries the food from the pharynx to the stomach without adding any additional digestive enzymes . The stomach produces mucus to protect its lining , as well as digestive enzymes and acid to break down food . Partially digested food then leaves the stomach through the pyloric sphincter , reaching the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum . Pancreatic juice , which includes enzymes and bicarbonate ions , is released into the small intestine to neutralize the acidic material from the stomach and to assist in digestion . Bile , produced by the liver but stored in the gallbladder , is also released into the small intestine to emulsify fats so that they can travel in the watery environment of the small intestine . Digestion continues in the small intestine , where the majority of nutrients contained in the food are absorbed . Simple columnar epithelial cells called enterocytes line the lumen surface of the small intestinal folds called villi . Each enterocyte has smaller microvilli ( cytoplasmic membrane extensions ) on the cellular apical surface that increase the surface area to allow more absorption of nutrients to occur ( Figure 24.5 ) .",0.9334718585014343,0.0

The reflections of early explorers who conducted scientific treks throughout the West tended to confirm this belief . Major Stephen Harriman Long , who commanded an expedition through Missouri and into the Yellowstone region in 1819 – 1820 , frequently described the Great Plains as a arid and useless region , suitable as nothing more than a “ great American desert . ” But , beginning in the 1840s , a combination of economic opportunity and ideological encouragement changed the way Americans thought of the West . The federal government offered a number of incentives , making it viable for Americans to take on the challenge of seizing these rough lands from others and subsequently taming them . Still , most Americans who went west needed some financial security at the outset of their journey ; even with government aid , the truly poor could not make the trip . The cost of moving an entire family westward , combined with the risks as well as the questionable chances of success , made the move prohibitive for most . While the economic Panic of 1837 led many to question the promise of urban America , and thus turn their focus to the promise of commercial farming in the West , the Panic also resulted in many lacking the financial resources to make such a commitment .

The militia prepared to round up the Sioux . The tribe , after the death of Sitting Bull , who had been arrested , shot , and killed in 1890 , prepared to surrender at Wounded Knee , South Dakota , on December 29 , 1890 .

However , those who did settle the area were proud of their heritage and ability to develop rancheros of great size and success . Despite promises made in the treaty , these Californios — as they came to be known — quickly lost their land to White settlers who simply displaced the rightful landowners , by force if necessary .

43,"The Pacific Railway Act was pivotal in helping settlers move west more quickly , as well as move their farm products , and later cattle and mining deposits , back east . The first of many railway initiatives , this act commissioned the Union Pacific Railroad to build new track west from Omaha , Nebraska , while the Central Pacific Railroad moved east from Sacramento , California . The law provided each company with ownership of all public lands within two hundred feet on either side of the track laid , as well as additional land grants and payment through load bonds , prorated on the difficulty of the terrain it crossed . Because of these provisions , both companies made a significant profit , whether they were crossing hundreds of miles of open plains , or working their way through the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California . As a result , the nation ’ s first transcontinental railroad was completed when the two companies connected their tracks at Promontory , Utah , in the spring of 1869 . Other tracks , including lines radiating from this original one , subsequently created a network that linked all corners of the nation ( Figure 17.4 ) . In addition to legislation designed to facilitate western settlement , the U . S . government assumed an active role on the ground , building numerous forts throughout the West to protect and assist settlers during their migration . Forts such as Fort Laramie in Wyoming ( built in 1834 ) and Fort Apache in Arizona ( 1870 ) served as protection from nearby Native Americans as well as maintained peace between potential warring tribes . Others located throughout Colorado and Wyoming became important trading posts for miners and fur trappers . Those built in Kansas , Nebraska , and the Dakotas served primarily to provide relief for farmers during times of drought or related hardships . Forts constructed along the California coastline provided protection in the wake of the Mexican-American War as well as during the American Civil War . These locations subsequently serviced the U . S . Navy and provided important support for growing Pacific trade routes . Whether as army posts constructed for the protection of White settlers and to maintain peace among Native tribes , or as trading posts to further facilitate the development of the region , such forts proved to be vital contributions to westward migration .",1.0116859674453735,0.0

In a haphazard fashion , they sought to provide services ranging from social aid to education , places of worship , health facilities , and more to their fellow Chinese immigrants . But only American Indians suffered greater discrimination and racial violence , legally sanctioned by the federal government , than did Chinese immigrants at this juncture in American history . As Chinese workers began competing with White Americans for jobs in California cities , the latter began a system of built-in discrimination . In the 1870s , White Americans formed “ anti-coolie clubs ” ( “ coolie ” being a racial slur directed towards people of any Asian descent ) , through which they organized boycotts of Chinese-produced products and lobbied for anti-Chinese laws . Some protests turned violent , as in 1885 in Rock Springs , Wyoming , where tensions between White and Chinese immigrant miners erupted in a riot , resulting in over two dozen Chinese immigrants being murdered and many more injured .",0.9000227451324463,0.0

They travelled along several identifiable trails : first the Oregon Trail , then later the Santa Fe and California Trails , among others . The Oregon Trail is the most famous of these western routes . Two thousand miles long and barely passable on foot in the early nineteenth century , by the 1840s , wagon trains were a common sight .

The famous Chisholm Trail provided a quick path from Texas to railroad terminals in Abilene , Wichita , and Dodge City , Kansas , where cowboys would receive their pay . These “ cowtowns , ” as they became known , quickly grew to accommodate the needs of cowboys and the cattle industry . Cattlemen like Joseph G . McCoy , born in Illinois , quickly realized that the railroad offered a perfect way to get highly sought beef from Texas to the East . McCoy chose Abilene as a locale that would offer cowboys a convenient place to drive the cattle , and went about building stockyards , hotels , banks , and more to support the business . He promoted his services and encouraged cowboys to bring their cattle through Abilene for good money ; soon , the city had grown into a bustling western city , complete with ways for the cowboys to spend their hard-earned pay ( Figure 17.10 ) .",0.9037360548973083,0.0

The ban was later extended on multiple occasions until its repeal in 1943 . Eventually , some Chinese immigrants returned to China . Those who remained were stuck in the lowest-paying , most menial jobs .

Is it likely that the Chinese laborers , many of whom died due to the harsh conditions , considered themselves part of “ a great army ” ? Certainly , this account reveals the unwitting racism of the day , where workers were grouped together by their ethnicity , and each ethnic group was labeled monolithically as “ good workers ” or “ troublesome , ” with no regard for individual differences among the hundreds of Chinese or Irish workers .",0.02659117802977562,0.0

These pioneers , like the Ingalls family of Little House on the Prairie book and television fame ( see inset below ) , were seeking land and opportunity . Popularly known as “ sodbusters , ” these men and women in the Midwest faced a difficult life on the frontier . They settled throughout the land that now makes up the Midwestern states of Wisconsin , Minnesota , Kansas , Nebraska , and the Dakotas . The weather and environment were bleak , and settlers struggled to eke out a living . A few unseasonably rainy years had led would-be settlers to believe that the “ great desert ” was no more , but the region ’ s typically low rainfall and harsh temperatures made crop cultivation hard . Irrigation was a requirement , but finding water and building adequate systems proved too difficult and expensive for many farmers . It was not until 1902 and the passage of the Newlands Reclamation Act that a system finally existed to set aside funds from the sale of public lands to build dams for subsequent irrigation efforts . Prior to that , farmers across the Great Plains relied primarily on dry-farming techniques to grow corn , wheat , and sorghum , a practice that many continued in later years .

The vast majority were men , although families also migrated , despite incredible hardships for women with young children . More recent immigrants also migrated west , with the largest numbers coming from Northern Europe and Canada . Germans , Scandinavians , and Irish were among the most common . These ethnic groups tended to settle close together , creating strong rural communities that mirrored the way of life they had left behind . According to U . S . Census Bureau records , the number of Scandinavians living in the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century exploded , from barely 18,000 in 1850 to over 1.1 million in 1900 . During that same time period , the German-born population in the United States grew from 584,000 to nearly 2.7 million and the Irish-born population grew from 961,000 to 1.6 million . As they moved westward , several thousand immigrants established homesteads in the Midwest , primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin , where , as of 1900 , over one-third of the population was foreign-born , and in North Dakota , whose immigrant population stood at 45 percent at the turn of the century .

43,"In a few instances , frustrated Hispanic citizens fought back against the White settlers who dispossessed them of their belongings . In 1889 – 1890 in New Mexico , several hundred Mexican Americans formed las Gorras Blancas ( the White Caps ) to try and reclaim their land and intimidate White Americans , preventing further land seizures . White Caps conducted raids of White farms , burning homes , barns , and crops to express their growing anger and frustration . However , their actions never resulted in any fundamental changes . Several White Caps were captured , beaten , and imprisoned , whereas others eventually gave up , fearing harsh reprisals against their families . Some White Caps adopted a more political strategy , gaining election to local offices throughout New Mexico in the early 1890s , but growing concerns over the potential impact upon the territory ’ s quest for statehood led several citizens to heighten their repression of the movement . Other laws passed in the United States intended to deprive Mexican Americans of their heritage as much as their lands . “ Sunday Laws ” prohibited “ noisy amusements ” such as bullfights , cockfights , and other cultural gatherings common to Hispanic communities at the time . “ Greaser Laws ” permitted the imprisonment of any unemployed Mexican American on charges of vagrancy . Although Hispanic Americans held tightly to their cultural heritage as their remaining form of self-identity , such laws did take a toll . In California and throughout the Southwest , the massive influx of Anglo-American settlers simply overran the Hispanic populations that had been living and thriving there , sometimes for generations . Despite being U . S . citizens with full rights , Hispanics quickly found themselves outnumbered , outvoted , and , ultimately , outcast . Corrupt state and local governments favored Whites in land disputes , and mining companies and cattle barons discriminated against them , as with the Chinese workers , in terms of pay and working conditions . In growing urban areas such as Los Angeles , barrios , or clusters of working-class homes , grew more isolated from the White American centers .

43,"In 1862 , frustrated and angered by the lack of annuity payments and the continuous encroachment on their reservation lands , Dakota Sioux in Minnesota rebelled in what became known as the Dakota War or the War of 1862 , killing the White settlers who moved onto their tribal lands . Over one thousand White settlers were captured or killed in the attack , before an armed militia regained control . Of the four hundred Sioux captured by U . S . troops , 303 were sentenced to death , but President Lincoln intervened , releasing all but thirty-eight of the men . The thirty-eight who were found guilty were hanged in the largest mass execution in the country ’ s history , and the rest of the tribe was banished . Settlers in other regions responded to news of this raid with fear and aggression . In Colorado , Arapahoe and Cheyenne tribes fought back against land encroachment ; White militias then formed , decimating even some of the tribes that were willing to cooperate . One of the more vicious examples was near Sand Creek , Colorado , where Colonel John Chivington led a militia raid upon a camp in which the leader had already negotiated a peaceful settlement . The camp was flying both the American flag and the white flag of surrender when Chivington ’ s troops murdered close to one hundred people , the majority of them women and children , in what became known as the Sand Creek Massacre . For the rest of his life , Chivington would proudly display his collection of nearly one hundred Native American scalps from that day . Subsequent investigations by the U . S .

While land was essentially free under the Homestead Act , all other farm necessities cost money and were initially difficult to obtain in the newly settled parts of the country where market economies did not yet fully reach . Horses , livestock , wagons , wells , fencing , seed , and fertilizer were all critical to survival , but often hard to come by as the population initially remained sparsely settled across vast tracts of land . Railroads charged notoriously high rates for farm equipment and livestock , making it difficult to procure goods or make a profit on anything sent back east . Banks also charged high interest rates , and , in a cycle that replayed itself year after year , farmers would borrow from the bank with the intention of repaying their debt after the harvest . As the number of farmers moving westward increased , the market price of their produce steadily declined , even as the value of the actual land increased .

43,"Eventually , the arrival of a more extensive railroad network aided farmers , mostly by bringing much-needed supplies such as lumber for construction and new farm machinery . While John Deere sold a steel-faced plow as early as 1838 , it was James Oliver ’ s improvements to the device in the late 1860s that transformed life for homesteaders . His new , less expensive “ chilled plow ” was better equipped to cut through the shallow grass roots of the Midwestern terrain , as well as withstand damage from rocks just below the surface . Similar advancements in hay mowers , manure spreaders , and threshing machines greatly improved farm production for those who could afford them . Where capital expense became a significant factor , larger commercial farms — known as “ bonanza farms ” — began to develop . Farmers in Minnesota , North Dakota , and South Dakota hired migrant farmers to grow wheat on farms in excess of twenty thousand acres each . These large farms were succeeding by the end of the century , but small family farms continued to suffer . Although the land was nearly free , it cost close to $ 1000 for the necessary supplies to start up a farm , and many would-be landowners lured westward by the promise of cheap land became migrant farmers instead , working other peoples ’ land for a wage .

As more Americans moved to the region to seek permanent settlement , as opposed to brief speculative ventures , they also sought the safety and support that government order could bring .

43,"Despite this grim image , the challenges of farm life eventually empowered women to break through some legal and social barriers . Many lived more equitably as partners with their husbands than did their eastern counterparts , helping each other through both hard times and good . If widowed , a wife typically took over responsibility for the farm , a level of management that was very rare back east , where the farm would fall to a son or other male relation . Pioneer women made important decisions and were considered by their husbands to be more equal partners in the success of the homestead , due to the necessity that all members had to work hard and contribute to the farming enterprise for it to succeed . Therefore , it is not surprising that the first states to grant women ’ s rights , including the right to vote , were those in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest , where women pioneers worked the land side by side with men . Some women seemed to be well suited to the challenges that frontier life presented them . Writing to her Aunt Martha from their homestead in Minnesota in 1873 , Mary Carpenter refused to complain about the hardships of farm life : “ I try to trust in God ’ s promises , but we can ’ t expect him to work miracles nowadays .

The lowest-hanging fruit had been picked , and now it required investment capital and machinery to dig mine shafts that could reach remaining ore . With a much larger investment , miners needed a larger strike to be successful . This shift led to larger businesses underwriting mining operations , which eventually led to the development of greater urban stability and infrastructure .

43,"Beginning in the 1880s , clergymen , government officials , and social workers all worked to assimilate Native peoples into American life . The government permitted reformers to remove Native American children from their homes and place them in boarding schools , such as the Carlisle Indian School or the Hampton Institute , where they were taught to abandon their tribal traditions and embrace the tools of American productivity , modesty , and sanctity through total immersion . Such schools not only acculturated Native American boys and girls , but also provided vocational training for males and domestic science classes for females . Adults were also targeted by religious reformers , specifically evangelical Protestants as well as a number of Catholics , who sought to convince Native people to abandon their language , clothing , and social customs for a more Euro-American lifestyle ( Figure 17.14 ) .",0.9313805103302002,1.0
43,"Back east , the popular vision of the West was of a vast and empty land . But of course this was an exaggerated depiction . On the eve of westward expansion , as many as 250,000 Native Americans , representing a variety of tribes , populated the Great Plains . Previous wars against these tribes in the early nineteenth century , as well as the failure of earlier treaties , had led to a general policy of the forcible removal of many tribes in the eastern United States . The Indian Removal Act of 1830 resulted in the infamous “ Trail of Tears , ” which saw nearly fifty thousand Seminole , Choctaw , Chickasaw , and Creek people relocated west of the Mississippi River to what is now Oklahoma between 1831 and 1838 . Building upon such a history , the U . S . government was prepared , during the era of western settlement , to deal with tribes that settlers viewed as obstacles to expansion .",0.5714036822319031,1.0
43,"As wealthy men brought their families west , the lawless landscape began to change slowly . Abilene , Kansas , is one example of a lawless town , replete with prostitutes , gambling , and other vices , transformed when middle-class women arrived in the 1880s with their cattle baron husbands . These women began to organize churches , school , civic clubs , and other community programs to promote family values . They fought to remove opportunities for prostitution and all the other vices that they felt threatened the values that they held dear . Protestant missionaries eventually joined the women in their efforts , and , while they were not widely successful , they did bring greater attention to the problems . As a response , the U . S . Congress passed both the Comstock Law ( named after its chief proponent , anti-obscenity crusader Anthony Comstock ) in 1873 to ban the spread of “ lewd and lascivious literature ” through the mail and the subsequent Page Act of 1875 to prohibit the transportation of women into the United States for employment as prostitutes . However , the “ houses of ill repute ” continued to operate and remained popular throughout the West despite the efforts of reformers . 17.4 The Loss of American Indian Life and Culture Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9705001711845398,0.0
43,"As settlers sought more land for farming , mining , and cattle ranching , the first strategy employed to deal with the perceived "" Indian threat "" was to negotiate settlements to move tribes out of the path of White settlers . In 1851 , the chiefs of most of the Great Plains tribes agreed to the First Treaty of Fort Laramie . This agreement established distinct tribal borders , essentially codifying the reservation system . In return for annual payments of $ 50,000 to the tribes ( originally guaranteed for fifty years , but later revised to last for only ten ) as well as the hollow promise of noninterference from westward settlers , Native Americans agreed to stay clear of the path of settlement . Due to government corruption , many annuity payments never reached the tribes , and some reservations were left destitute and near starving . In addition , within a decade , as the pace and number of western settlers increased , even designated reservations became prime locations for farms and mining . Rather than negotiating new treaties , settlers — oftentimes backed by local or state militia units — simply attacked the tribes out of fear or to force them from the land . Some Indians resisted , only to then face massacres .",0.993057906627655,0.0
43,"As settlers and homesteaders moved westward to improve the land given to them through the Homestead Act , they faced a difficult and often insurmountable challenge . The land was difficult to farm , there were few building materials , and harsh weather , insects , and inexperience led to frequent setbacks . The prohibitive prices charged by the first railroad lines made it expensive to ship crops to market or have goods sent out . Although many farms failed , some survived and grew into large “ bonanza ” farms that hired additional labor and were able to benefit enough from economies of scale to grow profitable . Still , small family farms , and the settlers who worked them , were hard-pressed to do more than scrape out a living in an unforgiving environment that comprised arid land , violent weather shifts , and other challenges ( Figure 17.6 ) .",0.3032015860080719,0.0
43,"As White Americans pushed west , they not only collided with Native American tribes but also with Hispanic Americans and Chinese immigrants . Hispanics in the Southwest had the opportunity to become American citizens at the end of the Mexican-American war , but their status was markedly second-class . Chinese immigrants arrived en masse during the California Gold Rush and numbered in the hundreds of thousands by the late 1800s , with the majority living in California , working menial jobs . These distinct cultural and ethnic groups strove to maintain their rights and way of life in the face of persistent racism and entitlement . But the large number of White settlers and government-sanctioned land acquisitions left them at a profound disadvantage . Ultimately , both groups withdrew into homogenous communities in which their language and culture could survive .",0.0307577233761549,0.0

Although the threat of attacks was quite slim and nowhere proportionate to the number of U . S . Army actions directed against them , the occasional attack — often one of retaliation — was enough to fuel the popular fear of the “ savage ” Natives . The clashes , when they happened , were indeed brutal , although most of the brutality occurred at the hands of the settlers . Ultimately , the settlers , with the support of local militias and , later , with the federal government behind them , sought to eliminate the tribes from the lands they desired . The result was devastating for the Native tribes , which lacked the weapons and group cohesion to fight back against such well-armed forces .

43,"Americana Barbed Wire and a Way of Life Gone Called the “ devil ’ s rope ” by Native Americans , barbed wire had a profound impact on the American West . Before its invention , settlers and ranchers alike were stymied by a lack of building materials to fence off land . Communal grazing and long cattle drives were the norm . But with the invention of barbed wire , large cattle ranchers and their investors were able to cheaply and easily parcel off the land they wanted — whether or not it was legally theirs to contain . As with many other inventions , several people “ invented ” barbed wire around the same time . In 1873 , it was Joseph Glidden , however , who claimed the winning design and patented it . Not only did it spell the end of the free range for settlers and cowboys , it kept more land away from Native tribes , who had never envisioned a culture that would claim to own land ( Figure 17.11 ) .",0.8502651453018188,1.0
43,"Although the West was numerically a male-dominated society , homesteading in particular encouraged the presence of women , families , and a domestic lifestyle , even if such a life was not an easy one . Women faced all the physical hardships that men encountered in terms of weather , illness , and danger , with the added complication of childbirth . Often , there was no doctor or midwife providing assistance , and many women died from treatable complications , as did their newborns . While some women could find employment in the newly settled towns as teachers , cooks , or seamstresses , they originally did not enjoy many rights . They could not sell property , sue for divorce , serve on juries , or vote . And for the vast majority of women , their work was not in towns for money , but on the farm . As late as 1900 , a typical farm wife could expect to devote nine hours per day to chores such as cleaning , sewing , laundering , and preparing food . Two additional hours per day were spent cleaning the barn and chicken coop , milking the cows , caring for the chickens , and tending the family garden . One wife commented in 1879 , “ [ We are ] not much better than slaves . It is a weary , monotonous round of cooking and washing and mending and as a result the insane asylum is a third filled with wives of farmers . ”",0.814860463142395,0.0
43,"Although homestead farming was the primary goal of most western settlers in the latter half of the nineteenth century , a small minority sought to make their fortunes quickly through other means . Specifically , gold ( and , subsequently , silver and copper ) prospecting attracted thousands of miners looking to “ get rich quick ” before returning east . In addition , ranchers capitalized on newly available railroad lines to move longhorn steers that populated southern and western Texas . This meat was highly sought after in eastern markets , and the demand created not only wealthy ranchers but an era of cowboys and cattle drives that in many ways defines how we think of the West today . Although neither miners nor ranchers intended to remain permanently in the West , many individuals from both groups ultimately stayed and settled there , sometimes due to the success of their gamble , and other times due to their abject failure .",0.9936701655387878,0.0

43,"A vital part of the assimilation effort was land reform . During earlier negotiations , the government had respected that the Native tribes used their land communally . Most Native American belief structures did not allow for the concept of individual land ownership ; rather , land was available for all to use , and required responsibility from all to protect it . As a part of their plan to Americanize the tribes , reformers sought legislation to replace this concept with the popular Euro-American notion of real estate ownership and self-reliance . One such law was the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 , named after a reformer and senator from Massachusetts , which struck a deadly blow to the Native American way of life . In what was essentially a new version of the original Homestead Act , the Dawes Act permitted the federal government to divide the lands of any tribe and grant 160 acres of farmland or 320 acres of grazing land to each head of family , with lesser amounts to single persons and others . In a nod towards the paternal relationship with which Whites viewed Native Americans — similar to the justification of the previous treatment of enslaved African Americans — the Dawes Act permitted the federal government to hold an individual Native American ’ s newly acquired land in trust for twenty-five years . Only then would they obtain full title and be granted the citizenship rights that land ownership entailed . It would not be until 1924 that formal citizenship was granted to all Native Americans . Under the Dawes Act , Native Americans were given the most arid , useless land . Further , inefficiencies and corruption in the government meant that much of the land due to be allotted to Native Americans was simply deemed “ surplus ” and claimed by settlers . Once all allotments were determined , the remaining tribal lands — as much as eighty million acres — were sold to White American settlers . The final element of “ Americanization ” was the symbolic “ last arrow ” pageant , which often coincided with the formal redistribution of tribal lands under the Dawes Act . At these events , Native Americans were forced to assemble in their tribal garb , carrying a bow and arrow . They would then symbolically fire their “ last arrow ” into the air , enter a tent where they would strip away their traditional clothing , dress in a White farmer ’ s coveralls , and emerge to take a plow and an American flag to show that they had converted to a new way of life . It was a seismic shift for the Native Americans , and one that left them bereft of their culture and history . 17.5 The Impact of Expansion on Chinese Immigrants and Hispanic Citizens Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.9872803688049316,1.0

45,"Vibrating objects , such as vocal cords , create sound waves or pressure waves in the air . When these pressure waves reach the ear , the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus ( pressure wave ) into a nerve impulse ( electrical signal ) that the brain perceives as sound . The pressure waves strike the tympanum , causing it to vibrate . The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear . The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window , which is the outermost structure of the inner ear . The structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth , a bony , hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear . Here , the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea . The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid ( perilymph ) inside the cochlea .

45,"The vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system . It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system , but it excites them in different ways . There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear : the utricle , the saccule , and three semicircular canals . Together , they make up what ’ s known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in Figure 36.15 . The utricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line , such as gravity . The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle and 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer , with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin . Embedded in this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystals — like tiny rocks . When the head is tilted , the crystals continue to be pulled straight down by gravity , but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift , thereby bending the stereocilia . The bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons , and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted , allowing the maintenance of balance . It is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance .",0.9534053802490234,1.0
45,"The stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration ( gravity ) and angular acceleration and deceleration .

Angular acceleration and deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of the head .",1.0215779542922974,0.0
45,"The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) . It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair-like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them . The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row , numbering approximately 3,500 . The stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membrane ’ s lower surface . The outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows . They number approximately 12,000 , and they function to fine tune incoming sound waves . The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane . All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors , and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel ( refer to Figure 36.2 ) . As a result , the hair cell membrane is depolarized , and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve . Intensity ( volume ) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated . The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way . The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions , according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it . Likewise , the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a specific frequency of sound waves . Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies , but they require stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range . The difference in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent . Compare that to adjacent piano strings , which are about six percent different . Place theory , which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear , states that high frequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port ( the oval window ) . Lower frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane . The basic pitch-determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated . The place theory is the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception . Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear , it is thought that there must be some auditory “ sharpening ” mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution .",0.9959942102432251,1.0
45,"The rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal . Both rods and cones contain photopigments . In vertebrates , the main photopigment , rhodopsin , has two main parts Figure 36.19 ): an opsin , which is a membrane protein ( in the form of a cluster of α-helices that span the membrane ) , and retinal — a molecule that absorbs light . When light hits a photoreceptor , it causes a shape change in the retinal , altering its structure from a bent ( cis ) form of the molecule to its linear ( trans ) isomer . This isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin , starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing of Na + channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor . Thus , unlike most other sensory neurons ( which become depolarized by exposure to a stimulus ) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold ( Figure 36.20 ) .

45,"The photoreceptive cells of the eye , where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs , are located in the retina ( shown in Figure 36.17 ) on the inner surface of the back of the eye . But light does not impinge on the retina unaltered . It passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina ( Figure 36.17 b ) . The cornea , the front transparent layer of the eye , and the crystalline lens , a transparent convex structure behind the cornea , both refract ( bend ) light to focus the image on the retina . The iris , which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye , is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye .

In conditions of low light , the iris relaxes and the pupil enlarges .",0.7550857067108154,0.0

Other axons constitute the parvocellular ( small cell ) pathway , which carries information on color and fine detail . Some visual information projects directly back into the brain , while other information crosses to the opposite side of the brain . This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma ( Greek , for “ crossing ” ) found at the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes .",0.9829515218734741,0.0
45,"The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system . This takes place at the sensory receptor , and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential . How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ? In this example , a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor ( as shown in Figure 36.2 ) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure . Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron , changing its electrical potential . Recall that in the nervous system , a positive change of a neuron ’ s electrical potential ( also called the membrane potential ) , depolarizes the neuron . Receptor potentials are graded potentials : the magnitude of these graded ( receptor ) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus . If the magnitude of depolarization is sufficient ( that is , if membrane potential reaches a threshold ) , the neuron will fire an action potential . In most cases , the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction , although for some receptors , such as those in the visual system , this is not always the case .",1.000083088874817,1.0
45,"The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length , such that it is thicker , tauter , and narrower at the outside of the whorl ( where the cochlea is largest ) , and thinner , floppier , and broader toward the apex , or center , of the whorl ( where the cochlea is smallest ) . Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the sound wave conducted through the fluid in the cochlea . For these reasons , the fluid-filled cochlea detects different wave frequencies ( pitches ) at different regions of the membrane . When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane , it flexes back and forth in a wave-like fashion . Above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane .",0.43470922112464905,0.0
45,"The main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis . The lens is dynamic , focusing and re-focusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field . The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken , changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina . With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens , and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results . Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina . Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short . For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry . Myopia ( nearsightedness ) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina . In this case , images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear .",1.0002683401107788,1.0

45,"The intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor . Thus , an intense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials , and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production of action potentials . A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated . An intense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors , while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer receptors . Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS , and the brain will further process incoming signals .",0.9896863698959351,0.0

45,"The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision . The fovea has a high density of cones . When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light , the eyes orient so that the object ’ s image falls on the fovea . However , when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light , the object can be better viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina , rather than the cones at the center , that operate better in low light . In humans , cones far outnumber rods in the fovea .",0.9151065349578857,1.0
45,"The fluid-filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles . They are arranged in three spatial planes . The base of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells . The hairs project into a gelatinous cap called the cupula and monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation . They would be stimulated by driving your car around a corner , turning your head , or falling forward . One canal lies horizontally , while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to the horizontal axis , as illustrated in Figure 36.15 . When the brain processes input from all three canals together , it can detect angular acceleration or deceleration in three dimensions . When the head turns , the fluid in the canals shifts , thereby bending stereocilia and sending signals to the brain . Upon cessation accelerating or decelerating — or just moving — the movement of the fluid within the canals slows or stops . For example , imagine holding a glass of water . When moving forward , water may splash backwards onto the hand , and when motion has stopped , water may splash forward onto the fingers . While in motion , the water settles in the glass and does not splash . Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself , but to changes in velocity , so moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement , but suddenly accelerating or braking would stimulate the receptors .

45,"The first step in sensation is reception , which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli ( being bent or squished , for example ) , chemicals , or temperature . The receptor can then respond to the stimuli . The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus , be it far away or in contact with the body , is that receptor ’ s receptive field . Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses . For the sense of touch , a stimulus must come into contact with body . For the sense of hearing , a stimulus can be a moderate distance away ( some baleen whale sounds can propagate for many kilometers ) .

Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals — whether potential mates , predators , or prey — or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival . Similarly , the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods . While the value of a sense of smell is obvious , what is the value of a sense of taste ? Different tasting foods have different attributes , both helpful and harmful . For example , sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric , which could be necessary for survival in lean times .

45,"Sensory receptors are classified into five categories : mechanoreceptors , thermoreceptors , proprioceptors , pain receptors , and chemoreceptors . These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces . What is commonly referred to as “ touch ” involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor . Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated ( that is , surrounded by a capsule ) or unencapsulated ( a group that includes free nerve endings ) . A free nerve ending , as its name implies , is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron . Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin , and they extend into the middle of the epidermis . Free nerve endings are sensitive to painful stimuli , to hot and cold , and to light touch . They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive to abrupt changes in stimulation . There are three classes of mechanoreceptors : tactile , proprioceptors , and baroreceptors . Mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due to physical deformation of their plasma membranes . They contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or close in response to pressure , touch , stretching , and sound . ” There are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin : Merkel ’ s disks , Meissner ’ s corpuscles , Ruffini endings , and Pacinian corpuscle ; two are located toward the surface of the skin and two are located deeper . A fifth type of mechanoreceptor , Krause end bulbs , are found only in specialized regions . Merkel ’ s disks ( shown in Figure 36.5 ) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis , both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin , that is , the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers , the soles of the feet , and the lips of humans and other primates . Merkel ’ s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips . They are slow-adapting , encapsulated nerve endings , and they respond to light touch . Light touch , also known as discriminative touch , is a light pressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed . The receptive fields of Merkel ’ s disks are small with well-defined borders . That makes them finely sensitive to edges and they come into use in tasks such as typing on a keyboard .

45,"Senses provide information about the body and its environment . Humans have five special senses : olfaction ( smell ) , gustation ( taste ) , equilibrium ( balance and body position ) , vision , and hearing . Additionally , we possess general senses , also called somatosensation , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and vibration . Vestibular sensation , which is an organism ’ s sense of spatial orientation and balance , proprioception ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia ( limb movement ) are part of somatosensation . Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system . This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction . In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus . Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron , which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system . In the second type of sensory transduction , a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment : this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor . Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli , thus showing little receptor specificity . For example , pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature changes , chemical stimulation , or pressure .",1.0134433507919312,1.0

45,"Question : What is the smallest detectible weight difference between a one-pound bag of rice and a larger bag ? What is the smallest detectible difference between a 20 - pound bag and a larger bag ? In both cases , at what weights are the differences detected ? This smallest detectible difference in stimuli is known as the just-noticeable difference ( JND ) . Background : Research background literature on JND and on Weber ’ s Law , a description of a proposed mathematical relationship between the overall magnitude of the stimulus and the JND . You will be testing JND of different weights of rice in bags . Choose a convenient increment that is to be stepped through while testing . For example , you could choose 10 percent increments between one and two pounds ( 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.4 , and so on ) or 20 percent increments ( 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.6 , and 1.8 ) . Hypothesis : Develop a hypothesis about JND in terms of percentage of the whole weight being tested ( such as “ the JND between the two small bags and between the two large bags is proportionally the same , ” or “ . . . is not proportionally the same . ” ) So , for the first hypothesis , if the JND between the one-pound bag and a larger bag is 0.2 pounds ( that is , 20 percent ; 1.0 pound feels the same as 1.1 pounds , but 1.0 pound feels less than 1.2 pounds ) , then the JND between the 20 - pound bag and a larger bag will also be 20 percent . ( So , 20 pounds feels the same as 22 pounds or 23 pounds , but 20 pounds feels less than 24 pounds . ) Test the hypothesis : Enlist 24 participants , and split them into two groups of 12 . To set up the demonstration , assuming a 10 percent increment was selected , have the first group be the one-pound group . As a counter-balancing measure against a systematic error , however , six of the first group will compare one pound to two pounds , and step down in weight ( 1.0 to 2.0 , 1.0 to 1.9 , and so on . ) , while the other six will step up ( 1.0 to 1.1 , 1.0 to 1.2 , and so on ) . Apply the same principle to the 20 - pound group ( 20 to 40 , 20 to 38 , and so on , and 20 to 22 , 20 to 24 , and so on ) . Given the large difference between 20 and 40 pounds , you may wish to use 30 pounds as your larger weight . In any case , use two weights that are easily detectable as different . Record the observations : Record the data in a table similar to the table below . For the one-pound and 20 - pound groups ( base weights ) record a plus sign ( + ) for each participant that detects a difference between the base weight and the step weight .

45,"Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity . That is , they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light . In neurons that exhibit tonic activity , the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline ; while some stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline , and other stimuli decrease firing rate . In the absence of light , the bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones . Exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells . The now active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells , which send action potentials along their axons ( which leave the eye as the optic nerve ) . Thus , the visual system relies on change in retinal activity , rather than the absence or presence of activity , to encode visual signals for the brain . Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells . When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell , the horizontal cell inhibits more distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells , creating lateral inhibition . This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the images by making regions receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker . Amacrine cells can distribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells .",0.9364493489265442,0.0

Interior to the tympanum is the middle ear . The middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles , which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear .

There are also projections to the temporal cortex , which account for feelings of dizziness ; projections to autonomic nervous system areas in the brainstem , which account for motion sickness ; and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex , which monitors subjective measurements of the external world and self-movement .

45,"Detecting a taste ( gustation ) is fairly similar to detecting an odor ( olfaction ) , given that both taste and smell rely on chemical receptors being stimulated by certain molecules . The primary organ of taste is the taste bud . A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae ( singular : papilla ) ( illustrated in Figure 36.10 ) . There are several structurally distinct papillae . Filiform papillae , which are located across the tongue , are tactile , providing friction that helps the tongue move substances , and contain no taste cells . In contrast , fungiform papillae , which are located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue , each contain one to eight taste buds and also have receptors for pressure and temperature . The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a V near the posterior margin of the tongue . In addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae — leaf-like papillae located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue , as seen in the Figure 36.10 micrograph . Foliate papillae contain about 1,300 taste buds within their folds . Finally , there are circumvallate papillae , which are wall-like papillae in the shape of an inverted “ V ” at the back of the tongue . Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds . Each taste bud ’ s taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days . These are elongated cells with hair-like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore ( illustrate in Figure 36.11 ) . Food molecules ( tastants ) are dissolved in saliva , and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli . The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue , outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent .",1.0170023441314697,1.0

These are slow-adapting , encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch and deformations within joints , so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and movement . Thus , they also contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia . Ruffini endings also detect warmth . Note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors . It is not surprising , then , that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli . Pacinian corpuscles ( seen in Figure 36.7 ) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to Meissner ’ s corpuscles ; they are found in the bone periosteum , joint capsules , pancreas and other viscera , breast , and genitals . They are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient ( but not prolonged ) pressure and high-frequency vibration .

All bilaterally symmetric animals have a sensory system , and the development of any species ’ sensory system has been driven by natural selection ; thus , sensory systems differ among species according to the demands of their environments . The shark , unlike most fish predators , is electrosensitive — that is , sensitive to electrical fields produced by other animals in its environment . While it is helpful to this underwater predator , electrosensitivity is a sense not found in most land animals .",0.8776010870933533,0.0
45,"Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light . Wavelength ( which varies inversely with frequency ) manifests itself as hue . Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths ( and is lower frequency ) , while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths ( and is higher frequency ) . The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers ( nm ); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter . Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm . Some other animals , though , can detect wavelengths outside of the human range . For example , bees see near-ultraviolet light in order to locate nectar guides on flowers , and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light ( heat that prey gives off ) .",0.025351088494062424,0.0

45,"Both taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment . The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet , sour , bitter , salty and umami . The first four tastes need little explanation . The identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently — it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth , but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later . The taste of umami , also known as savoriness , is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate . In fact , monosodium glutamate , or MSG , is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods . What is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish umami ?

45,"Audition , or hearing , is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions . It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger , such as an approaching predator , and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating . On the other hand , although it is physically linked to the auditory system , the vestibular system is not involved in hearing . Instead , an animal ’ s vestibular system detects its own movement , both linear and angular acceleration and deceleration , and balance .",0.9887855052947998,0.0
45,"As with auditory stimuli , light travels in waves . The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium — a gas , a liquid , or a solid . In contrast , light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium ; light can travel in a vacuum ( Figure 36.16 ) . The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of light — a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon . A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum , which includes radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light .",0.9104153513908386,0.0
45,"As is true for all waves , there are four main characteristics of a sound wave : frequency , wavelength , period , and amplitude . Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time , and in sound is heard as pitch . High-frequency ( ≥ 15.000 Hz ) sounds are higher-pitched ( short wavelength ) than low-frequency ( long wavelengths ; ≤ 100Hz ) sounds . Frequency is measured in cycles per second , and for sound , the most commonly used unit is hertz ( Hz ) , or cycles per second . Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz . Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies , but everyone ’ s ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age . Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz ; cats , 60,000 Hz ; bats , 100,000 Hz ; and dolphins 150,000 Hz , and American shad ( Alosa sapidissima ) , a fish , can hear 180,000 Hz . Those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound . Amplitude , or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough , in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in Figure 36.12 . The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds . For sound , volume is measured in decibels ( dB ) . The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point . Humans speak normally at 60 decibels .",1.018121361732483,1.0

Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors . Compare that to mice , for example , which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types , and therefore probably sense more odors .

46,"The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum , consisting of about 200 million axons . The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side . Normally , we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day-to-day functions , but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well . In some cases of severe epilepsy , doctors elect to sever the corpus callosum as a means of controlling the spread of seizures ( Figure 3.16 ) .

These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) . People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin ; therefore , they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production , and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume .

Ovaries secrete estrogens and progesterone , and the testes secrete androgens , such as testosterone . Dig Deeper Athletes and Anabolic Steroids Although it is against Federal laws and many professional athletic associations ( The National Football League , for example ) have banned their use , anabolic steroid drugs continue to be used by amateur and professional athletes . The drugs are believed to enhance athletic performance . Anabolic steroid drugs mimic the effects of the body ’ s own steroid hormones , like testosterone and its derivatives . These drugs have the potential to provide a competitive edge by increasing muscle mass , strength , and endurance , although not all users may experience these results . Moreover , use of performance-enhancing drugs ( PEDs ) does not come without risks . Anabolic steroid use has been linked with a wide variety of potentially negative outcomes , ranging in severity from largely cosmetic ( acne ) to life threatening ( heart attack ) . Furthermore , use of these substances can result in profound changes in mood and can increase aggressive behavior ( National Institute on Drug Abuse , 2001 ) .

46,"Sickle-cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes . For example , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts . If someone with this condition goes untreated , he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function , seizures , and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders . Because PKU is a recessive trait , each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order to produce a child with the condition ( Figure 3.6 ) . So far , we have discussed traits that involve just one gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene . Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene . Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from ? Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes . A mutation is a sudden , permanent change in a gene . While many mutations can be harmful or lethal , once in a while , a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation . Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations . In order for this process to occur , there must be competition — more technically , there must be variability in genes ( and resultant traits ) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment . If a population consisted of identical individuals , then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way , and there would be no variation in selection . In contrast , diversity in genes and associated traits allows some individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change . This creates a distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and genetic transmission .",0.9955156445503235,1.0

46,"In healthy individuals , the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons , where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse ( Figure 3.9 ) . The synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs . Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron . Receptors , proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach , vary in shape , with different shapes “ matching ” different neurotransmitters .",0.06912832707166672,1.0
46,"In contrast to agonists and antagonists , which both operate by binding to receptor sites , reuptake inhibitors prevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron . This leaves more neurotransmitters in the synapse for a longer time , increasing its effects . Depression , which has been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels , is commonly treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) . By preventing reuptake , SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin , giving it more time to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites . Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac , Paxil , and Zoloft . The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin , and it affects the same neurons and receptors as serotonin . Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological disorders . Often , an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement , and many psychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects . Furthermore , individuals vary dramatically in how they respond to the drugs . To improve chances for success , it is not uncommon for people receiving pharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and / or behavioral therapies as well .

46,"Genetic variation , the genetic difference between individuals , is what contributes to a species ’ adaptation to its environment . In humans , genetic variation begins with an egg , about 100 million sperm , and fertilization . Fertile women ovulate roughly once per month , releasing an egg from follicles in the ovary . During the egg's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes . Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs . In each chromosome , sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics , known as traits , such as eye color , hair color , and so on . A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles . An allele is a specific version of a gene . So , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has . When a sperm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes . Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) . A person ’ s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual . Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’ s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( Figure 3.4 ) . Most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by one gene . A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent . In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b . ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele . When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele . When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous . For example , smooth chin is a recessive trait , which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele ( bb ) . Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin . What type of chin will their child have ? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries . If the woman is homozygous for cleft chin ( BB ) , her offspring will always have cleft chin . It gets a little more complicated , however , if the mother is heterozygous for this gene ( Bb ) . Since the father has a smooth chin — therefore homozygous for the recessive allele ( bb ) — we can expect the offspring to have a 50 % chance of having a cleft chin and a 50 % chance of having a smooth chin ( Figure 3.5 ) .",0.9924240112304688,1.0

46,"Genes do not exist in a vacuum . Although we are all biological organisms , we also exist in an environment that is incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves , but also in what combination . Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction . Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall . For example , if an individual ’ s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation . According to the concept of range of reaction , genes set definite limits on potential , and environment determines how much of that potential is achieved . Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person ’ s potential . Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic environmental correlation . Stated simply , our genes influence our environment , and our environment influences the expression of our genes ( Figure 3.7 ) . Not only do our genes and environment interact , as in range of reaction , but they also influence one another bidirectionally . For example , the child of an NBA player would probably be exposed to basketball from an early age . Such exposure might allow the child to realize his or her full genetic , athletic potential . Thus , the parents ’ genes , which the child shares , influence the child ’ s environment , and that environment , in turn , is well suited to support the child ’ s genetic potential . In another approach to gene-environment interactions , the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways . In other words , researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes . As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious . For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings ) . But even with identical genes , there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin ’ s life . Sometimes , one twin will develop a disease and the other will not . In one example , Tiffany , an identical twin , died from cancer at age 7 , but her twin , now 19 years old , has never had cancer . Although these individuals share an identical genotype , their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is expressed over time . The epigenetic perspective is very different from range of reaction , because here the genotype is not fixed and limited . Link to Learning",0.9474631547927856,1.0

46,"Beyond the damage to the frontal lobe itself , subsequent investigations into the rod's path also identified probable damage to pathways between the frontal lobe and other brain structures , including the limbic system . With connections between the planning functions of the frontal lobe and the emotional processes of the limbic system severed , Gage had difficulty controlling his emotional impulses . However , there is some evidence suggesting that the dramatic changes in Gage ’ s personality were exaggerated and embellished . Gage's case occurred in the midst of a 19 th century debate over localization — regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions . On the basis of extremely limited information about Gage , the extent of his injury , and his life before and after the accident , scientists tended to find support for their own views , on whichever side of the debate they fell ( Macmillan , 1999 ) . The brain ’ s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe , and is involved in processing information from the body ’ s senses . It contains the somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body , such as touch , temperature , and pain . The somatosensory cortex is organized topographically , which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex ( Figure 3.20 ) . For example , the portion of the cortex that processes sensory information from the hand is adjacent to the portion that processes information from the wrist .",0.11995802074670792,0.0
46,"Between signals , the neuron membrane ’ s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential . Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i . e . , a sodium-potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) . Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas , and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge . In the resting state , sodium ( Na + ) is at higher concentrations outside the cell , so it will tend to move into the cell . Potassium ( K + ) , on the other hand , is more concentrated inside the cell , and will tend to move out of the cell ( Figure 3.10 ) . In addition , the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside . This provides an additional force on sodium , causing it to move into the cell . From this resting potential state , the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly ( Figure 3.11 ) . When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites — due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding to its receptors — small pores , or gates , open on the neuronal membrane , allowing Na + ions , propelled by both charge and concentration differences , to move into the cell . With this influx of positive ions , the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive . If that charge reaches a certain level , called the threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . Many additional pores open , causing a massive influx of Na + ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential , the peak action potential . At the peak of the spike , the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open . As positively charged potassium ions leave , the cell quickly begins repolarization . At first , it hyperpolarizes , becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential , and then it levels off , returning to the resting potential . This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals . The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions . The action potential moves all the way down the axon to the terminal buttons .",0.8836096525192261,1.0

46,"Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet . In some axons , glial cells form a fatty substance known as the myelin sheath , which coats the axon and acts as an insulator , increasing the speed at which the signal travels . The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system : the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function . To understand how this works , let ’ s consider an example . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , an autoimmune disorder , involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout the nervous system . The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms , such as dizziness , fatigue , loss of motor control , and sexual dysfunction . While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and manage certain symptoms , there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis .",0.9166486859321594,1.0
46,"As noted earlier , when the action potential arrives at the terminal button , the synaptic vesicles release their neurotransmitters into the synapse . The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron , and the process repeats itself in the new neuron ( assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential ) . Once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away , are broken down into inactive fragments , or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake . Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the synapse ( Figure 3.12 ) . Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear “ on ” and “ off ” state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter ( full synaptic vesicles provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced ) .",0.7291044592857361,0.0

47,"You have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar , glucose . Glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism . Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism . The process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic . Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells . Glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways . One method is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient . The other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins , also known as glucose transporter proteins . These transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose . Glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate . Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases . The first part of the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two three-carbon molecules . The second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of ATP and NADH , the reduced form of NAD .",1.0018197298049927,0.0

Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA , and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells .

47,"An early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the sun ’ s energy using water as a source of hydrogen atoms , but this pathway did not produce free oxygen ( anoxygenic photosynthesis ) . ( Early photosynthesis did not produce free oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen ions ; instead , it used materials like hydrogen sulfide and consequently produced sulfur ) . It is thought that glycolysis could take advantage of the simple sugars being produced , but these reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates . The development of glycolysis probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis , as it was well suited to extract energy from materials spontaneously accumulating in the “ primeval soup . ” A later form of photosynthesis used water as a source of electrons and hydrogen , and generated free oxygen . Over time , the atmosphere became oxygenated , but not before the oxygen released oxidized metals in the ocean and created a “ rust ” layer in the sediment , permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic photosynthesizers . Living things adapted to exploit this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to evolve . When the full process of oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated , cells were finally able to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation . 7.7 Regulation of Cellular Respiration Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :",0.7648999691009521,0.0

48,"You may occasionally see platelets referred to as thrombocytes , but because this name suggests they are a type of cell , it is not accurate . A platelet is not a cell but rather a fragment of the cytoplasm of a cell called a megakaryocyte that is surrounded by a plasma membrane . Megakaryocytes are descended from myeloid stem cells ( see Figure 18.4 ) and are large , typically 50 – 100 µ m in diameter , and contain an enlarged , lobed nucleus . As noted earlier , thrombopoietin , a glycoprotein secreted by the kidneys and liver , stimulates the proliferation of megakaryoblasts , which mature into megakaryocytes . These remain within bone marrow tissue ( Figure 18.12 ) and ultimately form platelet-precursor extensions that extend through the walls of bone marrow capillaries to release into the circulation thousands of cytoplasmic fragments , each enclosed by a bit of plasma membrane . These enclosed fragments are platelets . Each megakarocyte releases 2000 – 3000 platelets during its lifespan . Following platelet release , megakaryocyte remnants , which are little more than a cell nucleus , are consumed by macrophages . Platelets are relatively small , 2 – 4 µ m in diameter , but numerous , with typically 150,000 – 160,000 per µ L of blood . After entering the circulation , approximately one-third migrate to the spleen for storage for later release in response to any rupture in a blood vessel .

48,"To avoid transfusion reactions , it is best to transfuse only matching blood types ; that is , a type B + recipient should ideally receive blood only from a type B + donor and so on . That said , in emergency situations , when acute hemorrhage threatens the patient ’ s life , there may not be time for cross matching to identify blood type . In these cases , blood from a universal donor — an individual with type O − blood — may be transfused . Recall that type O erythrocytes do not display A or B antigens . Thus , anti-A or anti-B antibodies that might be circulating in the patient ’ s blood plasma will not encounter any erythrocyte surface antigens on the donated blood and therefore will not be provoked into a response . One problem with this designation of universal donor is if the O − individual had prior exposure to Rh antigen , Rh antibodies may be present in the donated blood . Also , introducing type O blood into an individual with type A , B , or AB blood will nevertheless introduce antibodies against both A and B antigens , as these are always circulating in the type O blood plasma . This may cause problems for the recipient , but because the volume of blood transfused is much lower than the volume of the patient ’ s own blood , the adverse effects of the relatively few infused plasma antibodies are typically limited . Rh factor also plays a role . If Rh − individuals receiving blood have had prior exposure to Rh antigen , antibodies for this antigen may be present in the blood and trigger agglutination to some degree .

48,"The kidneys filter about 180 liters ( ~ 380 pints ) of blood in an average adult each day , or about 20 percent of the total resting volume , and thus serve as ideal sites for receptors that determine oxygen saturation . In response to hypoxemia , less oxygen will exit the vessels supplying the kidney , resulting in hypoxia ( low oxygen concentration ) in the tissue fluid of the kidney where oxygen concentration is actually monitored . Interstitial fibroblasts within the kidney secrete EPO , thereby increasing erythrocyte production and restoring oxygen levels . In a classic negative-feedback loop , as oxygen saturation rises , EPO secretion falls , and vice versa , thereby maintaining homeostasis . Populations dwelling at high elevations , with inherently lower levels of oxygen in the atmosphere , naturally maintain a hematocrit higher than people living at sea level . Consequently , people traveling to high elevations may experience symptoms of hypoxemia , such as fatigue , headache , and shortness of breath , for a few days after their arrival . In response to the hypoxemia , the kidneys secrete EPO to step up the production of erythrocytes until homeostasis is achieved once again . To avoid the symptoms of hypoxemia , or altitude sickness , mountain climbers typically rest for several days to a week or more at a series of camps situated at increasing elevations to allow EPO levels and , consequently , erythrocyte counts to rise . When climbing the tallest peaks , such as Mt . Everest and K2 in the Himalayas , many mountain climbers rely upon bottled oxygen as they near the summit .",0.4011782705783844,0.0

48,"In contrast to the disorders characterized by coagulation failure is thrombocytosis , also mentioned earlier , a condition characterized by excessive numbers of platelets that increases the risk for excessive clot formation , a condition known as thrombosis . A thrombus ( plural = thrombi ) is an aggregation of platelets , erythrocytes , and even WBCs typically trapped within a mass of fibrin strands . While the formation of a clot is normal following the hemostatic mechanism just described , thrombi can form within an intact or only slightly damaged blood vessel . In a large vessel , a thrombus will adhere to the vessel wall and decrease the flow of blood , and is referred to as a mural thrombus . In a small vessel , it may actually totally block the flow of blood and is termed an occlusive thrombus . Thrombi are most commonly caused by vessel damage to the endothelial lining , which activates the clotting mechanism . These may include venous stasis , when blood in the veins , particularly in the legs , remains stationary for long periods . This is one of the dangers of long airplane flights in crowded conditions and may lead to deep vein thrombosis .

48,"Erythrocytes are biconcave disks ; that is , they are plump at their periphery and very thin in the center ( Figure 18.6 ) . Since they lack most organelles , there is more interior space for the presence of the hemoglobin molecules that , as you will see shortly , transport gases . The biconcave shape also provides a greater surface area across which gas exchange can occur , relative to its volume ; a sphere of a similar diameter would have a lower surface area-to-volume ratio . In the capillaries , the oxygen carried by the erythrocytes can diffuse into the plasma and then through the capillary walls to reach the cells , whereas some of the carbon dioxide produced by the cells as a waste product diffuses into the capillaries to be picked up by the erythrocytes . Capillary beds are extremely narrow , slowing the passage of the erythrocytes and providing an extended opportunity for gas exchange to occur . However , the space within capillaries can be so minute that , despite their own small size , erythrocytes may have to fold in on themselves if they are to make their way through . Fortunately , their structural proteins like spectrin are flexible , allowing them to bend over themselves to a surprising degree , then spring back again when they enter a wider vessel .

When the number of RBCs or hemoglobin is deficient , the general condition is called anemia . There are more than 400 types of anemia and more than 3.5 million Americans suffer from this condition . Anemia can be broken down into three major groups : those caused by blood loss , those caused by faulty or decreased RBC production , and those caused by excessive destruction of RBCs . Clinicians often use two groupings in diagnosis : The kinetic approach focuses on evaluating the production , destruction , and removal of RBCs , whereas the morphological approach examines the RBCs themselves , paying particular emphasis to their size . A common test is the mean corpuscle volume ( MCV ) , which measures size . Normal-sized cells are referred to as normocytic , smaller-than-normal cells are referred to as microcytic , and larger-than-normal cells are referred to as macrocytic . Reticulocyte counts are also important and may reveal inadequate production of RBCs . The effects of the various anemias are widespread , because reduced numbers of RBCs or hemoglobin will result in lower levels of oxygen being delivered to body tissues . Since oxygen is required for tissue functioning , anemia produces fatigue , lethargy , and an increased risk for infection .

Vitamin K ( along with biotin and folate ) is somewhat unusual among vitamins in that it is not only consumed in the diet but is also synthesized by bacteria residing in the large intestine . The calcium ion , considered factor IV , is derived from the diet and from the breakdown of bone . Some recent evidence indicates that activation of various clotting factors occurs on specific receptor sites on the surfaces of platelets . The 12 clotting factors are numbered I through XIII according to the order of their discovery . Factor VI was once believed to be a distinct clotting factor , but is now thought to be identical to factor V . Rather than renumber the other factors , factor VI was allowed to remain as a placeholder and also a reminder that knowledge changes over time .",1.0197373628616333,0.0

48,"Another reason for failure of the blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more clotting factors . This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia , which is actually a group of related disorders , the most common of which is hemophilia A , accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases . This disorder results in the inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII . Hemophilia B is the second most common form , accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases . In this case , there is a deficiency of factor IX . Both of these defects are linked to the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy ( carrier ) mother to her male offspring , since males are XY . Females would need to inherit a defective gene from each parent to manifest the disease , since they are XX . Patients with hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds , and leak blood into joint spaces after exercise and into urine and stool . Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an autosomal ( not sex ) chromosome that renders factor XI nonfunctional . It is not a true recessive condition , since even individuals with a single copy of the mutant gene show a tendency to bleed . Regular infusions of clotting factors isolated from healthy donors can help prevent bleeding in hemophiliac patients .
