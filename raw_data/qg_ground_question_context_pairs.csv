0,Which of the following is a cause of the stock market crash of 1929?,"The Florida land boom went bust in 1925 – 1926 . A combination of negative press about the speculative nature of the boom , IRS investigations into the questionable financial practices of several land brokers , and a railroad embargo that limited the delivery of construction supplies into the region significantly hampered investor interest . The subsequent Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 drove most land developers into outright bankruptcy . However , speculation continued throughout the decade , this time in the stock market .  Buyers purchased stock “ on margin ” — buying for a small down payment with borrowed money , with the intention of quickly selling at a much higher price before the remaining payment came due — which worked well as long as prices continued to rise .  Speculators were aided by retail stock brokerage firms , which catered to average investors anxious to play the market but lacking direct ties to investment banking houses or larger brokerage firms . When prices began to fluctuate in the summer of 1929 , investors sought excuses to continue their speculation . When fluctuations turned to outright and steady losses , everyone started to sell . As September began to unfold , the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at a value of 381 points , or roughly ten times the stock market ’ s value , at the start of the 1920s ."
0,Which of the following groups would not be considered “the deserving poor” by social welfare groups and humanitarians in the 1930s?," As the effects of the Great Depression worsened , wealthier Americans had particular concern for “ the deserving poor ” — those who had lost all of their money due to no fault of their own .  This concept gained greater attention beginning in the Progressive Era of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , when early social reformers sought to improve the quality of life for all Americans by addressing the poverty that was becoming more prevalent , particularly in emerging urban areas . By the time of the Great Depression , social reformers and humanitarian agencies had determined that the “ deserving poor ” belonged to a different category from those who had speculated and lost . However , the sheer volume of Americans who fell into this group meant that charitable assistance could not begin to reach them all . Some fifteen million “ deserving poor , ” or a full one-third of the labor force , were struggling by 1932 . The country had no mechanism or system in place to help so many ; however , Hoover remained adamant that such relief should rest in the hands of private agencies , not with the federal government ( Figure 25.7 ) ."
0,"Which of the following protests was directly related to federal policies, and thus had the greatest impact in creating a negative public perception of the Hoover presidency?"," One of the most notable protest movements occurred toward the end of Hoover ’ s presidency and centered on the Bonus Expeditionary Force , or Bonus Army , in the spring of 1932 .  In this protest , approximately fifteen thousand World War I veterans marched on Washington to demand early payment of their veteran bonuses , which were not due to be paid until 1945 . The group camped out in vacant federal buildings and set up camps in Anacostia Flats near the Capitol building ( Figure 25.10 ) ."
0,Which of the following groups or bodies did not offer direct relief to needy people?,"In keeping with these principles , Hoover ’ s response to the crash focused on two very common American traditions : He asked individuals to tighten their belts and work harder , and he asked the business community to voluntarily help sustain the economy by retaining workers and continuing production . He immediately summoned a conference of leading industrialists to meet in Washington , DC , urging them to maintain their current wages while America rode out this brief economic panic . The crash , he assured business leaders , was not part of a greater downturn ; they had nothing to worry about . Similar meetings with utility companies and railroad executives elicited promises for billions of dollars in new construction projects , while labor leaders agreed to withhold demands for wage increases and workers continued to labor . Hoover also persuaded Congress to pass a $ 160 million tax cut to bolster American incomes , leading many to conclude that the president was doing all he could to stem the tide of the panic . In April 1930 , the New York Times editorial board concluded that “ No one in his place could have done more . ” However , these modest steps were not enough . By late 1931 , when it became clear that the economy would not improve on its own , Hoover recognized the need for some government intervention .  He created the President ’ s Emergency Committee for Employment ( PECE ) , later renamed the President ’ s Organization of Unemployment Relief ( POUR ) .   In keeping with Hoover ’ s distaste of what he viewed as handouts , this organization did not provide direct federal relief to people in need .  Instead , it assisted state and private relief agencies , such as the Red Cross , Salvation Army , YMCA , and Community Chest . Hoover also strongly urged people of means to donate funds to help the poor , and he himself gave significant private donations to worthy causes . But these private efforts could not alleviate the widespread effects of poverty . Congress pushed for a more direct government response to the hardship . In 1930 – 1931 , it attempted to pass a $ 60 million bill to provide relief to drought victims by allowing them access to food , fertilizer , and animal feed . Hoover stood fast in his refusal to provide food , resisting any element of direct relief . The final bill of $ 47 million provided for everything except food but did not come close to adequately addressing the crisis . Again in 1931 , Congress proposed the Federal Emergency Relief Bill , which would have provided $ 375 million to states to help provide food , clothing , and shelter to the homeless . But Hoover opposed the bill , stating that it ruined the balance of power between states and the federal government , and in February 1932 , it was defeated by fourteen votes . However , the president ’ s adamant opposition to direct-relief federal government programs should not be viewed as one of indifference or uncaring toward the suffering American people . His personal sympathy for those in need was boundless . Hoover was one of only two presidents to reject his salary for the office he held . Throughout the Great Depression , he donated an average of $ 25,000 annually to various relief organizations to assist in their efforts . Furthermore , he helped to raise $ 500,000 in private funds to support the White House Conference on Child Health and Welfare in 1930 . Rather than indifference or heartlessness , Hoover ’ s steadfast adherence to a philosophy of individualism as the path toward long-term American recovery explained many of his policy decisions . “ A voluntary deed , ” he repeatedly commented , “ is infinitely more precious to our national ideal and spirit than a thousand-fold poured from the Treasury . ”"
0,Which of the following hardships did African Americans not typically face during the Great Depression?,"In cities , African Americans fared no better .  Unemployment was rampant , and many Whites felt that any available jobs belonged to Whites first .   In some Northern cities , Whites would conspire to have African American workers fired to allow White workers access to their jobs .   Even jobs traditionally held by Black workers , such as household servants or janitors , were now going to Whites .   By 1932 , approximately one-half of all Black Americans were unemployed .   Racial violence also began to rise .   In the South , lynching became more common again , with twenty-eight documented lynchings in 1933 , compared to eight in 1932 .  Since communities were preoccupied with their own hardships , and organizing civil rights efforts was a long , difficult process , many resigned themselves to , or even ignored , this culture of racism and violence . Occasionally , however , an incident was notorious enough to gain national attention . Most African Americans did not participate in the land boom and stock market speculation that preceded the crash , but that did not stop the effects of the Great Depression from hitting them particularly hard . Subject to continuing racial discrimination , Blacks nationwide fared even worse than their hard-hit White counterparts .  As the prices for cotton and other agricultural products plummeted , farm owners paid workers less or simply laid them off .  Landlords evicted sharecroppers , and even those who owned their land outright had to abandon it when there was no way to earn any income ."
0,Which of the following was not a key factor in the conditions that led to the Dust Bowl?," Livestock died , or had to be sold , as there was no money for feed .   Crops intended to feed the family withered and died in the drought .  Terrifying dust storms became more and more frequent , as “ black blizzards ” of dirt blew across the landscape and created a new illness known as “ dust pneumonia . ” In 1935 alone , over 850 million tons of topsoil blew away . To put this number in perspective , geologists estimate that it takes the earth five hundred years to naturally regenerate one inch of topsoil ; yet , just one significant dust storm could destroy a similar amount .  In their desperation to get more from the land , farmers had stripped it of the delicate balance that kept it healthy .   Unaware of the consequences , they had moved away from such traditional practices as crop rotation and allowing land to regain its strength by permitting it to lie fallow between plantings , working the land to death .  Exacerbating the problem was a massive drought that began in 1931 and lasted for eight terrible years .  Dust storms roiled through the Great Plains , creating huge , choking clouds that piled up in doorways and filtered into homes through closed windows .   Even more quickly than it had boomed , the land of agricultural opportunity went bust , due to widespread overproduction and overuse of the land , as well as to the harsh weather conditions that followed , resulting in the creation of the Dust Bowl ( Figure 25.13 ) . "
0,Which assessment of Herbert Hoover’s presidency is most accurate?,"As so much of the Hoover presidency is circumscribed by the onset of the Great Depression , one must be careful in assessing his successes and failures , so as not to attribute all blame to Hoover . Given the suffering that many Americans endured between the fall of 1929 and Franklin Roosevelt ’ s inauguration in the spring of 1933 , it is easy to lay much of the blame at Hoover ’ s doorstep ( Figure 25.16 ) . However , the extent to which Hoover was constrained by the economic circumstances unfolding well before he assumed office offers a few mitigating factors .  Put simply , Hoover did not cause the stock market crash .   However , his stubborn adherence to a questionable belief in “ American individualism , ” despite mounting evidence that people were starving , requires that some blame be attributed to his policies ( or lack thereof ) for the depth and length of the Depression .  Yet , Hoover ’ s presidency was much more than simply combating the Depression . To assess the extent of his inability to provide meaningful national leadership through the darkest months of the Depression , his other policies require consideration ."
0,Which of the following phrases best characterizes Herbert Hoover’s foreign policy agenda?,"Although it was a relatively quiet period for U . S . diplomacy , Hoover did help to usher in a period of positive relations , specifically with several Latin American neighbors . This would establish the basis for Franklin Roosevelt ’ s “ Good Neighbor ” policy .  After a goodwill tour of Central American countries immediately following his election in 1928 , Hoover shaped the subsequent Clark Memorandum — released in 1930 — which largely repudiated the previous Roosevelt Corollary , establishing a basis for unlimited American military intervention throughout Latin America .   To the contrary , through the memorandum , Hoover asserted that greater emphasis should be placed upon the older Monroe Doctrine , in which the U . S . pledged assistance to her Latin American neighbors should any European powers interfere in Western Hemisphere affairs .  Hoover further strengthened relations to the south by withdrawing American troops from Haiti and Nicaragua . Additionally , he outlined with Secretary of State Henry Stimson the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine , which announced that the United States would never recognize claims to territories seized by force ( a direct response to the recent Japanese invasion of Manchuria ) . Other diplomatic overtures met with less success for Hoover . Most notably , in an effort to support the American economy during the early stages of the Depression , the president signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930 . The law , which raised tariffs on thousands of imports , was intended to increase sales of American-made goods , but predictably angered foreign trade partners who in turn raised their tariffs on American imports , thus shrinking international trade and closing additional markets to desperate American manufacturers . As a result , the global depression worsened further . A similar attempt to spur the world economy , known as the Hoover Moratorium , likewise met with great opposition and little economic benefit . Issued in 1931 , the moratorium called for a halt to World War I reparations to be paid by Germany to France , as well as forgiveness of Allied war debts to the U . S ."
1,To what form of government did the American revolutionaries turn after the war for independence?,"While monarchies dominated eighteenth-century Europe , American revolutionaries were determined to find an alternative to this method of government . Radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine , whose enormously popular essay Common Sense was first published in January 1776 , advocated a republic : a state without a king . Six months later , Jefferson ’ s Declaration of Independence affirmed the break with England but did not suggest what form of government should replace monarchy , the only system most English colonists had ever known . In the late eighteenth century , republics were few and far between . Genoa , Venice , and the Dutch Republic provided examples of states without monarchs , but many European Enlightenment thinkers questioned the stability of a republic .  Nonetheless , after their break from Great Britain , Americans turned to republicanism for their new government . "
1,Which of the following was not one of Franklin’s thirteen virtues?,"11 .  Tranquillity .   Be not disturbed at trifles , or at accidents common or unavoidable .  7 .  Sincerity .   Use no hurtful deceit ; think innocently and justly , and , if you speak , speak accordingly .  1 .  Temperance .   Eat not to dullness ; drink not to elevation .   Defining American Benjamin Franklin ’ s Thirteen Virtues for Character Development In the 1780s , Benjamin Franklin carefully defined thirteen virtues to help guide his countrymen in maintaining a virtuous republic .   His choice of thirteen is telling since he wrote for the citizens of the thirteen new American republics .   These virtues were : "
1,Which of the following figures did not actively challenge the status of women in the early American republic?," Adams , Murray , and Warren all came from privileged backgrounds .   All three were fully literate , while many women in the American republic were not .  Their literacy and station allowed them to push for new roles for women in the atmosphere of unique possibility created by the Revolution and its promise of change .  Female authors who published their work provide evidence of how women in the era of the American Revolution challenged traditional gender roles .   Inspired by the Revolution , Judith Sargent Murray of Massachusetts advocated women ’ s economic independence and equal educational opportunities for men and women ( Figure 7.5 ) .  Murray , who came from a well-to-do family in Gloucester , questioned why boys were given access to education as a birthright while girls had very limited educational opportunities . She began to publish her ideas about educational equality beginning in the 1780s , arguing that God had made the minds of women and men equal .  Another privileged member of the revolutionary generation , Mercy Otis Warren , also challenged gender assumptions and traditions during the revolutionary era ( Figure 7.5 ) .  Born in Massachusetts , Warren actively opposed British reform measures before the outbreak of fighting in 1775 by publishing anti-British works . In 1812 , she published a three-volume history of the Revolution , a project she had started in the late 1770s . By publishing her work , Warren stepped out of the female sphere and into the otherwise male-dominated sphere of public life .  Some women hoped to overturn coverture .   From her home in Braintree , Massachusetts , Abigail Adams ( Figure 7.4 ) wrote to her husband , Whig leader John Adams , in 1776 , “ In the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make , I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestor .  Do not put such unlimited power in the husbands . Remember , all men would be tyrants if they could . ” Abigail Adams ran the family homestead during the Revolution , but she did not have the ability to conduct business without her husband ’ s consent . Elsewhere in the famous 1776 letter quoted above , she speaks of the difficulties of running the homestead when her husband is away . Her frustration grew when her husband responded in an April 1776 letter : “ As to your extraordinary Code of Laws , I cannot but laugh . We have been told that our Struggle has loosened the bands of Government every where . That Children and Apprentices were disobedient — that schools and Colledges were grown turbulent — that Indians slighted their Guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their Masters . But your Letter was the first Intimation that another Tribe more numerous and powerfull than all the rest were grown discontented . . . . Depend on it , We know better than to repeal our Masculine systems . ”"
1,Which state had the clearest separation of church and state?,"During the colonial era in Virginia , the established church had been the Church of England , which did not tolerate Catholics , Baptists , or followers or other religions .  In 1786 , as a revolutionary response against the privileged status of the Church of England , Virginia ’ s lawmakers approved the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom , which ended the Church of England ’ s hold and allowed religious liberty .  Under the statute , no one could be forced to attend or support a specific church or be prosecuted for his or her beliefs . Prior to the Revolution , several colonies had official , tax-supported churches .  After the Revolution , some questioned the validity of state-authorized churches ; the limitation of public office-holding to those of a particular faith ; and the payment of taxes to support churches .   In other states , especially in New England where the older Puritan heritage cast a long shadow , religion and state remained intertwined . "
1,Which of the following states had the most democratic constitution in the 1780s?,"Conservative Whigs , who distrusted the idea of majority rule , recoiled from the abolition of property qualifications for voting and office holding in Pennsylvania .  Conservative Whig John Adams reacted with horror to the 1776 Pennsylvania constitution , declaring that it was “ so democratical that it must produce confusion and every evil work . ” In his mind and those of other conservative Whigs , this constitution simply put too much power in the hands of men who had no business exercising the right to vote .  Pennsylvania ’ s constitution also eliminated the executive branch ( there was no governor ) and the upper house . Instead , Pennsylvania had a one-house — a unicameral — legislature . The 1776 Pennsylvania constitution and the 1784 New Hampshire constitution both provide examples of democratic tendencies . In Pennsylvania , the requirement to own property in order to vote was eliminated , and if a man was twenty-one or older , had paid taxes , and had lived in the same location for one year , he could vote ( Figure 7.10 ) . This opened voting to most free White male citizens of Pennsylvania .  The 1784 New Hampshire constitution allowed every small town and village to send representatives to the state government , making the lower house of the legislature a model of democratic government . "
1,"Under the Articles of Confederation, what power did the national Confederation Congress have?"," The Confederation Congress under the Articles did achieve success through a series of directives called land ordinances , which established rules for the settlement of western lands in the public domain and the admission of new states to the republic .  The ordinances were designed to prepare the land for sale to citizens and raise revenue to boost the failing economy of the republic . In the land ordinances , the Confederation Congress created the Mississippi and Southwest Territories and stipulated that slavery would be permitted there . The system of dividing the vast domains of the United States stands as a towering achievement of the era , a blueprint for American western expansion ."
1,Which plan resolved the issue of representation for the U.S. Constitution?," Roger Sherman from Connecticut offered a compromise to break the deadlock over the thorny question of representation .   His Connecticut Compromise , also known as the Great Compromise , outlined a different bicameral legislature in which the upper house , the Senate , would have equal representation for all states ; each state would be represented by two senators chosen by the state legislatures .  Only the lower house , the House of Representatives , would have proportional representation ."
1,How was the U.S. Constitution ratified?,"The draft constitution was finished in September 1787 .  The delegates decided that in order for the new national government to be implemented , each state must first hold a special ratifying convention .   When nine of the thirteen had approved the plan , the constitution would go into effect . "
2,Who determines which illnesses are stigmatized?,"People with disabilities can be stigmatized by their illness .  Stigmatization means that their identity is spoiled ; they are labeled as different , discriminated against , and sometimes even shunned .   They are labeled ( as an interactionist might point out ) and ascribed a master status ( as a functionalist might note ) , becoming “ the blind girl ” or “ the boy in the wheelchair ” instead of someone afforded a full identity by society .  This can be especially true for people who are disabled due to mental illness or disorders .  For instance , sociologist Erving Goffman ( 1963 ) described how social stigmas hinder individuals from fully integrating into society .   The stigmatization of illness often has the greatest effect on the patient and the kind of care he or she receives .   Many contend that our society and even our health care institutions discriminate against certain diseases — like mental disorders , AIDS , venereal diseases , and skin disorders ( Sartorius 2007 ) .  Facilities for these diseases may be sub-par ; they may be segregated from other health care areas or relegated to a poorer environment . The stigma may keep people from seeking help for their illness , making it worse than it needs to be . The Cultural Meaning of Illness Many medical sociologists contend that illnesses have both a biological and an experiential component , and that these components exist independently of each other .  Our culture , not our biology , dictates which illnesses are stigmatized and which are not , which are considered disabilities and which are not , and which are deemed contestable ( meaning some medical professionals may find the existence of this ailment questionable ) as opposed to definitive ( illnesses that are unquestionably recognized in the medical profession ) ( Conrad and Barker 2010 ) . "
2,Chronic fatigue syndrome is an example of _______________.," Contested illnesses are those that are questioned or questionable by some medical professionals .   Disorders like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome may be either true illnesses or only in the patients ’ heads , depending on the opinion of the medical professional .  This dynamic can affect how a patient seeks treatment and what kind of treatment he or she receives ."
2,The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is an example of ________________," Today , many institutions of wellness acknowledge the degree to which individual perceptions shape the nature of health and illness .   Regarding physical activity , for instance , the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) recommends that individuals use a standard level of exertion to assess their physical activity .   This Rating of Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) gives a more complete view of an individual ’ s actual exertion level , since heart-rate or pulse measurements may be affected by medication or other issues ( Centers for Disease Control 2011a ) .  Similarly , many medical professionals use a comparable scale for perceived pain to help determine pain management strategies .  The Social Construction of the Illness Experience The idea of the social construction of the illness experience is based on the concept of reality as a social construction .   In other words , there is no objective reality ; there are only our own perceptions of it .   The social construction of the illness experience deals with such issues as the way some patients control the manner in which they reveal their disease and the lifestyle adaptations patients develop to cope with their illnesses .  The social construction of health is a major research topic within medical sociology . At first glance , the concept of a social construction of health does not seem to make sense . After all , if disease is a measurable , physiological problem , then there can be no question of socially constructing disease , right ? Well , it ’ s not that simple .  The idea of the social construction of health emphasizes the socio-cultural aspects of the discipline ’ s approach to physical , objectively definable phenomena .  Sociologists Conrad and Barker ( 2010 ) offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the major findings of the last 50 years of development in this concept . Their summary categorizes the findings in the field under three subheadings : the cultural meaning of illness , the social construction of the illness experience , and the social construction of medical knowledge ."
2,What is social epidemiology?," Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases .  Social epidemiology can reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations . These epidemiological studies show that the health problems of high-income nations differ greatly from those of low-income nations . Some diseases , like cancer , are universal . But others , like obesity , heart disease , respiratory disease , and diabetes are much more common in high-income countries , and are a direct result of a sedentary lifestyle combined with poor diet . High-income nations also have a higher incidence of depression ( Bromet et al . 2011 ) . In contrast , low-income nations suffer significantly from malaria and tuberculosis ."
2,Many deaths in high-income nations are linked to __________________," Health in High-Income Nations Obesity , which is on the rise in high-income nations , has been linked to many diseases , including cardiovascular problems , musculoskeletal problems , diabetes , and respiratory issues .   According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( 2011 ) , obesity rates are rising in all countries , with the greatest gains being made in the highest-income countries .  The United States has the highest obesity rate . Wallace Huffman and his fellow researchers ( 2006 ) contend that several factors are contributing to the rise in obesity in developed countries : Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases . Social epidemiology can reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations . These epidemiological studies show that the health problems of high-income nations differ greatly from those of low-income nations . Some diseases , like cancer , are universal .  But others , like obesity , heart disease , respiratory disease , and diabetes are much more common in high-income countries , and are a direct result of a sedentary lifestyle combined with poor diet .  High-income nations also have a higher incidence of depression ( Bromet et al . 2011 ) . In contrast , low-income nations suffer significantly from malaria and tuberculosis ."
2,"According to the World Health Organization, what was the most frequent cause of death for children under five in low income countries?"," The most frequent causes of death for children under five were pneumonia and diarrheal diseases , accounting for 18 percent and 15 percent , respectively .  These deaths could be easily avoidable with cleaner water and more coverage of available medical care ."
2,Which of the following statements is not true?," Among whites , Hispanic whites received 60 percent inferior care of measures compared to non-Hispanic whites ( Agency for Health Research and Quality 2010 ) .   When considering access to care , the figures were comparable .  Health by Race and Ethnicity When looking at the social epidemiology of the United States , it is hard to miss the disparities among races .  The discrepancy between black and white Americans shows the gap clearly ; IN 2008 , the average life expectancy for white males was approximately five years longer than for black males : 75.9 compared to 70.9 .   An even stronger disparity was found in 2007 : the infant mortality rate for blacks was nearly twice that of whites at 13.2 compared to 5.6 per 1,000 live births ( U . S . Census Bureau 2011 ) .   According to a report from the Henry J . Kaiser Foundation ( 2007 ) , African Americans also have higher incidence of several other diseases and causes of mortality , from cancer to heart disease to diabetes .  In a similar vein , it is important to note that ethnic minorities , including Mexican Americans and Native Americans , also have higher rates of these diseases and causes of mortality than whites .  Globally , the rate of mortality for children under five was 60 per 1,000 live births .   In low-income countries , however , that rate is almost double at 117 per 1,000 live births .  In high-income countries , that rate is significantly lower than seven per 1,000 live births ."
2,The process by which aspects of life that were considered bad or deviant are redefined as sickness and needing medical attention to remedy is called:,"We can see an example of institutionalized sexism in the way that women are more likely than men to be diagnosed with certain kinds of mental disorders . Psychologist Dana Becker notes that 75 percent of all diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD ) are for women according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . This diagnosis is characterized by instability of identity , of mood , and of behavior , and Becker argues that it has been used as a catch-all diagnosis for too many women . She further decries the pejorative connotation of the diagnosis , saying that it predisposes many people , both within and outside of the profession of psychotherapy , against women who have been so diagnosed ( Becker ) . Many critics also point to the medicalization of women ’ s issues as an example of institutionalized sexism .  Medicalization refers to the process by which previously normal aspects of life are redefined as deviant and needing medical attention to remedy .  Historically and contemporaneously , many aspects of women ’ s lives have been medicalized , including menstruation , pre-menstrual syndrome , pregnancy , childbirth , and menopause . The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth has been particularly contentious in recent decades , with many women opting against the medical process and choosing a more natural childbirth . Fox and Worts ( 1999 ) find that all women experience pain and anxiety during the birth process , but that social support relieves both as effectively as medical support . In other words , medical interventions are no more effective than social ones at helping with the difficulties of pain and childbirth . Fox and Worts further found that women with supportive partners ended up with less medical intervention and fewer cases of postpartum depression . Of course , access to quality birth care outside of the standard medical models may not be readily available to women of all social classes ."
2,What are the most commonly diagnosed mental disorders in the United States?," According to the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , the most common mental disorders in the United States are anxiety disorders .  Almost 18 percent of American adults are likely to be affected in a single year , and 28 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime ( National Institute of Mental Health 2005 ) . It is important to distinguish between occasional feelings of anxiety and a true anxiety disorder . Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point , but anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time . Anxiety disorders include obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , panic disorders , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and both social and specific phobias ."
2,The high unemployment rate among the disabled may be a result of ____________.," As discussed in the section on mental health , many mental health disorders can be debilitating , affecting a person ’ s ability to cope with everyday life .   This can affect social status , housing , and especially employment .   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( 2011 ) , people with a disability had a higher rate of unemployment thaN people without a disability in 2010 : 14.8 percent to 9.4 percent .  This unemployment rate refers only to people actively looking for a job . In fact , eight out of 10 people with a disability are considered “ out of the labor force ; ” that is , they do not have jobs and are not looking for them . The combination of this population and the high unemployment rate leads to an employment-population ratio of 18.6 percent among those with disabilities . The employment-population ratio for people without disabilities was much higher , at 63.5 percent ( U . S . Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011 ) .  People with disabilities can be stigmatized by their illness .   Stigmatization means that their identity is spoiled ; they are labeled as different , discriminated against , and sometimes even shunned .  They are labeled ( as an interactionist might point out ) and ascribed a master status ( as a functionalist might note ) , becoming “ the blind girl ” or “ the boy in the wheelchair ” instead of someone afforded a full identity by society .  This can be especially true for people who are disabled due to mental illness or disorders . "
2,Which public health care system offers insurance primarily to people over 65?,"United States health care coverage can broadly be divided into two main categories : public health care ( government-funded ) and private health care ( privately funded ) .  The two main publicly funded health care programs are Medicare , which provides health services to people over 65 years old as well as people who meet other standards for disability , and Medicaid , which provides services to people with very low incomes who meet other eligibility requirements .  Other government-funded programs include service agencies focused on Native Americans ( the Indian Health Service ) , Veterans ( the Veterans Health Administration ) , and children ( the Children ’ s Health Insurance Program ) . A controversial issue in 2011 was a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget , which would almost certainly require billions of dollars in cuts to these programs . As discussed below , the United States already has a significant problem with lack of health care coverage for many individuals ; if these budget cuts pass , the already heavily burdened programs are sure to suffer , and so are the people they serve ( Kogan 2011 ) ."
2,Which program is an example of socialized medicine?,"One critique of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is that it will create a system of socialized medicine , a term that for many Americans has negative connotations lingering from the Cold War era and earlier .  Under a socialized medicine system , the government owns and runs the system .  It employs the doctors , nurses , and other staff , and it owns and runs the hospitals ( Klein 2009 ) . The best example of socialized medicine is in Great Britain , where the National Health System ( NHS ) gives free health care to all its residents .  And despite some Americans ’ knee-jerk reaction to any health care changes that hint of socialism , the United States has one socialized system with the Veterans Health Administration . "
2,What will the individual mandate provision of the 2010 U.S. health care reform do?," Health care in the United States is a complex issue , and it will only get more so with the continued enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) of 2010 .  This Act , sometimes called “ ObamaCare ” for its most noted advocate , President Barack Obama , represents large-scale federal reform of the United States ’ health care system . Most of the provisions of the Act will take effect by 2014 , but some were effective immediately on passage . The PPACA aims to address some of the biggest flaws of the current health care system . It expands eligibility to programs like Medicaid and CHIP , helps guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions , and establishes regulations to make sure that the premium funds collected by insurers and care providers go directly to medical care .  It also includes an individual mandate , which requires everyone to have insurance coverage by 2014 or pay a penalty .  A series of provisions , including significant subsidies , are intended to address the discrepancies in income that are currently contributing to high rates of uninsurance and underinsurance ."
2,Great Britain’s health care system is an example of ______________,"One critique of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is that it will create a system of socialized medicine , a term that for many Americans has negative connotations lingering from the Cold War era and earlier . Under a socialized medicine system , the government owns and runs the system . It employs the doctors , nurses , and other staff , and it owns and runs the hospitals ( Klein 2009 ) .  The best example of socialized medicine is in Great Britain , where the National Health System ( NHS ) gives free health care to all its residents .  And despite some Americans ’ knee-jerk reaction to any health care changes that hint of socialism , the United States has one socialized system with the Veterans Health Administration ."
2,What group created the Millennium Development Goals?," WHO , which is the health arm of the United Nations , set eight Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) in 2000 with the aim of reaching these goals by 2015 .  Some of the goals deal more broadly with the socioeconomic factors that influence health , but MDGs 4 , 5 , and 6 all relate specifically to large-scale health concerns , the likes of which most Americans will never contemplate . MDG 4 is to reduce child mortality , MDG 5 aims to improve maternal health , and MDG 6 strives to combat HIV / AIDS , malaria , and other diseases . The goals may not seem particularly dramatic , but the numbers behind them show how serious they are . One of the biggest contributors to medical issues in low-income countries is the lack of access to clean water and basic sanitation resources . According to a 2011 UNICEF report , almost half of the developing world ’ s population lacks improved sanitation facilities .  The World Health Organization ( WHO ) tracks health-related data for 193 countries .  In their 2011 World Health Statistics report , they document the following statistics :"
2,Which of the following is not part of the rights and responsibilities of a sick person under the functionalist perspective?," The responsibility of the sick person is twofold : to try to get well and to seek technically competent help from a physician .  If the sick person stays ill longer than is appropriate ( malingers ) , she may be stigmatized .  According to Parsons , the sick person has a specific role with both rights and responsibilities .   To start with , she has not chosen to be sick and should not be treated as responsible for her condition .   The sick person also has the right of being exempt from normal social roles ; she is not required to fulfill the obligation of a well person and can avoid her normal responsibilities without censure .  However , this exemption is temporary and relative to the severity of the illness . The exemption also requires legitimation by a physician ; that is , a physician must certify that the illness is genuine ."
2,"The class, race, and gender inequalities in our healthcare system support the _____________ perspective.","Sociologists may also understand these issues more fully by considering them through one of the main theoretical perspectives of the discipline . The functionalist perspective is a macroanalytical perspective that looks at the big picture , focusing on the way that all aspects of society are integral to the continued health and viability of the whole . For those working within the functionalist perspective , the focus is on how healthy individuals have the most to contribute to the stability of society . Functionalists might study the most efficient way to restore “ sick ” individuals to a healthy state .  The conflict perspective is another macroanalytical perspective that focuses on the creation and reproduction of inequality .   Someone applying the conflict perspective might focus on inequalities within the health system itself , looking at disparities in race , ethnicity , gender , and age .  Someone applying the interactionist perspective to health might focus on how people understand their health , and how their health affects their relationships with the people in their lives ."
2,The removal of homosexuality from the DSM is an example of ____________.," There are numerous examples of demedicalization in history as well .  During the Civil War era , slaves who frequently ran away from their owners were diagnosed with a mental disorder called drapetomania . This has since been reinterpreted as a completely appropriate response to being enslaved .  A more recent example is homosexuality , which was labeled a mental disorder or a sexual orientation disturbance by the American Psychological Association until 1973 .  According to theorists working in this perspective , health and illness are both socially constructed . As we discussed in the beginning of the chapter , interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes people attribute to illness . The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior .  A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again .  Medicalization and demedicalization affect who responds to the patient , how people respond to the patient , and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient ( Conrad and Schneider 1992 ) . Depending on what definition is used , there is some overlap between mood disorders and personality disorders , which affect nine percent of Americans yearly .  The American Psychological Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders ( DSM ) , and their definition of personality disorders is changing in the fifth edition , which is being revised in 2011 and 2012 .  In the DSM-IV , personality disorders represent “ an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the culture of the individual who exhibits it ” ( National Institute of Mental Health ) . In other words , personality disorders cause people to behave in ways that are seen as abnormal to society but seem normal to them . The DSM-V proposes broadening this definition by offering five broad personality trait domains to describe personality disorders , some related to the level or type of their disconnect with society . As their application evolves , we will see how their definitions help scholars across disciplines understand the intersection of health issues and how they are defined by social institutions and cultural norms ."
3,"Socialization, as a sociological term, describes:"," Socialization helps people learn to function successfully in their social worlds .  How does the process of socialization occur ? How do we learn to use the objects of our society ’ s material culture ?  How do we come to adopt the beliefs , values , and norms that represent its nonmaterial culture ?  This learning takes place through interaction with various agents of socialization , like peer groups and families , plus both formal and informal social institutions .  Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society .   It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to accept society ’ s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values .  Socialization is not the same as socializing ( interacting with others , like family , friends , and coworkers ); to be precise , it is a sociological process that occurs through socializing . As Danielle ’ s story illustrates , even the most basic of human activities are learned . You may be surprised to know that even physical tasks like sitting , standing , and walking had not automatically developed for Danielle as she grew . And without socialization , Danielle hadn ’ t learned about the material culture of her society ( the tangible objects a culture uses ): for example , she couldn ’ t hold a spoon , bounce a ball , or use a chair for sitting . She also hadn ’ t learned its nonmaterial culture , such as its beliefs , values , and norms . She had no understanding of the concept of “ family , ” didn ’ t know cultural expectations for using a bathroom for elimination , and had no sense of modesty . Most importantly , she hadn ’ t learned to use the symbols that make up language — through which we learn about who we are , how we fit with other people , and the natural and social worlds in which we live . Sociologists have long been fascinated by circumstances like Danielle ’ s — in which a child receives sufficient human support to survive , but virtually no social interaction — because they highlight how much we depend on social interaction to provide the information and skills that we need to be part of society or even to develop a “ self . ”"
3,The Harlows’ study on rhesus monkeys showed that:,"The necessity for early social contact was demonstrated by the research of Harry and Margaret Harlow . From 1957 to 1963 , the Harlows conducted a series of experiments studying how rhesus monkeys , which behave a lot like people , are affected by isolation as babies . They studied monkeys raised under two types of “ substitute ” mothering circumstances : a mesh and wire sculpture , or a soft terrycloth “ mother . ” The monkeys systematically preferred the company of a soft , terrycloth substitute mother ( closely resembling a rhesus monkey ) that was unable to feed them , to a mesh and wire mother that provided sustenance via a feeding tube .  This demonstrated that while food was important , social comfort was of greater value ( Harlow and Harlow 1962 ; Harlow 1971 ) .  Later experiments testing more severe isolation revealed that such deprivation of social contact led to significant developmental and social challenges later in life ."
3,What occurs in Lawrence Kohlberg’s conventional level?,"Moral development is an important part of the socialization process . The term refers to the way people learn what society considered to be “ good ” and “ bad , ” which is important for a smoothly functioning society . Moral development prevents people from acting on unchecked urges , instead considering what is right for society and good for others . Lawrence Kohlberg ( 1927 – 1987 ) was interested in how people learn to decide what is right and what is wrong . To understand this topic , he developed a theory of moral development that includes three levels : preconventional , conventional , and postconventional . In the preconventional stage , young children , who lack a higher level of cognitive ability , experience the world around them only through their senses .  It isn ’ t until the teen years that the conventional theory develops , when youngsters become increasingly aware of others ’ feelings and take those into consideration when determining what ’ s “ good ” and “ bad . ” The final stage , called postconventional , is when people begin to think of morality in abstract terms , such as Americans believing that everyone has the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .  At this stage , people also recognize that legality and morality do not always match up evenly ( Kohlberg 1981 ) . When hundreds of thousands of Egyptians turned out in 2011 to protest government corruption , they were using postconventional morality . They understood that although their government was legal , it was not morally correct .  Finally , children develop , understand , and learn the idea of the generalized other , the common behavioral expectations of general society .   By this stage of development , an individual is able to imagine how he or she is viewed by one or many others — and thus , from a sociological perspective , to have a “ self ” ( Mead 1934 ; Mead 1964 ) .  Kohlberg ’ s Theory of Moral Development"
3,What did Carol Gilligan believe earlier researchers into morality had overlooked?," Another sociologist , Carol Gilligan ( 1936 – ) , recognized that Kohlberg ’ s theory might show gender bias since his research was only conducted on male subjects .  Would females study subjects have responded differently ? Would a female social scientist notice different patterns when analyzing the research ? To answer the first question , she set out to study differences between how boys and girls developed morality . Gilligan ’ s research demonstrated that boys and girls do , in fact , have different understandings of morality . Boys tend to have a justice perspective , placing emphasis on rules and laws . Girls , on the other hand , have a care and responsibility perspective ; they consider people ’ s reasons behind behavior that seems morally wrong ."
3,What is one way to distinguish between psychology and sociology?," As a general difference , we might say that while both disciplines are interested in human behavior , psychologists are focused on how the mind influences that behavior , while sociologists study the role of society in shaping behavior .   Psychologists are interested in people ’ s mental development and how their minds process their world .   Sociologists are more likely to focus on how different aspects of society contribute to an individual ’ s relationship with his world .   Another way to think of the difference is that psychologists tend to look inward ( mental health , emotional processes ) , while sociologists tend to look outward ( social institutions , cultural norms , interactions with others ) to understand human behavior . "
3,How did nearly complete isolation as a child affect Danielle’s verbal abilities?,"Detective Holste immediately carried Danielle out of the home . She was taken to a hospital for medical treatment and evaluation . Through extensive testing , doctors determined that , although she was severely malnourished , Danielle was able to see , hear , and vocalize normally .  Still , she wouldn ’ t look anyone in the eyes , didn ’ t know how to chew or swallow solid food , didn ’ t cry , didn ’ t respond to stimuli that would typically cause pain , and didn ’ t know how to communicate either with words or simple gestures such as nodding “ yes ” or “ no . ” Likewise , although tests showed she had no chronic diseases or genetic abnormalities , the only way she could stand was with someone holding onto her hands , and she “ walked sideways on her toes , like a crab ” ( DeGregory 2008 ) . "
3,"From a sociological perspective, which factor does not greatly influence a person’s socialization?"," Sociologists recognize that race , social class , religion , and other societal factors play an important role in socialization .  For example , poor families usually emphasize obedience and conformity when raising their children , while wealthy families emphasize judgment and creativity ( National Opinion Research Center 2008 ) . This may be because working-class parents have less education and more repetitive-task jobs for which the ability to follow rules and to conform helps . Wealthy parents tend to have better educations and often work in managerial positions or in careers that require creative problem solving , so they teach their children behaviors that would be beneficial in these positions . This means that children are effectively socialized and raised to take the types of jobs that their parents already have , thus reproducing the class system ( Kohn 1977 ) . Likewise , children are socialized to abide by gender norms , perceptions of race , and class-related behaviors . Though genetics and hormones play an important role in human behavior , sociology ’ s larger concern is the effect that society has on human behavior , the “ nurture ” side of the nature versus nurture debate .  What race were the twins ?   From what social class were their parents ?   What about gender ?  Religion ? All of these factors affect the lives of the twins as much as their genetic makeup and are critical to consider as we look at life through the sociological lens ."
3,Chris Langan’s story illustrates that:,"What does this have to do with Chris Langan , deemed by some as the smartest man in the world ( Brabham 2001 ) ? Chris was born in severe poverty , moving across the country with an abusive and alcoholic stepfather . Chris ’ s genius went greatly unnoticed . After accepting a full scholarship to Reed College , his funding was revoked after his mother failed to fill out necessary paperwork . Unable to successfully make his case to the administration , Chris , who had received straight A ’ s the previous semester , was given F ’ s on his transcript and forced to drop out . After enrolling in Montana State , an administrator ’ s refusal to rearrange his class schedule left him unable to find the means necessary to travel the 16 miles to attend classes .  What Chris had in brilliance , he lacked practical intelligence , or what psychologist Robert Sternberg defines as “ knowing what to say to whom , knowing when to say it , and knowing how to say it for maximum effect ” ( Sternberg et al .  2000 ) .  Such knowledge was never part of his socialization .  The Life of Chris Langan , the Smartest Man You ’ ve Never Heard Of Bouncer . Firefighter . Factory worker . Cowboy . Chris Langan spent the majority of his adult life just getting by with jobs like these . He had no college degree , few resources , and a past filled with much disappointment .  Chris Langan also had an IQ of over 195 , nearly 100 points higher than the average person ( Brabham 2001 ) .  So why didn ’ t Chris become a neurosurgeon , professor , or aeronautical engineer ?  According to Macolm Gladwell ( 2008 ) in his book Outliers : The Story of Success , Chris didn ’ t possess the set of social skills necessary to succeed on such a high level — skills that aren ’ t innate , but learned . "
3,Why are wealthy parents more likely than poor parents to socialize their children toward creativity and problem solving?,"Sociologists recognize that race , social class , religion , and other societal factors play an important role in socialization . For example , poor families usually emphasize obedience and conformity when raising their children , while wealthy families emphasize judgment and creativity ( National Opinion Research Center 2008 ) . This may be because working-class parents have less education and more repetitive-task jobs for which the ability to follow rules and to conform helps .

Likewise , children are socialized to abide by gender norms , perceptions of race , and class-related behaviors ."
3,How do schools prepare children to one day enter the workforce?,"For example , in the United States , schools have built a sense of competition into the way grades are awarded and the way teachers evaluate students ( Bowles and Gintis 1976 ) . When children participate in a relay race or a math contest , they learn that there are winners and losers in society .  When children are required to work together on a project , they practice teamwork with other people in cooperative situations .   The hidden curriculum prepares children for the adult world .  Children learn how to deal with bureaucracy , rules , expectations , waiting their turn , and sitting still for hours during the day . Schools in different cultures socialize children differently in order to prepare them to function well in those cultures . The latent functions of teamwork and dealing with bureaucracy are features of American culture .  Most American children spend about seven hours a day , 180 days a year , in school , which makes it hard to deny the importance school has on their socialization ( U . S . Department of Education 2004 ) .   Students are not only in school to study math , reading , science , and other subjects — the manifest function of this system .  Schools also serve a latent function in society by socializing children into behaviors like teamwork , following a schedule , and using textbooks ."
3,Which one of the following is not a way people are socialized by religion?,"While some religions may tend toward being an informal institution , this section focuses on practices related to formal institutions . Religion is an important avenue of socialization for many people .  The United States is full of synagogues , temples , churches , mosques , and similar religious communities where people gather to worship and learn .   Like other institutions , these places teach participants how to interact with the religion ’ s material culture ( like a mezuzah , a prayer rug , or a communion wafer ) .   For some people , important ceremonies related to family structure — like marriage and birth — are connected to religious celebrations .  Many of these institutions uphold gender norms and contribute to their enforcement through socialization . From ceremonial rites of passage that reinforce the family unit , to power dynamics which reinforce gender roles , religion fosters a shared set of socialized values that are passed on through society ."
3,Which of the following is a manifest function of schools?,"Most American children spend about seven hours a day , 180 days a year , in school , which makes it hard to deny the importance school has on their socialization ( U .

Schools also serve a latent function in society by socializing children into behaviors like teamwork , following a schedule , and using textbooks ."
3,Which of the following is typically the earliest agent of socialization?," Family is the first agent of socialization .  Mothers and fathers , siblings and grandparents , plus members of an extended family , all teach a child what he or she needs to know . For example , they show the child how to use objects ( such as clothes , computers , eating utensils , books , bikes ); how to relate to others ( some as “ family , ” others as “ friends , ” still others as “ strangers ” or “ teachers ” or “ neighbors ” ); and how the world works ( what is “ real ” and what is “ imagined ” ) . As you are aware , either from your own experience as a child or your role in helping to raise one , socialization involves teaching and learning about an unending array of objects and ideas ."
3,Which of the following is not an age-related transition point when Americans must be socialized to new roles?,"Socialization isn ’ t a one-time or even a short-term event . We aren ’ t “ stamped ” by some socialization machine as we move along a conveyor belt and thereby socialized once and for all . In fact , socialization is a lifelong process . In the United States , socialization throughout the life course is determined greatly by age norms and “ time-related rules and regulations ” ( Setterson 2002 ) .  As we grow older , we encounter age-related transition points that require socialization into a new role , such as becoming school age , entering the workforce , or retiring .  For example , the U . S . government mandates that all children attend school . Child labor laws , enacted in the early 20th century , nationally declared that childhood be a time of learning , not of labor . In countries such as Niger and Sierra Leone , however , child labor remains common and socially acceptable , with little legislation to regulate such practices ( UNICEF 2011 ) .  Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society .   It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations , to accept society ’ s beliefs , and to be aware of societal values .  Socialization is not the same as socializing ( interacting with others , like family , friends , and coworkers ); to be precise , it is a sociological process that occurs through socializing .

3,Which of the following is true regarding American socialization of recent high school graduates?,"Educational expectations vary not only from culture to culture , but from class to class .  While middle or upper class families may expect their daughter or son to attend a four-year university after graduating from high school , other families may expect their child to immediately begin working full-time , as many within their family have done before . "
4,"As a field, social psychology focuses on ________ in predicting human behavior.","As you ’ ve learned , social psychology is the study of how people affect one another ’ s thoughts , feelings , and behaviors . We have discussed situational perspectives and social psychology ’ s emphasis on the ways in which a person ’ s environment , including culture and other social influences , affect behavior .  In this section , we examine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including social roles , social norms , and scripts .  We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source of information , or cues , on how to behave . Situational influences on our behavior have important consequences , such as whether we will help a stranger in an emergency or how we would behave in an unfamiliar environment ."
4,Making internal attributions for your successes and making external attributions for your failures is an example of ________.," Following an outcome , self-serving bias are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in favorable light ( for example , making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures ) .  When you do well at a task , for example acing an exam , it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior ( “ I ’ m smart , ” ) instead of a situational one ( “ The exam was easy , ” ) .  The tendency of an individual to take credit by making dispositional or internal attributions for positive outcomes but situational or external attributions for negative outcomes is known as the self-serving bias ( Miller & Ross , 1975 ) .  This bias serves to protect self-esteem . You can imagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior , they would never be able to take credit and feel good about their accomplishments ."
4,Collectivistic cultures are to ________ as individualistic cultures are to ________.,"Is the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon ? You may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life . Do people in all cultures commit the fundamental attribution error ? Research suggests that they do not . People from an individualistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy , have the greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error .  Individualistic cultures , which tend to be found in western countries such as the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom , promote a focus on the individual .   Therefore , a person ’ s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior .   In contrast , people from a collectivistic culture , that is , a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others , such as family , friends , and community ( Figure 12.4 ) , are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error ( Markus & Kitayama , 1991 ; Triandis , 2001 ) . "
4,"According to the actor-observer bias, we have more information about ________.","Returning to our earlier example , Greg knew that he lost his job , but an observer would not know . So a naïve observer would tend to attribute Greg ’ s hostile behavior to Greg ’ s disposition rather than to the true , situational cause . Why do you think we underestimate the influence of the situation on the behaviors of others ? One reason is that we often don ’ t have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person ’ s behavior . The only information we might have is what is observable . Due to this lack of information we have a tendency to assume the behavior is due to a dispositional , or internal , factor .  When it comes to explaining our own behaviors , however , we have much more information available to us .  If you came home from school or work angry and yelled at your dog or a loved one , what would your explanation be ? You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time — a situational explanation .  The actor-observer bias is the phenomenon of attributing other people ’ s behavior to internal factors ( fundamental attribution error ) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces ( Jones & Nisbett , 1971 ; Nisbett , Caputo , Legant , & Marecek , 1973 ; Choi & Nisbett , 1998 ) .   As actors of behavior , we have more information available to explain our own behavior .  However as observers , we have less information available ; therefore , we tend to default to a dispositionist perspective ."
4,A(n) ________ is a set of group expectations for appropriate thoughts and behaviors of its members.,"As discussed previously , social roles are defined by a culture ’ s shared knowledge of what is expected behavior of an individual in a specific role . This shared knowledge comes from social norms .  A social norm is a group ’ s expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members — how they are supposed to behave and think ( Deutsch & Gerard , 1955 ; Berkowitz , 2004 ) .  How are we expected to act ? What are we expected to talk about ? What are we expected to wear ? In our discussion of social roles we noted that colleges have social norms for students ’ behavior in the role of student and workplaces have social norms for employees ’ behaviors in the role of employee . Social norms are everywhere including in families , gangs , and on social media outlets . What are some social norms on Facebook ?"
4,"On his first day of soccer practice, Jose suits up in a t-shirt, shorts, and cleats and runs out to the field to join his teammates. Jose’s behavior is reflective of ________.","Because of social roles , people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific , familiar settings .  A script is a person ’ s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting ( Schank & Abelson , 1977 ) .  How do you act on the first day of school , when you walk into an elevator , or are at a restaurant ? For example , at a restaurant in the United States , if we want the server ’ s attention , we try to make eye contact . In Brazil , you would make the sound “ psst ” to get the server ’ s attention . You can see the cultural differences in scripts . To an American , saying “ psst ” to a server might seem rude , yet to a Brazilian , trying to make eye contact might not seem an effective strategy .  Scripts are important sources of information to guide behavior in given situations .  Can you imagine being in an unfamiliar situation and not having a script for how to behave ? This could be uncomfortable and confusing . How could you find out about social norms in an unfamiliar culture ?"
4,"When it comes to buying clothes, teenagers often follow social norms; this is likely motivated by ________.","As discussed previously , social roles are defined by a culture ’ s shared knowledge of what is expected behavior of an individual in a specific role .

4,"In the Stanford prison experiment, even the lead researcher succumbed to his role as a prison supervisor. This is an example of the power of ________ influencing behavior."," The Stanford prison experiment demonstrated the power of social roles , norms , and scripts in affecting human behavior .   The guards and prisoners enacted their social roles by engaging in behaviors appropriate to the roles : The guards gave orders and the prisoners followed orders .  Social norms require guards to be authoritarian and prisoners to be submissive . When prisoners rebelled , they violated these social norms , which led to upheaval . The specific acts engaged by the guards and the prisoners derived from scripts . For example , guards degraded the prisoners by forcing them do push-ups and by removing all privacy . Prisoners rebelled by throwing pillows and trashing their cells . Some prisoners became so immersed in their roles that they exhibited symptoms of mental breakdown ; however , according to Zimbardo , none of the participants suffered long term harm ( Alexander , 2001 ) . The prisoners , in turn , began to show signs of severe anxiety and hopelessness — they began tolerating the guards ’ abuse .  Even the Stanford professor who designed the study and was the head researcher , Philip Zimbardo , found himself acting as if the prison was real and his role , as prison supervisor , was real as well .  After only six days , the experiment had to be ended due to the participants ’ deteriorating behavior . Zimbardo explained ,"
4,"Attitudes describe our ________ of people, objects, and ideas.","Social psychologists have documented how the power of the situation can influence our behaviors . Now we turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs .  Attitude is our evaluation of a person , an idea , or an object .  We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies . Typically , attitudes are favorable or unfavorable : positive or negative ( Eagly & Chaiken , 1993 ) . And , they have three components : an affective component ( feelings ) , a behavioral component ( the effect of the attitude on behavior ) , and a cognitive component ( belief and knowledge ) ( Rosenberg & Hovland , 1960 ) ."
4,Cognitive dissonance causes discomfort because it disrupts our sense of ________.,"What is Cognitive Dissonance ? Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteem is a powerful motivator of human behavior ( Tavris & Aronson , 2008 ) . In the United States , members of the predominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who are above average on many desirable traits ( Ehrlinger , Gilovich , & Ross , 2005 ) . Often , our behavior , attitudes , and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self-esteem or positive self-image .  Psychologist Leon Festinger ( 1957 ) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes , behaviors , or cognitions ( thoughts , beliefs , or opinions ) .  Festinger ’ s theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self-perceptions , we experience psychological discomfort ( dissonance ) . For example , if you believe smoking is bad for your health but you continue to smoke , you experience conflict between your belief and behavior ( Figure 12.11 ) . Later research documented that only conflicting cognitions that threaten individuals ’ positive self-image cause dissonance ( Greenwald & Ronis , 1978 ) . Additional research found that dissonance is not only psychologically uncomfortable but also can cause physiological arousal ( Croyle & Cooper , 1983 ) and activate regions of the brain important in emotions and cognitive functioning ( van Veen , Krug , Schooler , & Carter , 2009 ) . When we experience cognitive dissonance , we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically , physically , and mentally uncomfortable . We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions , attitudes , and behaviors in line — that is , making them harmonious . This can be done in different ways , such as :"
4,"In order for the central route to persuasion to be effective, the audience must be ________ and ________."," The central route to persuasion works best when the target of persuasion , or the audience , is analytical and willing to engage in processing of the information .  From an advertiser ’ s perspective , what products would be best sold using the central route to persuasion ? What audience would most likely be influenced to buy the product ? One example is buying a computer . It is likely , for example , that small business owners might be especially influenced by the focus on the computer ’ s quality and features such as processing speed and memory capacity ."
4,Examples of cues used in peripheral route persuasion include all of the following except ________.," The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ) .   Instead of focusing on the facts and a product ’ s quality , the peripheral route relies on association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement .   For example , having a popular athlete advertise athletic shoes is a common method used to encourage young adults to purchase the shoes .   This route to attitude change does not require much effort or information processing .  This method of persuasion may promote positivity toward the message or product , but it typically results in less permanent attitude or behavior change . The audience does not need to be analytical or motivated to process the message . In fact , a peripheral route to persuasion may not even be noticed by the audience , for example in the strategy of product placement . Product placement refers to putting a product with a clear brand name or brand identity in a TV show or movie to promote the product ( Gupta & Lord , 1998 ) . For example , one season of the reality series American Idol prominently showed the panel of judges drinking out of cups that displayed the Coca-Cola logo . What other products would be best sold using the peripheral route to persuasion ? Another example is clothing : A retailer may focus on celebrities that are wearing the same style of clothing ."
4,"In the Asch experiment, participants conformed due to ________ social influence.","In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group . However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .  What type of social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies ?   Since the line judgment task was unambiguous , participants did not need to rely on the group for information .   Instead , participants complied to fit in and avoid ridicule , an instance of normative social influence .   Now that you have learned about the Asch line experiments , why do you think the participants conformed ?  The correct answer to the line segment question was obvious , and it was an easy task .  Researchers have categorized the motivation to conform into two types : normative social influence and informational social influence ( Deutsch & Gerard , 1955 ) . "
4,Under what conditions will informational social influence be more likely?,"An example of informational social influence may be what to do in an emergency situation . Imagine that you are in a movie theater watching a film and what seems to be smoke comes in the theater from under the emergency exit door .  You are not certain that it is smoke — it might be a special effect for the movie , such as a fog machine .   When you are uncertain you will tend to look at the behavior of others in the theater .  If other people show concern and get up to leave , you are likely to do the same . However , if others seem unconcerned , you are likely to stay put and continue watching the movie ( Figure 12.19 ) .  In normative social influence , people conform to the group norm to fit in , to feel good , and to be accepted by the group .   However , with informational social influence , people conform because they believe the group is competent and has the correct information , particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous .  What type of social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies ? Since the line judgment task was unambiguous , participants did not need to rely on the group for information . Instead , participants complied to fit in and avoid ridicule , an instance of normative social influence ."
4,Social loafing occurs when ________.,"Social Loafing Another way in which a group presence can affect our performance is social loafing .  Social loafing is the exertion of less effort by a person working together with a group .   Social loafing occurs when our individual performance cannot be evaluated separately from the group .   Thus , group performance declines on easy tasks ( Karau & Williams , 1993 ) .  Essentially individual group members loaf and let other group members pick up the slack . Because each individual ’ s efforts cannot be evaluated , individuals become less motivated to perform well . For example , consider a group of people cooperating to clean litter from the roadside . Some people will exert a great amount of effort , while others will exert little effort . Yet the entire job gets done , and it may not be obvious who worked hard and who didn ’ t ."
4,"If group members modify their opinions to align with a perceived group consensus, then ________ has occurred.","When in group settings , we are often influenced by the thoughts , feelings , and behaviors around us . Whether it is due to normative or informational social influence , groups have power to influence individuals . Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink .  Groupthink is the modification of the opinions of members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus ( Janis , 1972 ) .  In group situations , the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groups make more extreme decisions than individuals do . Moreover , groupthink can hinder opposing trains of thought . This elimination of diverse opinions contributes to faulty decision by the group ."
4,Prejudice is to ________ as discrimination is to ________.," Feelings may influence treatment of others , leading to discrimination .   Prejudice "
4,Which of the following is not a type of prejudice?," Another form of prejudice is homophobia : prejudice and discrimination of individuals based solely on their sexual orientation .  Like ageism , homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U . S . society that is tolerated by many people ( Herek & McLemore , 2013 ; Nosek , 2005 ) . Negative feelings often result in discrimination , such as the exclusion of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) people from social groups and the avoidance of LGBT neighbors and co-workers . This discrimination also extends to employers deliberately declining to hire qualified LGBT job applicants . Have you experienced or witnessed homophobia ? If so , what stereotypes , prejudiced attitudes , and discrimination were evident ?  Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex .  Typically , sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women , but either sex can show sexism toward their own or their opposite sex . Like racism , sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect . Common forms of sexism in modern society include gender role expectations , such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household . Sexism also includes people ’ s expectations for how members of a gender group should behave . For example , women are expected to be friendly , passive , and nurturing , and when women behave in an unfriendly , assertive , or neglectful manner they often are disliked for violating their gender role ( Rudman , 1998 ) . Research by Laurie Rudman ( 1998 ) finds that when female job applicants self-promote , they are likely to be viewed as competent , but they may be disliked and are less likely to be hired because they violated gender expectations for modesty . Sexism can exist on a societal level such as in hiring , employment opportunities , and education . Women are less likely to be hired or promoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering , aviation , and construction ( Figure 12.23 ) ( Blau , Ferber , & Winkler , 2010 ; Ceci & Williams , 2011 ) . Have you ever experienced or witnessed sexism ? Think about your family members ’ jobs or careers . Why do you think there are differences in the jobs women and men have , such as more women nurses but more male surgeons ( Betz , 2008 ) ?"
4,________ occurs when the out-group is blamed for the in-group’s frustration.,"One function of prejudice is to help us feel good about ourselves and maintain a positive self-concept . This need to feel good about ourselves extends to our in-groups : We want to feel good and protect our in-groups . We seek to resolve threats individually and at the in-group level . This often happens by blaming an out-group for the problem .  Scapegoating is the act of blaming an out-group when the in-group experiences frustration or is blocked from obtaining a goal ( Allport , 1954 ) .  12.6 Aggression Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
4,When we seek out information that supports our stereotypes we are engaged in ________.,"Have you ever fallen prey to the self-fulfilling prophecy or confirmation bias , either as the source or target of such bias ?  How might we stop the cycle of the self-fulfilling prophecy ?   Social class stereotypes of individuals tend to arise when information about the individual is ambiguous .   If information is unambiguous , stereotypes do not tend to arise ( Baron et al . , 1995 ) .  Another dynamic that can reinforce stereotypes is confirmation bias . When interacting with the target of our prejudice , we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our stereotypic expectations and ignore information that is inconsistent with our expectations .  In this process , known as confirmation bias , we seek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent with our stereotypes ( Wason & Johnson-Laird , 1972 ) .  In the job interview example , the employer may not have noticed that the job applicant was friendly and engaging , and that he provided competent responses to the interview questions in the beginning of the interview . Instead , the employer focused on the job applicant ’ s performance in the later part of the interview , after the applicant changed his demeanor and behavior to match the interviewer ’ s negative treatment ."
4,"Typically, bullying from boys is to ________ as bullying from girls is to ________.","Bullying A modern form of aggression is bullying . As you learn in your study of child development , socializing and playing with other children is beneficial for children ’ s psychological development . However , as you may have experienced as a child , not all play behavior has positive outcomes . Some children are aggressive and want to play roughly . Other children are selfish and do not want to share toys . One form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is bullying . Bullying is repeated negative treatment of another person , often an adolescent , over time ( Olweus , 1993 ) . A one-time incident in which one child hits another child on the playground would not be considered bullying : Bullying is repeated behavior . The negative treatment typical in bullying is the attempt to inflict harm , injury , or humiliation , and bullying can include physical or verbal attacks . However , bullying doesn ’ t have to be physical or verbal , it can be psychological . Research finds gender differences in how girls and boys bully others ( American Psychological Association , 2010 ; Olweus , 1993 ) .  Boys tend to engage in direct , physical aggression such as physically harming others .   Girls tend to engage in indirect , social forms of aggression such as spreading rumors , ignoring , or socially isolating others .  Based on what you have learned about child development and social roles , why do you think boys and girls display different types of bullying behavior ?"
4,Which of the following adolescents is least likely to be targeted for bullying?," Children who are different from others are likely to be targeted for bullying .   Children who are overweight , cognitively impaired , or racially or ethnically different from their peer group may be at higher risk .   Children who are emotionally reactive are at a greater risk for being bullied .  Bullies may be attracted to children who get upset easily because the bully can quickly get an emotional reaction from them ."
4,The bystander effect likely occurs due to ________.,"Based on this case , researchers Latané and Darley ( 1968 ) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect .  The bystander effect is a phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress .  Instead , they just watch what is happening . Social psychologists hold that we make these decisions based on the social situation , not our own personality variables . Why do you think the bystanders didn ’ t help Genovese ? What are the benefits to helping her ? What are the risks ? It is very likely you listed more costs than benefits to helping . In this situation , bystanders likely feared for their own lives — if they went to her aid the attacker might harm them . However , how difficult would it have been to make a phone call to the police from the safety of their apartments ? Why do you think no one helped in any way ? Social psychologists claim that diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation .  Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group ( Bandura , 1999 ) .  Because there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese , as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in the building , individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police . The responsibility to call the police was diffused across the number of witnesses to the crime . Have you ever passed an accident on the freeway and assumed that a victim or certainly another motorist has already reported the accident ? In general , the greater the number of bystanders , the less likely any one person will help . 12.7 Prosocial Behavior Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
4,Altruism is a form of prosocial behavior that is motivated by ________.,"Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy . Empathy is the capacity to understand another person ’ s perspective , to feel what he or she feels . An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others and feels compelled to help ( Batson , 1991 ) .  Other researchers argue that altruism is a form of selfless helping that is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself .  Certainly , after helping , people feel good about themselves , but some researchers argue that this is a consequence of altruism , not a cause . Other researchers argue that helping is always self-serving because our egos are involved , and we receive benefits from helping ( Cialdini , Brown , Lewis , Luce , & Neuberg 1997 ) . It is challenging to determine experimentally the true motivation for helping , whether is it largely self-serving ( egoism ) or selfless ( altruism ) . Thus , a debate on whether pure altruism exists continues . Link to Learning Do you voluntarily help others ? Voluntary behavior with the intent to help other people is called prosocial behavior . Why do people help other people ? Is personal benefit such as feeling good about oneself the only reason people help one another ? Research suggests there are many other reasons .  Altruism is people ’ s desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping .  In fact , people acting in altruistic ways may disregard the personal costs associated with helping ( Figure 12.27 ) . For example , news accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York reported an employee in the first tower helped his co-workers make it to the exit stairwell . After helping a co-worker to safety he went back in the burning building to help additional co-workers . In this case the costs of helping were great , and the hero lost his life in the destruction ( Stewart , 2002 ) ."
4,"After moving to a new apartment building, research suggests that Sam will be most likely to become friends with ________.","What do you think is the single most influential factor in determining with whom you become friends and whom you form romantic relationships ? You might be surprised to learn that the answer is simple : the people with whom you have the most contact . This most important factor is proximity . You are more likely to be friends with people you have regular contact with .  For example , there are decades of research that shows that you are more likely to become friends with people who live in your dorm , your apartment building , or your immediate neighborhood than with people who live farther away ( Festinger , Schachler , & Back , 1950 ) .  It is simply easier to form relationships with people you see often because you have the opportunity to get to know them ."
4,What trait do both men and women tend to look for in a romantic partner?," Researchers have documented several characteristics in men and women that humans find attractive .  First we look for friends and lovers who are physically attractive . People differ in what they consider attractive , and attractiveness is culturally influenced . Research , however , suggests that some universally attractive features in women include large eyes , high cheekbones , a narrow jaw line , a slender build ( Buss , 1989 ) , and a lower waist-to-hip ratio ( Singh , 1993 ) . For men , attractive traits include being tall , having broad shoulders , and a narrow waist ( Buss , 1989 ) . Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered more attractive than asymmetric individuals ( Fink , Neave , Manning , & Grammer , 2006 ; Penton-Voak et al . , 2001 ; Rikowski & Grammer , 1999 ) . Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth , affection , and social skills ; in males , the attractive traits include achievement , leadership qualities , and job skills ( Regan & Berscheid , 1997 ) . Although humans want mates who are physically attractive , this does not mean that we look for the most attractive person possible . In fact , this observation has led some to propose what is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as their equal in physical attractiveness and social desirability ( Taylor , Fiore , Mendelsohn , & Cheshire , 2011 ) . For example , you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league . So , even if you had proximity to that person , you likely would not ask them out on a date because you believe you likely would be rejected . People weigh a potential partner ’ s attractiveness against the likelihood of success with that person . If you think you are particularly unattractive ( even if you are not ) , you likely will seek partners that are fairly unattractive ( that is , unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior ) ."
4,"According to the triangular theory of love, what type of love is defined by passion and intimacy but no commitment?","Sternberg ( 1986 ) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love — intimacy , passion , and commitment — which is described as consummate love ( Figure 12.30 ) . However , different aspects of love might be more prevalent at different life stages . Other forms of love include liking , which is defined as having intimacy but no passion or commitment . Infatuation is the presence of passion without intimacy or commitment . Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion . Companionate love , which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships , consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion .  Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy , but no commitment .  Finally , fatuous love is defined by having passion and commitment , but no intimacy , such as a long term sexual love affair . Can you describe other examples of relationships that fit these different types of love ?"
4,"According to social exchange theory, humans want to maximize the ________ and minimize the ________ in relationships.","People are motivated to maximize the benefits of social exchanges , or relationships , and minimize the costs . People prefer to have more benefits than costs , or to have nearly equal costs and benefits , but most people are dissatisfied if their social exchanges create more costs than benefits . Let ’ s discuss an example . If you have ever decided to commit to a romantic relationship , you probably considered the advantages and disadvantages of your decision . What are the benefits of being in a committed romantic relationship ? You may have considered having companionship , intimacy , and passion , but also being comfortable with a person you know well . What are the costs of being in a committed romantic relationship ? You may think that over time boredom from being with only one person may set in ; moreover , it may be expensive to share activities such as attending movies and going to dinner .  However , the benefits of dating your romantic partner presumably outweigh the costs , or you wouldn ’ t continue the relationship . "
5,"Aside from the nervous system, which other organ system develops out of the ectoderm?","To begin , a sperm cell and an egg cell fuse to become a fertilized egg . The fertilized egg cell , or zygote , starts dividing to generate the cells that make up an entire organism . Sixteen days after fertilization , the developing embryo ’ s cells belong to one of three germ layers that give rise to the different tissues in the body . The endoderm , or inner tissue , is responsible for generating the lining tissues of various spaces within the body , such as the mucosae of the digestive and respiratory systems . The mesoderm , or middle tissue , gives rise to most of the muscle and connective tissues .  Finally the ectoderm , or outer tissue , develops into the integumentary system ( the skin ) and the nervous system .  It is probably not difficult to see that the outer tissue of the embryo becomes the outer covering of the body . But how is it responsible for the nervous system ?"
5,Which primary vesicle of the embryonic nervous system does not differentiate into more vesicles at the secondary stage?," The mesencephalon does not differentiate into any finer divisions .   The midbrain is an established region of the brain at the primary vesicle stage of development and remains that way .  The rest of the brain develops around it and constitutes a large percentage of the mass of the brain . Dividing the brain into forebrain , midbrain , and hindbrain is useful in considering its developmental pattern , but the midbrain is a small proportion of the entire brain , relatively speaking ."
5,Which adult structure(s) arises from the diencephalon?,"The brain continues to develop , and the vesicles differentiate further ( see Figure 13.3 b ) . The three primary vesicles become five secondary vesicles . The prosencephalon enlarges into two new vesicles called the telencephalon and the diencephalon . The telecephalon will become the cerebrum .  The diencephalon gives rise to several adult structures ; two that will be important are the thalamus and the hypothalamus .   In the embryonic diencephalon , a structure known as the eye cup develops , which will eventually become the retina , the nervous tissue of the eye called the retina .  This is a rare example of nervous tissue developing as part of the CNS structures in the embryo , but becoming a peripheral structure in the fully formed nervous system ."
5,Which non-nervous tissue develops from the neuroectoderm?," As the embryo develops , a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm , which is the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system .  Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the neuroepithelium , forming a neural plate . The cells then begin to change shape , causing the tissue to buckle and fold inward ( Figure 13.2 ) . A neural groove forms , visible as a line along the dorsal surface of the embryo . The ridge-like edge on either side of the neural groove is referred as the neural fold . As the neural folds come together and converge , the underlying structure forms into a tube just beneath the ectoderm called the neural tube . Cells from the neural folds then separate from the ectoderm to form a cluster of cells referred to as the neural crest , which runs lateral to the neural tube . The neural crest migrates away from the nascent , or embryonic , central nervous system ( CNS ) that will form along the neural groove and develops into several parts of the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , including the enteric nervous tissue .  Many tissues that are not part of the nervous system also arise from the neural crest , such as craniofacial cartilage and bone , and melanocytes . "
5,Which structure is associated with the embryologic development of the peripheral nervous system?,"As the embryo develops , a portion of the ectoderm differentiates into a specialized region of neuroectoderm , which is the precursor for the tissue of the nervous system . Molecular signals induce cells in this region to differentiate into the neuroepithelium , forming a neural plate . The cells then begin to change shape , causing the tissue to buckle and fold inward ( Figure 13.2 ) . A neural groove forms , visible as a line along the dorsal surface of the embryo . The ridge-like edge on either side of the neural groove is referred as the neural fold .

Many tissues that are not part of the nervous system also arise from the neural crest , such as craniofacial cartilage and bone , and melanocytes ."
5,Which lobe of the cerebral cortex is responsible for generating motor commands?," Anterior to the central sulcus is the frontal lobe , which is primarily associated with motor functions .  The precentral gyrus is the primary motor cortex .  Cells from this region of the cerebral cortex are the upper motor neurons that instruct cells in the spinal cord to move skeletal muscles .  Anterior to this region are a few areas that are associated with planned movements . The premotor area is responsible for thinking of a movement to be made . The frontal eye fields are important in eliciting eye movements and in attending to visual stimuli . Broca ’ s area is responsible for the production of language , or controlling movements responsible for speech ; in the vast majority of people , it is located only on the left side . Anterior to these regions is the prefrontal lobe , which serves cognitive functions that can be the basis of personality , short-term memory , and consciousness . The prefrontal lobotomy is an outdated mode of treatment for personality disorders ( psychiatric conditions ) that profoundly affected the personality of the patient ."
5,What region of the diencephalon coordinates homeostasis?," Inferior and slightly anterior to the thalamus is the hypothalamus , the other major region of the diencephalon .   The hypothalamus is a collection of nuclei that are largely involved in regulating homeostasis .  The hypothalamus is the executive region in charge of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system through its regulation of the anterior pituitary gland . Other parts of the hypothalamus are involved in memory and emotion as part of the limbic system ."
5,What level of the brain stem is the major input to the cerebellum?,The word pons comes from the Latin word for bridge . It is visible on the anterior surface of the brain stem as the thick bundle of white matter attached to the cerebellum .  The pons is the main connection between the cerebellum and the brain stem .  The bridge-like white matter is only the anterior surface of the pons ; the gray matter beneath that is a continuation of the tegmentum from the midbrain . Gray matter in the tegmentum region of the pons contains neurons receiving descending input from the forebrain that is sent to the cerebellum .
5,What region of the spinal cord contains motor neurons that direct the movement of skeletal muscles?," Some of the largest neurons of the spinal cord are the multipolar motor neurons in the anterior horn .   The fibers that cause contraction of skeletal muscles are the axons of these neurons .  The motor neuron that causes contraction of the big toe , for example , is located in the sacral spinal cord . The axon that has to reach all the way to the belly of that muscle may be a meter in length . The neuronal cell body that maintains that long fiber must be quite large , possibly several hundred micrometers in diameter , making it one of the largest cells in the body ."
5,Brodmann’s areas map different regions of the ________ to particular functions.,"Different regions of the cerebral cortex can be associated with particular functions , a concept known as localization of function .  In the early 1900s , a German neuroscientist named Korbinian Brodmann performed an extensive study of the microscopic anatomy — the cytoarchitecture — of the cerebral cortex and divided the cortex into 52 separate regions on the basis of the histology of the cortex .   His work resulted in a system of classification known as Brodmann ’ s areas , which is still used today to describe the anatomical distinctions within the cortex ( Figure 13.8 ) .   The results from Brodmann ’ s work on the anatomy align very well with the functional differences within the cortex .  Areas 17 and 18 in the occipital lobe are responsible for primary visual perception . That visual information is complex , so it is processed in the temporal and parietal lobes as well ."
5,"What blood vessel enters the cranium to supply the brain with fresh, oxygenated blood?"," The internal carotid artery enters the cranium through the carotid canal in the temporal bone .  A second set of vessels that supply the CNS are the vertebral arteries , which are protected as they pass through the neck region by the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae . The vertebral arteries enter the cranium through the foramen magnum of the occipital bone . Branches off the left and right vertebral arteries merge into the anterior spinal artery supplying the anterior aspect of the spinal cord , found along the anterior median fissure .  The two vertebral arteries then merge into the basilar artery , which gives rise to branches to the brain stem and cerebellum .  The left and right internal carotid arteries and branches of the basilar artery all become the circle of Willis , a confluence of arteries that can maintain perfusion of the brain even if narrowing or a blockage limits flow through one part ( Figure 13.15 ) .  The major artery carrying recently oxygenated blood away from the heart is the aorta .  The very first branches off the aorta supply the heart with nutrients and oxygen .  The next branches give rise to the common carotid arteries , which further branch into the internal carotid arteries .  The external carotid arteries supply blood to the tissues on the surface of the cranium . The bases of the common carotids contain stretch receptors that immediately respond to the drop in blood pressure upon standing . The orthostatic reflex is a reaction to this change in body position , so that blood pressure is maintained against the increasing effect of gravity ( orthostatic means “ standing up ” ) . Heart rate increases — a reflex of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system — and this raises blood pressure ."
5,Which layer of the meninges surrounds and supports the sinuses that form the route through which blood drains from the CNS?,"There are infoldings of the dura that fit into large crevasses of the brain . Two infoldings go through the midline separations of the cerebrum and cerebellum ; one forms a shelf-like tent between the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and the cerebellum , and the other surrounds the pituitary gland .  The dura also surrounds and supports the venous sinuses .   Like a thick cap covering the brain , the dura mater is a tough outer covering .  The name comes from the Latin for “ tough mother ” to represent its physically protective role .  It encloses the entire CNS and the major blood vessels that enter the cranium and vertebral cavity .  It is directly attached to the inner surface of the bones of the cranium and to the very end of the vertebral cavity ."
5,What type of glial cell is responsible for filtering blood to produce CSF at the choroid plexus?,"The ventricular system opens up to the subarachnoid space from the fourth ventricle . The single median aperture and the pair of lateral apertures connect to the subarachnoid space so that CSF can flow through the ventricles and around the outside of the CNS .  Cerebrospinal fluid is produced within the ventricles by a type of specialized membrane called a choroid plexus .   Ependymal cells ( one of the types of glial cells described in the introduction to the nervous system ) surround blood capillaries and filter the blood to make CSF .  The fluid is a clear solution with a limited amount of the constituents of blood . It is essentially water , small molecules , and electrolytes . Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved into the CSF , as they are in blood , and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue ."
5,Which portion of the ventricular system is found within the diencephalon?,"There are four ventricles within the brain , all of which developed from the original hollow space within the neural tube , the central canal . The first two are named the lateral ventricles and are deep within the cerebrum . These ventricles are connected to the third ventricle by two openings called the interventricular foramina .  The third ventricle is the space between the left and right sides of the diencephalon , which opens into the cerebral aqueduct that passes through the midbrain .  The aqueduct opens into the fourth ventricle , which is the space between the cerebellum and the pons and upper medulla ( Figure 13.18 ) ."
5,What condition causes a stroke?," The common name for a disruption of blood supply to the brain is a stroke .  It is caused by a blockage to an artery in the brain . The blockage is from some type of embolus : a blood clot , a fat embolus , or an air bubble . When the blood cannot travel through the artery , the surrounding tissue that is deprived starves and dies . Strokes will often result in the loss of very specific functions . A stroke in the lateral medulla , for example , can cause a loss in the ability to swallow . Sometimes , seemingly unrelated functions will be lost because they are dependent on structures in the same region . Along with the swallowing in the previous example , a stroke in that region could affect sensory functions from the face or extremities because important white matter pathways also pass through the lateral medulla . Loss of blood flow to specific regions of the cortex can lead to the loss of specific higher functions , from the ability to recognize faces to the ability to move a particular region of the body . Severe or limited memory loss can be the result of a temporal lobe stroke ."
5,What type of ganglion contains neurons that control homeostatic mechanisms of the body?,"The other major category of ganglia are those of the autonomic nervous system , which is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic chain ganglia constitute a row of ganglia along the vertebral column that receive central input from the lateral horn of the thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord . Superior to the chain ganglia are three paravertebral ganglia in the cervical region . Three other autonomic ganglia that are related to the sympathetic chain are the prevertebral ganglia , which are located outside of the chain but have similar functions . They are referred to as prevertebral because they are anterior to the vertebral column .  The neurons of these autonomic ganglia are multipolar in shape , with dendrites radiating out around the cell body where synapses from the spinal cord neurons are made .   The neurons of the chain , paravertebral , and prevertebral ganglia then project to organs in the head and neck , thoracic , abdominal , and pelvic cavities to regulate the sympathetic aspect of homeostatic mechanisms . "
5,Which ganglion is responsible for cutaneous sensations of the face?,"Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses , and students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names . A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet , “ On Old Olympus ’ Towering Tops / A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops , ” in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve . The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming . An exercise to help learn this sort of information is to generate a mnemonic using words that have personal significance . The names of the cranial nerves are listed in Table 13.3 along with a brief description of their function , their source ( sensory ganglion or motor nucleus ) , and their target ( sensory nucleus or skeletal muscle ) . They are listed here with a brief explanation of each nerve ( Figure 13.23 ) . The olfactory nerve and optic nerve are responsible for the sense of smell and vision , respectively . The oculomotor nerve is responsible for eye movements by controlling four of the extraocular muscles . It is also responsible for lifting the upper eyelid when the eyes point up , and for pupillary constriction . The trochlear nerve and the abducens nerve are both responsible for eye movement , but do so by controlling different extraocular muscles .  The trigeminal nerve is responsible for cutaneous sensations of the face and controlling the muscles of mastication .  The facial nerve is responsible for the muscles involved in facial expressions , as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva . The vestibulocochlear nerve is responsible for the senses of hearing and balance . The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for controlling muscles in the oral cavity and upper throat , as well as part of the sense of taste and the production of saliva . The vagus nerve is responsible for contributing to homeostatic control of the organs of the thoracic and upper abdominal cavities . The spinal accessory nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the neck , along with cervical spinal nerves . The hypoglossal nerve is responsible for controlling the muscles of the lower throat and tongue ."
5,What is the name for a bundle of axons within a nerve?,"Nerves Bundles of axons in the PNS are referred to as nerves . These structures in the periphery are different than the central counterpart , called a tract . Nerves are composed of more than just nervous tissue . They have connective tissues invested in their structure , as well as blood vessels supplying the tissues with nourishment . The outer surface of a nerve is a surrounding layer of fibrous connective tissue called the epineurium .  Within the nerve , axons are further bundled into fascicles , which are each surrounded by their own layer of fibrous connective tissue called perineurium .  Finally , individual axons are surrounded by loose connective tissue called the endoneurium ( Figure 13.21 ) . These three layers are similar to the connective tissue sheaths for muscles . Nerves are associated with the region of the CNS to which they are connected , either as cranial nerves connected to the brain or spinal nerves connected to the spinal cord ."
5,Which cranial nerve does not control functions in the head and neck?,"Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses , and students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names . A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet , “ On Old Olympus ’ Towering Tops / A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops , ” in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve . The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming .

5,Which of these structures is not under direct control of the peripheral nervous system?,"Terminal ganglia below the head and neck are often incorporated into the wall of the target organ as a plexus . A plexus , in a general sense , is a network of fibers or vessels . This can apply to nervous tissue ( as in this instance ) or structures containing blood vessels ( such as a choroid plexus ) . For example , the enteric plexus is the extensive network of axons and neurons in the wall of the small and large intestines .  The enteric plexus is actually part of the enteric nervous system , along with the gastric plexuses and the esophageal plexus .  Though the enteric nervous system receives input originating from central neurons of the autonomic nervous system , it does not require CNS input to function . In fact , it operates independently to regulate the digestive system ."
6,Employers are required provide a work environment that is safe and healthy for their employees by which law?,"Workers have the right to be safe at work , and companies have responsibilities to employees in the event that they are harmed while undertaking work on behalf of the employer . The Occupational Safety and Health Act , passed in 1970 , is the main legislative action that governs health and safety in the workplace .  The Act established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , which is a federal agency whose role is to “ assure safe and healthy working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training , outreach , education and assistance . ” Private employers and federal government agencies are all covered under OSHA protection , although the self-employed and workers at state and local governments in most states are not covered .  OSHA has adopted thousands of regulations to enforce the Occupational Safety and Health Act . It imposes a number of record-keeping and reporting requirements on private employers . In addition , employers are required to inform employees of their health and safety rights by posting appropriate notices in the workplace ."
6,How many weeks of unpaid leave does the Family Medical Leave Act guarantee to eligible workers?," The Family and Medical Leave Act ( FMLA ) , enacted in 1993 , guarantees all eligible workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12 - month period for family and medical emergencies .  The FMLA applies to all public and private employers with 50 or more employees , covers employees who have worked for the employer for at least one year , and applies to employees who have worked at least 25 hours a week for each of 12 months prior to the leave . The events that qualify workers for leave are :"
6,What regulation protects employees who are terminated from their employment?," Unemployment compensation programs are paid to those who become temporarily unemployed , and are funded by employers through employment taxes .  Workers who quit voluntarily or who are terminated for bad conduct are not eligible for compensation . In addition , in order to qualify for the benefits , applicants must demonstrate that they are available for work ."
6,The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) covers which category?, Overtime pay requirements   Minimum wage provisions   Child labor   The Fair Labor Standards Act ( FLSA ) sets out provisions that delineate fair labor and unfair labor .   There are three main categories covered in the Act : 
6,What is the function of the National Labor Relations Board?, To establish rules interpreting the NLRA   The National Labor Relations Board 
6,_____ is a place of employment where the employee is required to join the union within a specified number of days after being hired.,"In order to try to bolster their power , elected unions often attempt to install a union security agreement . This agreement pertains to the extent to which the union can demand that employees join the union , and whether the employer will be required to collect fees and dues on behalf of the union . A closed shop is a workplace where union membership is a requirement for employment .  A union shop is a place of employment where the employee is required to join the union within a specified number of days after being hired .  An agency shop is a workplace that does not require the employee to join the union , but where agency fees to the union must be paid . Union security agreements are the outcome of collective bargaining agreements ."
6,Which of the following practices are illegal?," Sit-down strikes  Collective bargaining involves the union and the employer negotiating contract terms . The outcome is known as a collective bargaining agreement . The types of terms that are usually negotiated are wages and salaries , hours , and the terms and conditions of employment . If union members dispute working conditions , unfair labor practices , or economic benefits , they have the right to participate in a cessation of work activities , known as a strike . There is a mandatory cooling off period of sixty days before a strike can commence . Some collective bargaining agreements include no-strike clauses .  Although strikes are permitted according to the NRLA , some strikes are illegal : "

6,"To bring a successful claim under the Americans with Disability Act (“ADA”), the plaintiff must prove all of the following except:"," Was otherwise qualified for the position   Suffered an adverse employment decision because of that disability   Has a disability   The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) prevents employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of their physical or mental disabilities .  In addition , employers are required to make reasonable accommodations to known disabilities , as long as such accommodations do not impose an undue burden on the business .  To bring a successful ADA claim , the plaintiff is required to demonstrate that he or she : "
6,The Age Discrimination Act only applies to employers with 20 or more employees.," Passed in 1967 , this Act prohibits employers from making discriminatory employment decisions against people age 40 or older .   This Act applies to all employers with 20 or more employees . "
7,Which statement best expresses the difference between power and authority?," Authority refers to accepted power — that is , power that people agree to follow .   People listen to authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect .  Generally speaking , people perceive the objectives and demands of an authority figure as reasonable and beneficial , or true ."
7,Malcolm X used his public speaking abilities and magnetism to inspire African Americans to stand up against injustice in an extremely hostile environment. He is an example of a(n) __________ leader.," Charismatic leaders tend to hold power for short durations , and according to Weber , they are just as likely to be tyrannical as they are heroic .   Diverse male leaders such as Hitler , Napoleon , Jesus Christ , César Chávez , Malcolm X , and Winston Churchill are all considered charismatic leaders .  Because so few women have held dynamic positions of leadership throughout history , the list of charismatic female leaders is comparatively short . Many historians consider figures such as Joan of Arc , Margaret Thatcher , and Mother Teresa to be charismatic leaders ."
7,Which current world figure has the least amount of political power?,"According to Weber , the power of traditional authority is accepted because that has traditionally been the case ; its legitimacy exists because it has been accepted for a long time .  Britain ’ s Queen Elizabeth , for instance , occupies a position that she inherited based on the traditional rules of succession for the monarchy .  People adhere to traditional authority because they are invested in the past and feel obligated to perpetuate it .  In this type of authority , a ruler typically has no real force to carry out his will or maintain his position but depends primarily on a group ’ s respect . "

7,Many constitutional monarchies started out as:,"In today ’ s global political climate , monarchies far more often take the form of constitutional monarchies , governments of nations that recognize monarchs but require these figures to abide by the laws of a greater constitution .  Many countries that are now constitutional monarchies evolved from governments that were once considered absolute monarchies .  In most cases , constitutional monarchies , such as Great Britain and Canada , feature elected prime ministers whose leadership role is far more involved and significant than that of its titled monarchs . In spite of their limited authority , monarchs endure in such governments because people enjoy their ceremonial significance and the pageantry of their rites ."
7,Which nation is an absolute monarchy?,"A few nations today , however , are run by governments wherein a monarch has absolute or unmitigated power . Such nations are called absolute monarchies .  Although governments and regimes are constantly changing across the global landscape , it is generally safe to say that most modern absolute monarchies are concentrated in the Middle East and Africa .   The small , oil-rich nation of Oman , for instance , is an example of an absolute monarchy .  In this nation , Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said has ruled since the 1970s . Recently , living conditions and opportunities for Oman ’ s citizens have improved , but many citizens who live under the reign of an absolute ruler must contend with oppressive or unfair policies that are installed based on the unchecked whims or political agendas of that leader ."
7,Which of the following present and former government leaders is generally considered a dictator?," Dictators use a variety of means to perpetuate their authority .  Intimidation and brutality are often foremost among their tactics ; individuals are not likely to rebel against a regime if they know they will be hurt . Some dictators also possess the personal appeal that Max Weber identified with a charismatic leader . Subjects of such a dictator may believe that the leader has special ability or authority and may be willing to submit to his or her authority .  Popular images of the late Kim Jong-Il , as well as his successor , Kim Jong-Un , exemplify this type of charismatic dictatorship . "
7,A(n) _________________ is an extremely oppressive government that seeks to control all aspects of its citizens’ lives.,"Many dictatorships do not align themselves strictly with any particular belief system or ideology ; the goal of this type of regime is usually limited to preserving the authority of the dictator at its helm .  The totalitarian dictatorship describes a more ambitious and oppressive style of dictatorship that attempts to control all aspects of its subjects ’ lives .  Communist regimes , for instance , are often totalitarian in nature . They may attempt to regulate how many children citizens bear , what religious beliefs they hold , and so forth . They may also demand that citizens publicly demonstrate their faith in the regime by participating in public marches and demonstrations ."
7,Which is not a characteristic of a democracy?," Democracies , in general , assure certain basic rights to their citizens .   First and foremost , citizens are free to organize political parties and hold elections .   Leaders , once elected , must abide by the terms of the given nation ’ s constitution and are limited in the powers they can exercise , as well as in the length of the duration of their terms .  Most democratic societies also champion freedom of individual speech , the press , and assembly , and they prohibit unlawful imprisonment . Of course , even in a democratic society , the government constrains citizens from total freedom to act however they wish . A democratically elected government does this by passing laws and writing regulations that , at least ideally , reflect the will of the majority of its people ."
7,Which statement best expresses why the United States is not a “true” democracy?," Although the United States champions the democratic ideology , it is not a “ pure ” democracy .   In a purely democratic society , all citizens would vote on all proposed legislation , and this is not how laws are passed in the United States .  There is a practical reason for this : a pure democracy would be hard to implement .  Thus , the United States is a constitution-based federal republic in which citizens elect representatives to make policy decisions on their behalf .  The term representative democracy , which is virtually synonymous with republic , can also be used to describe a government in which citizens elect representatives to promote policies that favor their interests . In the United States , representatives are elected at local and state levels , and the votes of the Electoral College determine who will hold the office of president . Each of the three branches of the United States government — the executive , judicial , and legislative — is held in check by the other branches . 17.3 Politics in the United States"
7,"In the past, Southern states discouraged African Americans from voting by requiring them to take a _____________________ test.","Although recent records have shown more minorities voting now than ever before , this trend is still fairly new . Historically , African Americans and other minorities have been underrepresented at the polls . Black men were not allowed to vote at all until after the Civil War , and black women gained the right to vote along with other women only with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 .  For years , African Americans who were brave enough to vote were discouraged by discriminatory legislation , passed in many southern states , which required poll taxes and literacy tests of prospective voters .  Literacy tests were not outlawed until 1965 , when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act ."

7,Which factor does not influence voting practices?," Like race and ethnicity , social class also has impacted voting practices .  Voting rates among lower-educated , lower-paid workers are less than for people with higher socioeconomic status , fostering a system in which people with more power and access to resources have the means to perpetuate their power . Several explanations have been offered to account for this difference ( Raymond 2010 ) . Workers in low-paying service jobs might find it harder to get to the polls because they lack flexibility in their work hours and quality daycare to look after children while they vote . Because a larger share of racial and ethnic minorities is employed in such positions , social class may be linked to race and ethnicity in influencing voting rates . Attitudes play a role as well . Some people of low socioeconomic status or minority race / ethnicity doubt their vote will count or voice will be heard because they have seen no evidence of their political power in their communities . Many believe that what they already have is all they can achieve ."
7,The U.S. Supreme Court case _________________ led to the revision of voting districts to account for differences in population density.,"The 1960s saw other important reforms in U . S . voting .  Shortly before the Voting Rights Act was passed , the 1964 U . S . Supreme Court case Reynolds v . Sims changed the nature of elections .  This landmark decision reaffirmed the notion of “ one person , one vote , ” a concept holding that each person ’ s vote should be counted equally . Before this decision , unequal distributions of population enabled small groups of people in sparsely populated rural areas to have as much voting power as densely populated urban areas . After Reynolds v . Sims , districts were redrawn so that they would include equal numbers of voters ."

7,Which concept corresponds best to functionalism?," Functionalists view government and politics as a way to enforce norms and regulate conflict .   Functionalists see active social change , such as the sit-in on Wall Street , as undesirable because it forces change and , as a result , undesirable things that might have to be compensated for .   Functionalists seek consensus and order in society .   Dysfunction creates social problems that lead to social change .   For instance , functionalists would see monetary political contributions as a way of keeping people connected to the democratic process .  This would be in opposition to a conflict theorist who would see this financial contribution as a way for the rich to perpetuate their own wealth .  According to functionalism , the government has four main purposes : planning and directing society , meeting social needs , maintaining law and order , and managing international relations .  According to functionalism , all aspects of society serve a purpose ."
7,Which sociologist is not associated with conflict theory?," Other sociologists study government and power by relying on the framework of symbolic interactionism , which is grounded in the works of Max Weber and George H . Mead . "
7,Karl Marx believed social structures evolve out of:," According to sociologist and philosopher Karl Marx , such conflicts are necessary , albeit ugly , steps toward a more egalitarian society .  Marx saw a historical pattern in which revolutionaries toppled elite power structures , after which wealth and authority were more evenly dispersed among the population , and the overall social order advances .  In this pattern of change through conflict , people tend to gain greater personal freedom and economic stability ( 1848 ) .   Philosopher and social scientist Karl Marx was a seminal force in developing the conflict theory perspective .   He was a proponent of conflict , in general , because he felt that it was the only means of promoting positive change for the underprivileged .   Marx did not agree with Durkheim ’ s notions of cooperation and interdependence ; he instead saw society as a stage for exploitation and strife . "
7,"The Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street protests, and the Tea Party movement have the following in common:"," Modern-day life is not without a multitude of political conflicts : discontents in Egypt overthrow dictator Hosni Mubarak , disenchanted American Tea Partiers call for government realignment , and Occupy Wall Street protesters decry corporate greed .   Indeed , the study of any given conflict offers a window of insight into the social structure of its surrounding culture , as well as insight into the larger human condition "
7,Which is not one of functionalism’s four main purposes of government?," According to functionalism , the government has four main purposes : planning and directing society , meeting social needs , maintaining law and order , and managing international relations .  According to functionalism , all aspects of society serve a purpose ."
7,Sociologist G. William Domhoff’s Who Rules America? asserts that wealth is often necessary to exert the most influence over social and political systems. This is a ____ perspective.,"Domhoff ’ s research helped to popularize the concept of the power elite . His theories describe the members of the power elite maintaining their position by collectively following the same social patterns , such as vacationing at a handful of destinations , joining elite clubs , and attending select schools . He also pointed out that the existence of a power elite stands in contrast to an important American ideal : that all Americans have a voice in their government .  Domhoff acknowledges that all Americans can potentially exert political influence , but he asserts that our current social and political systems make it easier for the wealthiest citizens to shape policy .   G . William Domhoff , a contemporary sociologist , is a modern-day proponent of Marx ’ s theories and has written numerous commentaries on the existence of a modern-day power elite in American society .   Domhoff ( 2011 ) has devoted a considerable amount of energy to his effort of pointing out the power elite ’ s influence on policy and society in general .   Philosopher and social scientist Karl Marx was a seminal force in developing the conflict theory perspective .  He was a proponent of conflict , in general , because he felt that it was the only means of promoting positive change for the underprivileged . Marx did not agree with Durkheim ’ s notions of cooperation and interdependence ; he instead saw society as a stage for exploitation and strife ."
7,Which of the following paradigms would consider movements such as Occupy Wall Street undesirable and unnecessarily forcing social change?," Functionalists view government and politics as a way to enforce norms and regulate conflict .

Functionalists seek consensus and order in society . Dysfunction creates social problems that lead to social change .

This would be in opposition to a conflict theorist who would see this financial contribution as a way for the rich to perpetuate their own wealth ."
8,Which group saw an expansion of their voting rights in the early nineteenth century?," Expanded voting rights did not extend to women , Native , or free Black people in the North .   Indeed , race replaced property qualifications as the criterion for voting rights .  American democracy had a decidedly racist orientation ; a White majority limited the rights of Black minorities . New Jersey explicitly restricted the right to vote to White men only . Connecticut passed a law in 1814 taking the right to vote away from free Black men and restricting suffrage to White men only . By the 1820s , 80 percent of the White male population could vote in New York State elections . No other state had expanded suffrage so dramatically . At the same time , however , New York effectively disenfranchised free Black men in 1822 ( Black men had had the right to vote under the 1777 constitution ) by requiring that “ men of color ” must possess property over the value of $ 250 . In the 1820s , American political culture gave way to the democratic urges of the citizenry . Political leaders and parties rose to popularity by championing the will of the people , pushing the country toward a future in which a wider swath of citizens gained a political voice .  However , this expansion of political power was limited to White men ; women , free Black people , and Native Americans remained — or grew increasingly — disenfranchised by the American political system . "
8,What was the lasting impact of the Bucktail Republican Party in New York?," One of the Bucktails ’ greatest achievements in New York came in the form of revisions to the state constitution in the 1820s .   Under the original constitution , a Council of Appointments selected local officials such as sheriffs and county clerks .   The Bucktails replaced this process with a system of direct elections , which meant thousands of jobs immediately became available to candidates who had the support of the majority .  In practice , Van Buren ’ s party could nominate and support their own candidates based on their loyalty to the party . In this way , Van Buren helped create a political machine of disciplined party members who prized loyalty above all else , a harbinger of future patronage politics in the United States . This system of rewarding party loyalists is known as the spoils system ( from the expression , “ To the victor belong the spoils ” ) . Van Buren ’ s political machine helped radically transform New York politics ."
8,Who won the popular vote in the election of 1824?," Results from the eighteen states where the popular vote determined the electoral vote gave Jackson the election , with 152,901 votes to Adams ’ s 114,023 , Clay ’ s 47,217 , and Crawford ’ s 46,979 .  The Electoral College , however , was another matter . Of the 261 electoral votes , Jackson needed 131 or better to win but secured only 99 . Adams won 84 , Crawford 41 , and Clay 37 . Because Jackson did not receive a majority vote from the Electoral College , the election was decided following the terms of the Twelfth Amendment , which stipulated that when a candidate did not receive a majority of electoral votes , the election went to the House of Representatives , where each state would provide one vote . House Speaker Clay did not want to see his rival , Jackson , become president and therefore worked within the House to secure the presidency for Adams , convincing many to cast their vote for the New Englander . Clay ’ s efforts paid off ; despite not having won the popular vote , John Quincy Adams was certified by the House as the next president . Once in office , he elevated Henry Clay to the post of secretary of state .  With the caucus system defunct , the presidential election of 1824 featured five candidates , all of whom ran as Democratic-Republicans ( the Federalists having ceased to be a national political force ) .   The crowded field included John Quincy Adams , the son of the second president , John Adams .  Candidate Adams had broken with the Federalists in the early 1800s and served on various diplomatic missions , including the mission to secure peace with Great Britain in 1814 . He represented New England .  A second candidate , John C . Calhoun from South Carolina , had served as secretary of war and represented the slaveholding South .  He dropped out of the presidential race to run for vice president .  A third candidate , Henry Clay , the Speaker of the House of Representatives , hailed from Kentucky and represented the western states .  He favored an active federal government committed to internal improvements , such as roads and canals , to bolster national economic development and settlement of the West .  William H . Crawford , a slaveholder from Georgia , suffered a stroke in 1823 that left him largely incapacitated , but he ran nonetheless and had the backing of the New York machine headed by Van Buren .   Andrew Jackson , the famed “ hero of New Orleans , ” rounded out the field .  Jackson had very little formal education , but he was popular for his military victories in the War of 1812 and in wars against the Creek and the Seminole . He had been elected to the Senate in 1823 , and his popularity soared as pro-Jackson newspapers sang the praises of the courage and daring of the Tennessee slaveholder ( Figure 10.4 ) ."
8,What was the actual result of Jackson’s policy of “rotation in office”?,"Amid revelations of widespread fraud , including the disclosure that some $ 300,000 was missing from the Treasury Department , Jackson removed almost 50 percent of appointed civil officers , which allowed him to handpick their replacements .  This replacement of appointed federal officials is called rotation in office .   Lucrative posts , such as postmaster and deputy postmaster , went to party loyalists , especially in places where Jackson ’ s support had been weakest , such as New England .  Some Democratic newspaper editors who had supported Jackson during the campaign also gained public jobs ."
8,The election of 1828 brought in the first presidency of which political party?," In November 1828 , Jackson won an overwhelming victory over Adams , capturing 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote .   As in 1800 , when Jefferson had won over the Federalist incumbent John Adams , the presidency passed to a new political party , the Democrats .  The election was the climax of several decades of expanding democracy in the United States and the end of the older politics of deference .  A turning point in American political history occurred in 1828 , which witnessed the election of Andrew Jackson over the incumbent John Quincy Adams .   While democratic practices had been in ascendance since 1800 , the year also saw the further unfolding of a democratic spirit in the United States .   Supporters of Jackson called themselves Democrats or the Democracy , giving birth to the Democratic Party .  Political authority appeared to rest with the majority as never before ."
8,South Carolina threatened to nullify which federal act?," To deal with the crisis , Jackson advocated a reduction in tariff rates .   The Tariff of 1832 , passed in the summer , lowered the rates on some products like imported goods , a move designed to calm southerners .   It did not have the desired effect , however , and Calhoun ’ s nullifiers still claimed their right to override federal law .   In November , South Carolina passed the Ordinance of Nullification , declaring the 1828 and 1832 tariffs null and void in the Palmetto State .  Jackson responded , however , by declaring in the December 1832 Nullification Proclamation that a state did not have the power to void a federal law . With the states and the federal government at an impasse , civil war seemed a real possibility . The next governor of South Carolina , Robert Hayne , called for a force of ten thousand volunteers ( Figure 10.9 ) to defend the state against any federal action . At the same time , South Carolinians who opposed the nullifiers told Jackson that eight thousand men stood ready to defend the Union . Congress passed the Force Bill of 1833 , which gave the federal government the right to use federal troops to ensure compliance with federal law . The crisis — or at least the prospect of armed conflict in South Carolina — was defused by the Compromise Tariff of 1833 , which reduced tariff rates considerably . Nullifiers in South Carolina accepted it , but in a move that demonstrated their inflexibility , they nullified the Force Bill ."
8,How did President Jackson respond to Congress’s re-chartering of the Second Bank of the United States?,"A large part of the allure of mass democracy for politicians was the opportunity to capture the anger and resentment of ordinary Americans against what they saw as the privileges of a few . One of the leading opponents of the bank was Thomas Hart Benton , a senator from Missouri , who declared that the bank served “ to make the rich richer , and the poor poorer . ” The self-important statements of Biddle , who claimed to have more power than President Jackson , helped fuel sentiments like Benton ’ s . In the reelection campaign of 1832 , Jackson ’ s opponents in Congress , including Henry Clay , hoped to use their support of the bank to their advantage .  In January 1832 , they pushed for legislation that would re-charter it , even though its charter was not scheduled to expire until 1836 .   When the bill for re-chartering passed and came to President Jackson , he used his executive authority to veto the measure .  In the 1820s , the national bank moved into a magnificent new building in Philadelphia .  However , despite Congress ’ s approval of the Second Bank of the United States , a great many people continued to view it as tool of the wealthy , an anti-democratic force .  President Jackson was among them ; he had faced economic crises of his own during his days speculating in land , an experience that had made him uneasy about paper money . To Jackson , hard currency — that is , gold or silver — was the far better alternative . The president also personally disliked the bank ’ s director , Nicholas Biddle ."
8,How did most Whites in the United States view Native Americans in the 1820s?,"Catlin routinely painted Native Americans in a supposedly aboriginal state . In Attacking the Grizzly Bear , the hunters do not have rifles and instead rely on spears . Such a portrayal stretches credibility as Native peoples had long been exposed to and adopted European weapons .  Indeed , the painting ’ s depiction of Native people riding horses , which were introduced by the Spanish , makes clear that , as much as Catlin and White viewers wanted to believe in the primitive and savage Native , the reality was otherwise .   Native Americans also made frequent appearances in art .   George Catlin produced many paintings of Native peoples , which he offered as true representations despite routinely emphasizing their supposed "" savage "" nature .  The Cutting Scene , Mandan O-kee-pa Ceremony ( Figure 10.12 ) is one example . Scholars have long questioned the accuracy of this portrayal of a rite of passage among the Mandan people . Accuracy aside , the painting captured the imaginations of White viewers , reinforcing their disgust at the savagery of Native Americans ."
8,The 1830 Indian Removal Act is best understood as ________.," Jackson ’ s anti-Native stance struck a chord with a majority of White citizens , many of whom shared a hatred of non-Whites that spurred Congress to pass the 1830 Indian Removal Act .   The act called for the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from their home in the southeastern United States to land in the West , in present-day Oklahoma .  Jackson declared in December 1830 , “ It gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy of the Government , steadily pursued for nearly thirty years , in relation to the removal of the Native Americans beyond the White settlements is approaching to a happy consummation . Two important tribes have accepted the provision made for their removal at the last session of Congress , and it is believed that their example will induce the remaining tribes also to seek the same obvious advantages . ”  Pro-Jackson newspapers touted the president as a champion of opening land for White settlement and moving native inhabitants beyond the boundaries of “ American civilization . ” In this effort , Jackson reflected majority opinion : most Americans believed Native peoples had no place in the White republic .   Jackson ’ s animosity toward Native Americans ran deep .   He had fought against the Creek in 1813 and against the Seminole in 1817 , and his reputation and popularity rested in large measure on his firm commitment to remove Native residents from states in the South .   The 1830 Indian Removal Act and subsequent displacement of the Creek , Choctaw , Chickasaw , Seminole , and Cherokee tribes of the Southeast fulfilled the vision of a White nation and became one of the identifying characteristics of the Age of Jackson . "
8,The winner of the 1840 election was ________.," The Whigs ’ efforts , combined with their strategy of blaming Democrats for the lingering economic collapse that began with the hard-currency Panic of 1837 , succeeded in carrying the day .   A mass campaign with political rallies and party mobilization had molded a candidate to fit an ideal palatable to a majority of American voters , and in 1840 Harrison won what many consider the first modern election .   In the 1840 presidential campaign , taking their cue from the Democrats who had lionized Jackson ’ s military accomplishments , the Whigs promoted William Henry Harrison as a war hero based on his 1811 military service against the Shawnee chief Tecumseh at the Battle of Tippecanoe .  John Tyler of Virginia ran as the vice presidential candidate , leading the Whigs to trumpet , “ Tippecanoe and Tyler too ! ” as a campaign slogan ."
8,Which of the following did not characterize political changes in the 1830s?,"The presidential election contest of 1840 marked the culmination of the democratic revolution that swept the United States . By this time , the second party system had taken hold , a system whereby the older Federalist and Democratic-Republican Parties had been replaced by the new Democratic and Whig Parties .  Both Whigs and Democrats jockeyed for election victories and commanded the steady loyalty of political partisans .   Large-scale presidential campaign rallies and emotional propaganda became the order of the day .   Voter turnout increased dramatically under the second party system .   Roughly 25 percent of eligible voters had cast ballots in 1828 .   In 1840 , voter participation surged to nearly 80 percent . "
9,Which term refers to an inflammation of the blood vessels?,"Certain infections can cause inflammation in the heart and blood vessels . Inflammation of the endocardium , the inner lining of the heart , is called endocarditis and can result in damage to the heart valves severe enough to require surgical replacement . Inflammation of the pericardium , the sac surrounding the heart , is called pericarditis . The term myocarditis refers to the inflammation of the heart ’ s muscle tissue . Pericarditis and myocarditis can cause fluid to accumulate around the heart , resulting in congestive heart failure .  Inflammation of blood vessels is called vasculitis .  Although somewhat rare , vasculitis can cause blood vessels to become damaged and rupture ; as blood is released , small red or purple spots called petechiae appear on the skin . If the damage of tissues or blood vessels is severe , it can result in reduced blood flow to the surrounding tissues . This condition is called ischemia , and it can be very serious . In severe cases , the affected tissues can die and become necrotic ; these situations may require surgical debridement or amputation ."
9,"Which of the following is located in the interstitial spaces within tissues and releases nutrients, immune factors, and oxygen to those tissues?","The circulatory ( or cardiovascular ) system is a closed network of organs and vessels that moves blood around the body ( Figure 25.2 ) . The primary purposes of the circulatory system are to deliver nutrients , immune factors , and oxygen to tissues and to carry away waste products for elimination . The heart is a four-chambered pump that propels the blood throughout the body . Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium through the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava after returning from the body . The blood next passes through the tricuspid valve to enter the right ventricle . When the heart contracts , the blood from the right ventricle is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs . There , the blood is oxygenated at the alveoli and returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins . The oxygenated blood is received at the left atrium and proceeds through the mitral valve to the left ventricle . When the heart contracts , the oxygenated blood is pumped throughout the body via a series of thick-walled vessels called arteries . The first and largest artery is called the aorta . The arteries sequentially branch and decrease in size ( and are called arterioles ) until they end in a network of smaller vessels called capillaries .  The capillary beds are located in the interstitial spaces within tissues and release nutrients , immune factors , and oxygen to those tissues .  The capillaries connect to a series of vessels called venules , which increase in size to form the vein s . The veins join together into larger vessels as they transfer blood back to the heart . The largest veins , the superior and inferior vena cava , return the blood to the right atrium ."
9,Which of these conditions results in the formation of a bubo?,"Infections in the lymphatic system also trigger an inflammatory response . Inflammation of lymphatic vessels , called lymphangitis , can produce visible red streaks under the skin . Inflammation in the lymph nodes can cause them to swell .  A swollen lymph node is referred to as a bubo , and the condition is referred to as lymphadenitis .  25.2 Bacterial Infections of the Circulatory and Lymphatic Systems"
9,Which of the following is where are most microbes filtered out of the fluids that accumulate in the body tissues?,"The lymphatic system contains two types of lymphoid tissues . The primary lymphoid tissue includes bone marrow and the thymus . Bone marrow contains the hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) that differentiate and mature into the various types of blood cells and lymphocytes ( see Figure 17.12 ) . The secondary lymphoid tissue s include the spleen , lymph nodes , and several areas of diffuse lymphoid tissues underlying epithelial membranes . The spleen , an encapsulated structure , filters blood and captures pathogens and antigens that pass into it ( Figure 25.5 ) . The spleen contains specialized macrophages and dendritic cells that are crucial for antigen presentation , a mechanism critical for activation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes ( see Major Histocompatibility Complexes and Antigen-Presenting Cells ) .  Lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs situated throughout the body .   These structures contain areas called germinal centers that are rich in B and T lymphocytes .   The lymph nodes also contain macrophages and dendritic cells for antigen presentation .   Lymph from nearby tissues enters the lymph node through afferent lymphatic vessels and encounters these lymphocytes as it passes through ; the lymph exits the lymph node through the efferent lymphatic vessels ( Figure 25.5 ) . "
9,Which of the following diseases is caused by a spirochete?," The diagnosis of relapsing fever can be made by observation of spirochetes in blood , using darkfield microscopy ( Figure 25.16 ) .  For louseborne relapsing fever , doxycycline or erythromycin are the first-line antibiotics . For tickborne relapsing fever , tetracycline or erythromycin are the first-line antibiotics ."
9,Which of the following diseases is transmitted by body lice?," The disease epidemic typhus is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii and is transmitted by body lice , Pediculus humanus .  Flying squirrels are animal reservoirs of R . prowazekii in North America and can also be sources of lice capable of transmitting the pathogen . Epidemic typhus is characterized by a high fever and body aches that last for about 2 weeks . A rash develops on the abdomen and chest and radiates to the extremities . Severe cases can result in death from shock or damage to heart and brain tissues . Infected humans are an important reservoir for this bacterium because R . prowazekii is the only Rickettsia that can establish a chronic carrier state in humans ."
9,What disease is most associated with Clostridium perfringens?," α-Toxin and theta ( θ ) toxin are the major virulence factors of C . perfringens implicated in gas gangrene .  α-Toxin is a lipase responsible for breaking down cell membranes ; it also causes the formation of thrombi ( blood clots ) in blood vessels , contributing to the spread of ischemia . θ-Toxin forms pores in the patient ’ s cell membranes , causing cell lysis .  The gas associated with gas gangrene is produced by Clostridium ’ s fermentation of butyric acid , which produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide that are released as the bacteria multiply , forming pockets of gas in tissues ( Figure 25.7 ) . "
9,Which bacterial pathogen causes plague?," The gram-negative bacillus Yersinia pestis causes the zoonotic infection plague .  This bacterium causes acute febrile disease in animals , usually rodents or other small mammals , and humans . The disease is associated with a high mortality rate if left untreated . Historically , Y . pestis has been responsible for several devastating pandemics , resulting in millions of deaths ( see Micro Connections : The History of the Plague ) . There are three forms of plague : bubonic plague ( the most common form , accounting for about 80 % of cases ) , pneumonic plague , and septicemic plague . These forms are differentiated by the mode of transmission and the initial site of infection . Figure 25.9 illustrates these various modes of transmission and infection between animals and humans ."
9,Which of the following viruses is most widespread in the human population?," Human herpesvirus 4 , also known as Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , has been associated with a variety of human diseases , such as mononucleosis and Burkitt lymphoma .   Exposure to the human herpesvirus 4 ( HHV - 4 ) is widespread and nearly all people have been exposed at some time in their childhood , as evidenced by serological tests on populations .  The virus primarily resides within B lymphocyte s and , like all herpes viruses , can remain dormant in a latent state for a long time ."
9,Which of these viruses is spread through mouse urine or feces?," The genus Hantavirus consists of at least four serogroups with nine viruses causing two major clinical ( sometimes overlapping ) syndromes : hantavirus pulmonary syndrome ( HPS ) in North America and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS ) in other continents .   Hantaviruses are found throughout the world in wild rodents that shed the virus in their urine and feces .   Transmission occurs between rodents and to humans through inhalation of aerosols of the rodent urine and feces .  Hantaviruses associated with outbreaks in the US and Canada are transmitted by the deer mouse , white-footed mouse , or cotton rat ."
9,A patient at a clinic has tested positive for HIV. Her blood contained 700/µL CD4 T cells and she does not have any apparent illness. Her infection is in which stage?," Stage 1 : Acute HIV infection .   Two to 4 weeks after infection with HIV , patients may experience a flu-like illness , which can last for a few weeks .   Patients with acute HIV infection have more than 500 cells / μL CD4 T cells and a large amount of virus in their blood .  Patients are very contagious during this stage . To confirm acute infection , either a fourth-generation antibody-antigen test or a nucleic acid test ( NAT ) must be performed ."
9,Which of the following diseases is caused by a helminth?," Disease Profile Common Eukaryotic Pathogens of the Human Circulatory System Protozoan and helminthic infections are prevalent in the developing world .   A few of the more important parasitic infections are summarized in Figure 25.34 .   Schistosomiasis ( bilharzia ) is an NTD caused by blood flukes in the genus Schistosoma that are native to the Caribbean , South America , Middle East , Asia , and Africa .  Most human schistosomiasis cases are caused by Schistosoma mansoni , S . haematobium , or S . japonicum . Schistosoma are the only trematodes that invade through the skin ; all other trematodes infect by ingestion . WHO estimates that at least 258 million people required preventive treatment for schistosomiasis in 2014 . 51 51 World Health Organization . “ Schistosomiasis . Fact Sheet . ” 2016 . http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/en/ . Accessed July 29 , 2016 ."
9,Which of these is the most common form of leishmaniasis?," The three major clinical forms of leishmaniasis are cutaneous ( oriental sore , Delhi boil , Aleppo boil ) , visceral ( kala-azar , Dumdum fever ) , and mucosal ( espundia ) .   The most common form of disease is cutaneous leishmaniasis , which is characterized by the formation of sores at the site of the insect bite that may start out as papules or nodules before becoming large ulcers ( Figure 25.33 ) . "
9,Which of the following is a causative agent of malaria?," Currently , P . falciparum is the most common and most lethal cause of malaria , often called falciparum malaria .   Falciparum malaria is widespread in highly populated regions of Africa and Asia , putting many people at risk for the most severe form of the disease . "
10,"If DNA of a particular species was analyzed and it was found that it contains 27 percent A, what would be the percentage of C?","into the cell and carried information to produce more phage particles , thus providing evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins ( Figure 14.4 ) .  Around this same time , Austrian biochemist Erwin Chargaff examined the content of DNA in different species and found that the amounts of adenine , thymine , guanine , and cytosine were not found in equal quantities , and that it varied from species to species , but not between individuals of the same species .   He found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine , and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine , or A = T and G = C . This is also known as Chargaff ’ s rules .  This finding proved immensely useful when Watson and Crick were getting ready to propose their DNA double helix model . 14.2 DNA Structure and Sequencing Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
10,The experiments by Hershey and Chase helped confirm that DNA was the hereditary material on the basis of the finding that:," Experiments conducted by Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that DNA was the genetic material and not proteins .  Chase and Hershey were studying a bacteriophage , which is a virus that infects bacteria . Viruses typically have a simple structure : a protein coat , called the capsid , and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material , either DNA or RNA . The bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface , and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell . The phage DNA makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery , and eventually the host cell bursts , releasing a large number of bacteriophages .  Hershey and Chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur , 35 S , to label the protein coat .   Another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus , 32 P . Because phosphorous is found in DNA , but not protein , the DNA and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus . "
10,DNA double helix does not have which of the following?," Watson and Crick proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix .   Base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine ; namely , A pairs with T and G pairs with C . Adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs , and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs .  The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds ; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds . The two strands are anti-parallel in nature ; that is , the 3 ' end of one strand faces the 5 ' end of the other strand . The sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure , whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside . Each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm , and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm . Therefore , ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix . The diameter of the DNA double helix is 2 nm , and it is uniform throughout . Only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter . The twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves ( Figure 14.7 ) ."
10,"In eukaryotes, what is the DNA wrapped around?","The essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes . Before replication can start , the DNA has to be made available as template .  Eukaryotic DNA is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes .  The chromatin ( the complex between DNA and proteins ) may undergo some chemical modifications , so that the DNA may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the DNA replication machinery . At the origin of replication , a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins . Other proteins are then recruited to start the replication process ( Table 14.2 ) . Eukaryotes , whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule , employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus ( Figure 14.11 ) .  At the most basic level , DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes .  The histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an octamer . The DNA ( which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups ) is wrapped tightly around the histone core . This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA . This is also known as the “ beads on a string ” structure . This is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber , which is the diameter of the structure . At the metaphase stage , the chromosomes are at their most compact , are approximately 700 nm in width , and are found in association with scaffold proteins ."
10,Meselson and Stahl's experiments proved that DNA replicates by which mode?,"The E . coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14 N and allowed to grow for one generation . The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated . The DNA was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge . Some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14 N and spun again . During the density gradient centrifugation , the DNA is loaded into a gradient ( typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose ) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm . Under these circumstances , the DNA will form a band according to its density in the gradient .  DNA grown in 15 N will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14 N . Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14 N after they had been shifted from 15 N , the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15 N and 14 N . This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication .  The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14 N formed two bands : one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15 N and 14 N , and the other corresponded to the band of 14 N DNA . These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner . Therefore , the other two modes were ruled out ."
10,"If the sequence of the 5'-3' strand is AATGCTAC, then the complementary sequence has the following sequence:","The replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second .  DNA polymerase can only extend in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction , which poses a slight problem at the replication fork .   As we know , the DNA double helix is anti-parallel ; that is , one strand is in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction and the other is oriented in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction .   One strand , which is complementary to the 3 ' to 5 ' parental DNA strand , is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction .  This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand . The other strand , complementary to the 5 ' to 3 ' parental DNA , is extended away from the replication fork , in small fragments known as Okazaki fragments , each requiring a primer to start the synthesis . Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese scientist who first discovered them . The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand ."
10,Which of the following components is not involved during the formation of the replication fork?,"How does the replication machinery know where to begin ? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where replication begins . In E . coli , which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome ( as do most prokaryotes ) , it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in AT sequences .  The origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site .   An enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs .   ATP hydrolysis is required for this process .   As the DNA opens up , Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed .   Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi - directionally as replication proceeds .   Single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of DNA near the replication fork to prevent the single-stranded DNA from winding back into a double helix .  DNA polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5 ' to 3 ' direction ( a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction ) . It also requires a free 3 ' - OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3 ' - OH end and the 5 ' phosphate of the next nucleotide . This essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3 ' - OH group is not available . Then how does it add the first nucleotide ? The problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3 ' - OH end . Another enzyme , RNA primase , synthesizes an RNA primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the DNA . Because this sequence primes the DNA synthesis , it is appropriately called the primer . DNA polymerase can now extend this RNA primer , adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand ( Figure 14.14 ) ."

10,The ends of the linear chromosomes are maintained by,"The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres , which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene . In a way , these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide . In humans , a six base pair sequence , TTAGGG , is repeated 100 to 1000 times .  The discovery of the enzyme telomerase ( Figure 14.16 ) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained .  The telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template . It attaches to the end of the chromosome , and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3 ' end of the DNA strand . Once the 3 ' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated , DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes . Thus , the ends of the chromosomes are replicated ."
10,"During proofreading, which of the following enzymes reads the DNA?"," Most of the mistakes during DNA replication are promptly corrected by DNA polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added ( Figure 14.17 ) .   In proofreading , the DNA pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one , so a correction can be made .  The polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand . If it is the right base , the next nucleotide is added . If an incorrect base has been added , the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide . This is performed by the exonuclease action of DNA pol III . Once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed , a new one will be added again ."

11,Which of the following fictional societies is an example of a pastoral society?,"Pastoral Changing conditions and adaptations led some societies to rely on the domestication of animals where circumstances permitted . Roughly 7,500 years ago , human societies began to recognize their ability to tame and breed animals and to grow and cultivate their own plants .  Pastoral societies rely on the domestication of animals as a resource for survival .  Unlike earlier hunter-gatherers who depended entirely on existing resources to stay alive , pastoral groups were able to breed livestock for food , clothing , and transportation , creating a surplus of goods . Herding , or pastoral , societies remained nomadic because they were forced to follow their animals to fresh feeding grounds . Around the time that pastoral societies emerged , specialized occupations began to develop , and societies commenced trading with local groups ."
11,Which of the following occupations is a person of power most likely to have in an information society?,"Digital technology is the steam engine of information societies , and computer moguls such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are its John D . Rockefellers and Cornelius Vanderbilts .  Since the economy of information societies is driven by knowledge and not material goods , power lies with those in charge of storing and distributing information .  Members of a postindustrial society are likely to be employed as sellers of services — software programmers or business consultants , for example — instead of producers of goods .  Social classes are divided by access to education , since without technical skills , people in an information society lack the means for success .  4.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Society"
11,Which of the following societies were the first to have permanent residents?," These individual pieces of land , known as fiefdoms , were cultivated by the lower class .   In return for maintaining the land , peasants were guaranteed a place to live and protection from outside enemies .  Power was handed down through family lines , with peasant families serving lords for generations and generations . Ultimately , the social and economic system of feudalism would fail , replaced by capitalism and the technological advances of the industrial era .  The ninth century gave rise to feudal societies .   These societies contained a strict hierarchical system of power based around land ownership and protection .  The nobility , known as lords , placed vassals in charge of pieces of land . In return for the resources that the land provided , vassals promised to fight for their lords .  Feudal "
11,Organic solidarity is most likely to exist in which of the following types of societies?," In industrial societies , mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity , social order based around an acceptance of economic and social differences .  In capitalist societies , Durkheim wrote , division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things . Instead of punishing members of a society for failure to assimilate to common values , organic solidarity allows people with differing values to coexist . Laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than revenge ."
11,"According to Marx, the _____ own the means of production in a society."," Additionally , Marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change .   Economically , he saw conflict existing between the owners of the means of production — the bourgeoisie — and the laborers , called the proletariat .  Marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of social revolution . These revolutions or “ class antagonisms ” as he called them , were a result of one class dominating another . Most recently , with the end of feudalism , a new revolutionary class he called the bourgeoisie dominated the proletariat laborers . The bourgeoisie were revolutionary in the sense that they represented a radical change in the structure of society . In Marx ’ s words , “ Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps , into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat ” ( Marx and Engels 1848 ) ."
11,Which of the following best depicts Marx’s concept of alienation from the process of one’s labor?," Alienation from the process of one ’ s labor .   A worker does not control the conditions of her job because she does not own the means of production .  If a person is hired to work in a fast food restaurant , she is expected to make the food the way she is taught . All ingredients must be combined in a particular order and in a particular quantity ; there is no room for creativity or change . An employee at Burger King cannot decide to change the spices used on the fries in the same way that an employee on a Ford assembly line cannot decide to place a car ’ s headlights in a different position . Everything is decided by the bourgeoisie who then dictate orders to the laborers .  Alienation from the product of one ’ s labor .   An industrial worker does not have the opportunity to relate to the product he is laboring on .  Instead of training for years as a watchmaker , an unskilled worker can get a job at a watch factory pressing buttons to seal pieces together . The worker does not care if he is making watches or cars , simply that the job exists .  In the same way , a worker may not even know or care what product he is contributing to .  A worker on a Ford assembly line may spend all day installing windows on car doors without ever seeing the rest of the car . A cannery worker can spend a lifetime cleaning fish without ever knowing what product they are used for ."
11,"The Protestant work ethic is based on the concept of predestination, which states that ________."," John Calvin in particular popularized the Christian concept of predestination , the idea that all events — including salvation — have already been decided by God .  Because followers were never sure whether they had been chosen to enter Heaven or Hell , they looked for signs in their everyday lives . If a person was hard-working and successful , he was likely to be one of the chosen . If a person was lazy or simply indifferent , he was likely to be one of the damned ."
11,The concept of the iron cage was popularized by which of the following sociological thinkers?,"Weber was also unlike his predecessors in that he was more interested in how individuals experienced societal divisions than in the divisions themselves . The symbolic interactionism theory , the third of the three most recognized theories of sociology , is based on Weber ’ s early ideas that emphasize the viewpoint of the individual and how that individual relates to society .  For Weber , the culmination of industrialization , rationalization , and the like results in what he referred to as the iron cage , in which the individual is trapped by institutions and bureaucracy .  This leads to a sense of “ disenchantment of the world , ” a phrase Weber used to describe the final condition of humanity . Indeed a dark prediction , but one that has , at least to some degree , been borne out ( Gerth and Mills 1918 ) . In a rationalized , modern society , we have supermarkets instead of family-owned stores . We have chain restaurants instead of local eateries . Superstores that offer a multitude of merchandise have replaced independent businesses that focused on one product line , such as hardware , groceries , automotive repair , or clothing . Shopping malls offer retail stores , restaurants , fitness centers , even condominiums . This change may be rational , but is it universally desirable ?"
11,Émile Durkheim’s ideas about society can best be described as ________.," Émile Durkheim and Functionalism As a functionalist , Émile Durkheim ’ s ( 1858 – 1917 ) perspective on society stressed the necessary interconnectivity of all of its elements .  To Durkheim , society was greater than the sum of its parts . He asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior , and that studying collective behavior was quite different from studying an individual ’ s actions . Durkheim called the communal beliefs , morals , and attitudes of a society the collective conscience . In his quest to understand what causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways , he wrote , “ If I do not submit to the conventions of society , if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in my class , the ridicule I provoke , the social isolation in which I am kept , produce , although in an attenuated form , the same effects as punishment ” ( Durkheim 1895 ) . Durkheim also believed that social integration , or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups , was a key factor in social life ."
11,"According to Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, society is based on ________.","Another way of looking at this concept is through W . I . Thomas ’ s notable Thomas theorem which states , “ If men define situations as real , they are real in their consequences ” ( Thomas and Thomas 1928 ) .  That is , people ’ s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather than by objective reality .  For example , a teenager who is repeatedly given a label — overachiever , player , bum — might live up to the term even though it initially wasn ’ t a part of his character .  Like Berger and Luckmann ’ s description of habitualization , Thomas states that our moral codes and social norms are created by “ successive definitions of the situation . ” This concept is defined by sociologist Robert K . Merton as a self-fulfilling prophecy .  Merton explains that with a self-fulfilling prophecy , even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon . One example he gives is of a “ bank run . ” Say for some reason , a number of people falsely fear that their bank is soon to be bankrupt . Because of this false notion , people run to their bank and demand all their cash at once . As banks rarely , if ever , have that much money on hand , the bank does indeed run out of money , fulfilling the customers ’ prophecy . Here , reality is constructed by an idea .  In 1966 sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote a book called The Social Construction of Reality .   In it , they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction , which they call habitualization .  Habitualization describes how “ any action that is repeated frequently becomes cast into a pattern , which can then be … performed again in the future in the same manner and with the same economical effort ” ( Berger and Luckmann 1966 ) . Not only do we construct our own society , but we accept it as it is because others have created it before us . Society is , in fact , “ habit . ”"
12,Which of the following was mentioned as a skill to which psychology students would be exposed?," An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons .   Psychology students hone critical thinking skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method .   Critical thinking is the active application of a set of skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information .   The evaluation of information — assessing its reliability and usefulness — is an important skill in a world full of competing “ facts , ” many of which are designed to be misleading .  For example , critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude of skepticism , recognizing internal biases , making use of logical thinking , asking appropriate questions , and making observations . Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of their undergraduate coursework ( American Psychological Association , 2011 ) .  Together , these factors increase students ’ scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they encounter .  In addition to these broad-based skills , psychology students come to understand the complex factors that shape one ’ s behavior . They appreciate the interaction of our biology , our environment , and our experiences in determining who we are and how we will behave . They learn about basic principles that guide how we think and behave , and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across cultural boundaries ( American Psychological Association , 2011 ) ."
12,Psyche is a Greek word meaning ________.," Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’ s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ); in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly .  The word psychology was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished ( Green , 2001 ) . The root ology denotes scientific study of , and psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind . Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable , we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior . The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge . To apply the scientific method , a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation , called a hypothesis , to explain the phenomenon . A hypothesis is not just any explanation ; it should fit into the context of a scientific theory . A scientific theory is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time . A theory is the best understanding that we have of that part of the natural world . Armed with the hypothesis , the researcher then makes observations or , better still , carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis . That test and its results are then published so that others can check the results or build on them . It is necessary that any explanation in science be testable , which means that the phenomenon must be perceivable and measurable . For example , that a bird sings because it is happy is not a testable hypothesis , since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird . We must ask a different question , perhaps about the brain state of the bird , since this can be measured . In general , science deals only with matter and energy , that is , those things that can be measured , and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality . This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited , since thoughts , at least as we experience them , are neither matter nor energy . The scientific method is also a form of empiricism . An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation , including experimentation , rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities ."
12,"Before psychology became a recognized academic discipline, matters of the mind were undertaken by those in ________.","Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century , compared , for example , to human physiology , which dates much earlier . As mentioned , anyone interested in exploring issues related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century .  Two men , working in the 19th century , are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy .  Their names were Wilhelm Wundt and William James . This section will provide an overview of the shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today .  It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline .   Before this time , the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy .  Given that any behavior is , at its roots , biological , some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology . No biological organism exists in isolation , and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others . Therefore , psychology is also a social science ."
12,"In the scientific method, a hypothesis is a(n) ________.","Psyche comes to represent the human soul ’ s triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness ( Bulfinch , 1855 ); in fact , the Greek word psyche means soul , and it is often represented as a butterfly .

12,"Based on your reading, which theorist would have been most likely to agree with this statement: Perceptual phenomena are best understood as a combination of their components."," Max Wertheimer ( 1880 – 1943 ) , Kurt Koffka ( 1886 – 1941 ) , and Wolfgang Köhler ( 1887 – 1967 ) were three German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany .   These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles .   The word Gestalt roughly translates to “ whole ; ” a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts , how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception .  For example , a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments , but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody , rhythm , and harmony . In many ways , this particular perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt ’ s ideas of structuralism ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) ."
12,________ is most well-known for proposing his hierarchy of needs.," Abraham Maslow ( 1908 – 1970 ) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of human needs in motivating behavior ( Figure 1.8 ) .  Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter , a brief overview will be provided here . Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met ( e . g . , food , water , shelter ) , higher-level needs ( e . g . , social needs ) would begin to motivate behavior . According to Maslow , the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization , a process by which we achieve our full potential . Obviously , the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic of the humanistic perspective is evident ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) . Humanistic psychologists rejected , on principle , the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and biological sciences , because it missed the “ whole ” human being . Beginning with Maslow and Rogers , there was an insistence on a humanistic research program . This program has been largely qualitative ( not measurement-based ) , but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology , including research on happiness , self-concept , meditation , and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy ( Friedman , 2008 ) ."
12,"Rogers believed that providing genuineness, empathy, and ________ in the therapeutic environment for his clients was critical to their being able to deal with their problems.","Carl Rogers ( 1902 – 1987 ) was also an American psychologist who , like Maslow , emphasized the potential for good that exists within all people ( Figure 1.9 ) . Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy . Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind , client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session .  Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach : unconditional positive regard , genuineness , and empathy .   Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are , no matter what he or she might say .  Provided these factors , Rogers believed that people were more than capable of dealing with and working through their own issues ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) ."
12,The operant conditioning chamber (aka ________ box) is a device used to study the principles of operant conditioning.," The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior indicator such as a lever or a button .  When the animal pushes the button or lever , the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior ( such as food ) or a punishment ( such as a noise ) or a token conditioner ( such as a light ) that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment . Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades , and its influence can still be felt today ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) . Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation . In addition , it is used in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapy . Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings . Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior . B . F . Skinner ( 1904 – 1990 ) was an American psychologist ( Figure 1.7 ) . Like Watson , Skinner was a behaviorist , and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences . Therefore , Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior .  As a part of his research , Skinner developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through reinforcement and punishment .   This device , known as an operant conditioning chamber ( or more familiarly , a Skinner box ) , has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior ( Thorne & Henley , 2005 ) . "
12,An individual’s consistent pattern of thought and behavior is known as a(n) ________.,"More recently , the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach . Rather than explaining how personality arises , research is focused on identifying personality traits , measuring these traits , and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation .  Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior , and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals .  These five dimensions are known as the “ Big Five ” or the Five Factor model , and include dimensions of conscientiousness , agreeableness , neuroticism , openness , and extraversion ( Figure 1.14 ) . Each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan ( e . g . , Rantanen , Metsäpelto , Feldt , Pulkinnen , and Kokko , 2007 ; Soldz & Vaillant , 1999 ; McCrae & Costa , 2008 ) and is influenced by genetics ( e . g . , Jang , Livesly , and Vernon , 1996 ) .  Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique .  Several individuals ( e . g . , Freud and Maslow ) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology , and the American psychologist Gordon Allport , contributed to early theories of personality . These early theorists attempted to explain how an individual ’ s personality develops from his or her given perspective . For example , Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind were carried out over the lifespan . Specifically , Freud theorized that an individual went through various psychosexual stages of development . According to Freud , adult personality would result from the resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous ( or sexual pleasure-producing ) zones from the oral ( mouth ) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals . Like many of Freud ’ s theories , this particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests ( Person , 1980 ) ."
12,A researcher interested in what factors make an employee best suited for a given job would most likely identify as a(n) ________ psychologist.,"Industrial-Organizational psychology ( I-O psychology ) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological theories , principles , and research findings in industrial and organizational settings .  I-O psychologists are often involved in issues related to personnel management , organizational structure , and workplace environment .   Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency .  In addition to its applied nature , I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings ( Riggio , 2013 ) ."
12,"If someone wanted to become a psychology professor at a 4-year college, then s/he would probably need a ________ degree in psychology.","Often times , schools offer more courses in psychology than their full-time faculty can teach . In these cases , it is not uncommon to bring in an adjunct faculty member or instructor . Adjunct faculty members and instructors usually have an advanced degree in psychology , but they often have primary careers outside of academia and serve in this role as a secondary job .  Alternatively , they may not hold the doctoral degree required by most 4 - year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching .  Furthermore , many 2 - year colleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology . In general , many of the people who pursue careers at these institutions have master ’ s degrees in psychology , although some PhDs make careers at these institutions as well .  Psychologists can work in many different places doing many different things .   In general , anyone wishing to continue a career in psychology at a 4 - year institution of higher education will have to earn a doctoral degree in psychology for some specialties and at least a master ’ s degree for others .   In most areas of psychology , this means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology .   Literally , PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree , but here , philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se .  Rather , philosophy in this context refers to many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and sciences . The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school , but usually , individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation . A dissertation is essentially a long research paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate ’ s doctoral training . In the United States , a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert reviewers before the degree is conferred ( Figure 1.18 ) ."
12,The ________ places less emphasis on research and more emphasis on application of therapeutic skills.,"Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral degree , which is known as a PsyD . A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology .  PsyD programs generally place less emphasis on research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context ( Norcorss & Castle , 2002 ) . "
12,Which of the following degrees would be the minimum required to teach psychology courses in high school?,"As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter , an undergraduate education in psychology is associated with a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive .  It should come as no surprise , then , that individuals earning bachelor ’ s degrees in psychology find themselves in a number of different careers , as shown in Table 1.1 .   Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers , working in sales , working in human resource departments , and teaching in high schools .  The rapidly growing realm of healthcare professions is another field in which an education in psychology is helpful and sometimes required . For example , the Medical College Admission Test ( MCAT ) exam that people must take to be admitted to medical school now includes a section on the psychological foundations of behavior . Often times , schools offer more courses in psychology than their full-time faculty can teach . In these cases , it is not uncommon to bring in an adjunct faculty member or instructor . Adjunct faculty members and instructors usually have an advanced degree in psychology , but they often have primary careers outside of academia and serve in this role as a secondary job . Alternatively , they may not hold the doctoral degree required by most 4 - year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching .  Furthermore , many 2 - year colleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology .   In general , many of the people who pursue careers at these institutions have master ’ s degrees in psychology , although some PhDs make careers at these institutions as well . "
12,One would need at least a(n) ________ degree to serve as a school psychologist.,"While earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process , usually taking between 5 – 6 years of graduate study ( DeAngelis , 2010 ) , there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master ’ s degree in psychology . People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of professional counselors ( Hoffman , 2012 ) .  Relevant master ’ s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking careers as school psychologists ( National Association of School Psychologists , n . d . ) , in some capacities related to sport psychology ( American Psychological Association , 2014 ) , or as consultants in various industrial settings ( Landers , 2011 , June 14 ) .  Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers such as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing , where assessments and therapy may be a part of the job ."
13,What is the largest difference between the Functionalist and Conflict perspectives and the Interactionist perspective?," The Conflict perspective is another macroanalytical view , one that focuses on the genesis and growth of inequality .  A conflict theorist studying the Occupy movement might look at how business interests have manipulated the system over the last 30 years , leading to the gross inequality we see today . Or this perspective might explore how the massive redistribution of wealth from the middle class to the upper class could lead to a two-class system reminiscent of Marxist ideas .  A third perspective is the Symbolic Interaction or Interactionist perspective .   This method of analyzing groups takes a micro-level view .  Instead of studying the big picture , these researchers look at the day-to-day interactions of groups . Studying these details , the Interactionist looks at issues like leadership style and group dynamics . In the case of the Occupy Movement , Interactionists might ask , “ How does the group dynamic in New York differ from that in Atlanta ? ” Or , “ What dictates who becomes the de facto leader in different cities — geography , social dynamics , economic circumstances ? ”  The Functionalist perspective is a big-picture macro-level view that looks at how different aspects of society are intertwined .  This perspective is based on the idea that society is a well-balanced system with all parts necessary to the whole , and it studies the roles these parts play in relation to the whole . In the case of the Occupy Movement , a Functionalist might look at what macro-level needs the movement serves . For example , a Structural Functionalist might ask how the Occupy Wall Street movement forces both haves and have-nots to pay attention to the economy , or the way urbanites are impacted by the influx of protestors who typically reside outside of their region ."
13,What role do secondary groups play in society?,"Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864 – 1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) . According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives . The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face-to-face in long-term emotional ways . This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones . The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization . The best example of a primary group is the family .  Secondary groups are often larger and impersonal .   They may also be task-focused and time-limited .   These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal - or task-oriented than emotional .  A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group . Neither primary nor secondary groups are bound by strict definitions or set limits . In fact , people can move from one group to another . A graduate seminar , for example , can start as a secondary group focused on the class at hand , but as the students work together throughout their program , they may find common interests and strong ties that transform them into a primary group ."
13,"When a high school student gets teased by her basketball team for receiving an academic award, she is dealing with competing ______________.","Sociology in the Real World College : A World of In-Groups , Out-Groups , and Reference Groups For a student entering college , the sociological study of groups takes on an immediate and practical meaning . After all , when we arrive someplace new , most of us glance around to see how well we fit in or stand out in the ways we want .  This is a natural response to a reference group , and on a large campus , there can be many competing groups .   Say you are a strong athlete who wants to play intramural sports , but your favorite musicians are a local punk band .   You may find yourself engaged with two very different reference groups . "
13,Which of the following is NOT an example of an in-group?,"One of the ways that groups can be powerful is through inclusion , and its inverse , exclusion . In-groups and out-groups are subcategories of primary and secondary groups that help identify this dynamic . Primary groups consist of both in-groups and out-groups , as do secondary groups . The feeling that one belongs in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way . Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840 – 1910 ) developed the concepts of in-group and out-group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) .  In short , an in-group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is .  An out-group , conversely , is a group someone doesn ’ t belong to ; often there may be a feeling of disdain or competition in relation to an out-group .  Sports teams , unions , and sororities are examples of in-groups and out-groups ; people may belong to , or be an outsider to , any of these .   While these affiliations can be neutral or even positive , such as the case of a team sport competition , the concept of in-groups and out-groups can also explain some negative human behavior , such as white supremacist movements like the Ku Klux Klan , or the bullying of gay or lesbian students .   By defining others as “ not like us ” and inferior , in-groups can end up practicing ethnocentrism , racism , sexism , ageism , and heterosexism — manners of judging others negatively based on their culture , race , sex , age , or sexuality .  Often , in-groups can form within a secondary group . For instance , a workplace can have cliques of people , from senior executives who play golf together , to engineers who write code together , to young singles who socialize after hours . While these in-groups might show favoritism and affinity for other in-group members , the overall organization may be unable or unwilling to acknowledge it . Therefore , it pays to be wary of the politics of in-groups , since members may exclude others as a form of gaining status within the group ."
13,"What is a group whose values, norms, and beliefs come to serve as a standard for one's own behavior?","We all like to fit in to some degree . Likewise , when we want to stand out , we want to choose how we stand out and for what reasons . For example , a woman who loves cutting-edge fashion and wants to dress in thought-provoking new styles likely wants to be noticed , but most likely she will want to be noticed within a framework of high fashion . She wouldn ’ t want people to think she was too poor to find proper clothes . Conformity is the extent to which an individual complies with group norms or expectations .  As you might recall , we use reference groups to assess and understand how to act , to dress , and to behave .  Not surprisingly , young people are particularly aware of who conforms and who does not . A high school boy whose mother makes him wear ironed button-down shirts might protest that he will look stupid – – that everyone else wears T-shirts . Another high school boy might like wearing those shirts as a way of standing out . How much do you enjoy being noticed ? Do you consciously prefer to conform to group norms so as not to be singled out ? Are there people in your class who immediately come to mind when you think about those who don ’ t want to conform ? Some other examples of reference groups can be an individual ’ s church , synagogue , or mosque ; one ’ s cultural center ; workplace ; family gathering ; and even one ’ s parents . Often , reference groups convey competing messages . For instance , on television and in movies , young adults often have wonderful apartments , cars , and lively social lives despite not holding a job . In music videos , young women might dance and sing in a sexually aggressive way that suggests experience beyond their years .  At all ages , we use reference groups to help guide our behavior and show us social norms .  So how important is it to surround yourself with positive reference groups ? You may never meet or know a reference group , but it still impacts and influences how you act . Identifying reference groups can help you understand the source of the social identities you aspire to or want to distance yourself from .  A reference group is a group that people compare themselves to — it provides a standard of measurement .  In American society , peer groups are common reference groups . Kids and adults pay attention to what their peers wear , what music they like , what they do with their free time — and they compare themselves to what they see . Most people have more than one reference group , so a middle school boy might not just look at his classmates but also at his older brother ’ s friends and see a different set of norms . And he might observe the antics of his favorite athletes for yet another set of behaviors ."

Big Picture Bullying and Cyberbullying : How Technology Has Changed the Game Most of us know that the old rhyme “ sticks and stones may break my bones , but words will never hurt me ” is inaccurate . Words can hurt , and never is that more apparent than in instances of bullying . Bullying has always existed , often reaching extreme levels of cruelty in children and young adults .  People at these stages of life are especially vulnerable to others ’ opinions of them , and they ’ re deeply invested in their peer groups .  Today , technology has ushered in a new era of this dynamic . Cyberbullying is the use of interactive media by one person to torment another , and it is on the rise . Cyberbullying can mean sending threatening texts , harassing someone in a public forum ( such as Facebook ) , hacking someone ’ s account and pretending to be him or her , posting embarrassing images online , and so on . A study by the Cyberbullying Research Center found that 20 percent of middle school students admitted to “ seriously thinking about committing suicide ” as a result of online bullying ( Hinduja and Patchin 2010 ) . Whereas bullying face-to-face requires willingness to interact with your victim , cyberbullying allows bullies to harass others from the privacy of their homes without witnessing the damage firsthand . This form of bullying is particularly dangerous because it ’ s widely accessible and therefore easier to accomplish . One of the ways that groups can be powerful is through inclusion , and its inverse , exclusion . In-groups and out-groups are subcategories of primary and secondary groups that help identify this dynamic . Primary groups consist of both in-groups and out-groups , as do secondary groups . The feeling that one belongs in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way . Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840 – 1910 ) developed the concepts of in-group and out-group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) . In short , an in-group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is . An out-group , conversely , is a group someone doesn ’ t belong to ; often there may be a feeling of disdain or competition in relation to an out-group . Sports teams , unions , and sororities are examples of in-groups and out-groups ; people may belong to , or be an outsider to , any of these .  While these affiliations can be neutral or even positive , such as the case of a team sport competition , the concept of in-groups and out-groups can also explain some negative human behavior , such as white supremacist movements like the Ku Klux Klan , or the bullying of gay or lesbian students .   By defining others as “ not like us ” and inferior , in-groups can end up practicing ethnocentrism , racism , sexism , ageism , and heterosexism — manners of judging others negatively based on their culture , race , sex , age , or sexuality .   Often , in-groups can form within a secondary group .  For instance , a workplace can have cliques of people , from senior executives who play golf together , to engineers who write code together , to young singles who socialize after hours . While these in-groups might show favoritism and affinity for other in-group members , the overall organization may be unable or unwilling to acknowledge it . Therefore , it pays to be wary of the politics of in-groups , since members may exclude others as a form of gaining status within the group ."
13,Two people who have just had a baby have turned from a _______ to a _________.,"A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the group know each other and share simultaneous interaction , such as a nuclear family , a dyad , or a triad .  Georg Simmel ( 1858 – 1915 ) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad , or two-member group , and a triad , which is a three-member group ( Simmel 1902 ) .   In the former , if one person withdraws , the group can no longer exist .   One can think of a divorce , which effectively ends the “ group ” of the married couple , or of two best friends never speaking again .   In a triad , however , the dynamic is quite different .   If one person withdraws , the group lives on .   A triad has a different set of relationships .  If there are three in the group , two-against-one dynamics can develop and there exists the potential for a majority opinion on any issue . Small groups generally have strong internal cohesiveness and a sense of connection . The challenge , however , is for small groups to achieve large goals . They can struggle to be heard or to be a force for change if they are pushing against larger groups . In short , they are easier to ignore . It is difficult to define exactly when a small group becomes a large group . One step might be when there are too many people to join in a simultaneous discussion . Another might be when a group joins with other groups as part of a movement that unites them . These larger groups may share a geographic space , such as a fraternity or sorority on the same campus , or they might be spread out around the globe . The larger the group , the more attention it can garner , and the more pressure members can put toward whatever goal they wish to achieve . At the same time , the larger the group becomes , the more the risk grows for division and lack of cohesion ."
13,Who is more likely to be an expressive leader?,"Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader . An instrumental leader is one who is goal-oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks . One can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader . In contrast , expressive leaders are more concerned with promoting emotional strength and health , and ensuring that people feel supported .  Social and religious leaders — rabbis , priests , imams , directors of youth homes and social service programs — are often perceived as expressive leaders .  There is a longstanding stereotype that men are more instrumental leaders and women are more expressive leaders . And although gender roles have changed , even today many women and men who exhibit the opposite-gender manner can be seen as deviants and can encounter resistance . Secretary of State and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton provides an example of how society reacts to a high-profile woman who is an instrumental leader . Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership ."
13,Which of the following is NOT an appropriate group for democratic leadership?,"In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles .  Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making .   These leaders work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward .   This type of leader is particularly common , for example , in a club where the members vote on which activities or projects to pursue .   These leaders can be well liked , but there is often a challenge that the work will proceed slowly since consensus building is time-consuming .   A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution .  In contrast , a laissez-faire leader ( French for “ leave it alone ” ) is hands-off , allowing group members to self-manage and make their own decisions . An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress . As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks . These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals . Often , entrepreneurs fall into this mold , like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg . Not surprisingly , this type of leader risks alienating the workers . There are times , however , when this style of leadership can be required . In different circumstances , each of these leadership styles can be effective and successful . Consider what leadership style you prefer . Why ? Do you like the same style in different areas of your life , such as a classroom , a workplace , and a sports team ?"
13,"In Asch’s study on conformity, what contributed to the ability of subjects to resist conforming?","So what was the conclusion ? Asch found that 37 out of 50 test subjects responded with an “ obviously erroneous ” answer at least once . When faced by a unanimous wrong answer from the rest of the group , the subject conformed to a mean of four of the staged answers .  Asch revised the study and repeated it , wherein the subject still heard the staged wrong answers , but was allowed to write down his answer rather than speak it aloud .  In this version , the number of examples of conformity – – giving an incorrect answer so as not to contradict the group – – fell by two thirds .  He also found that group size had an impact on how much pressure the subject felt to conform .   Sociological Research Conforming to Expectations In 1951 , psychologist Solomon Asch sat a small group of about eight people around a table .  Only one of the people sitting there was the true subject ; the rest were associates of the experimenter .  However , the subject was led to believe that the others were all , like him , people brought in for an experiment in visual judgments .  The group was shown two cards , the first card with a single vertical line , and the second card with three vertical lines differing in length . The experimenter polled the group , asking each participant one at a time which line on the second card matched up with the line on the first card . However , this was not really a test of visual judgment .  Rather , it was Asch ’ s study on the pressures of conformity .  He was curious to see what the effect of multiple wrong answers would be on the subject , who presumably was able to tell which lines matched . In order to test this , Asch had each planted respondent answer in a specific way . The subject was seated in such a way that he had to hear almost everyone else ’ s answers before it was his turn . Sometimes the non-subject members would unanimously choose an answer that was clearly wrong ."

13,Which is NOT an example of a normative organization?,"Sociologist Amitai Etzioni ( 1975 ) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories .  Normative organizations , also called voluntary organizations , are based on shared interests .   As the name suggests , joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership rewarding in an intangible way .  The Audubon Society or a ski club are examples of normative organizations . Coercive organizations are groups that one must be coerced , or pushed , to join . These may include prison or a rehabilitation center . Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) . A total institution refers to one in which inmates live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place . The third type is utilitarian organizations , which , as the name suggests , are joined because of the need for a specific material reward . High school or a workplace would fall into this category — one joined in pursuit of a diploma , the other in order to make money ."

13,Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of bureaucracies?,"Bureaucracies are an ideal type of formal organization .  Pioneer sociologist Max Weber popularly characterized a bureaucracy as having a hierarchy of authority , a clear division of labor , explicit rules , and impersonality ( 1922 ) .  People often complain about bureaucracies – – declaring them slow , rule-bound , difficult to navigate , and unfriendly . Let ’ s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to understand what they mean . Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in charge of another , who in turn must answer to her own superiors . For example , as an employee at Walmart , your shift manager assigns you tasks . Your shift manager answers to his store manager , who must answer to her regional manager , and so on in a chain of command , up to the CEO who must answer to the board members , who in turn answer to the stockholders . Everyone in this bureaucracy follows the chain of command ."
13,What are some of the intended positive aspects of bureaucracies?,"Finally , bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality , which takes personal feelings out of professional situations . This characteristic grew , to some extent , out of a desire to protect organizations from nepotism , backroom deals , and other types of favoritism , simultaneously protecting customers and others served by the organization . Impersonality is an attempt by large formal organizations to protect their members . However , the result is often that personal experience is disregarded . For example , you may be late for work because your car broke down , but the manager at Pizza Hut doesn ’ t care about why you are late , only that you are late . Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice . In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript . In order to become a lawyer and represent clients , you must graduate law school and pass the state bar exam . Of course , there are many well-documented examples of success by those who did not proceed through traditional meritocracies . Think about technology companies with founders who dropped out of college , or performers who became famous after a YouTube video went viral . How well do you think established meritocracies identify talent ? Wealthy families hire tutors , interview coaches , test-prep services , and consultants to help their kids get into the best schools . This starts as early as kindergarten in New York City , where competition for the most highly-regarded schools is especially fierce . Are these schools , many of which have copious scholarship funds that are intended to make the school more democratic , really offering all applicants a fair shake ?  There are several positive aspects of bureaucracies .   They are intended to improve efficiency , ensure equal opportunities , and increase efficiency .  And there are times when rigid hierarchies are needed . But remember that many of our bureaucracies grew large at the same time that our school model was developed – – during the Industrial Revolution . Young workers were trained and organizations were built for mass production , assembly line work , and factory jobs . In these scenarios , a clear chain of command was critical . Now , in the information age , this kind of rigid training and adherence to protocol can actually decrease both productivity and efficiency ."
13,What is an advantage of the McDonaldization of society?,"The McDonaldization of Society ( Ritzer 1993 ) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food business model in common social institutions . This business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , predictability , calculability , and control ( monitoring ) . For example , in your average chain grocery store , people at the register check out customers while stockers keep the shelves full of goods and deli workers slice meats and cheese to order ( efficiency ) . Whenever you enter a store within that grocery chain , you receive the same type of goods , see the same store organization , and find the same brands at the same prices ( predictability ) . You will find that goods are sold by the pound , so that you can weigh your fruit and vegetable purchase rather than simply guessing at the price for that bag of onions , while the employees use a timecard to calculate their hours and receive overtime pay ( calculability ) . Finally , you will notice that all store employees are wearing a uniform ( and usually a name tag ) so that they can be easily identified . There are security cameras to monitor the store , and some parts of the store , such as the stockroom , are generally considered off-limits to customers ( control ) .  While McDonaldization has resulted in improved profits and an increased availability of various goods and services to more people worldwide , it has also reduced the variety of goods available in the marketplace while rendering available products uniform , generic , and bland .  Think of the difference between a mass-produced shoe and one made by a local cobbler , between a chicken from a family-owned farm versus a corporate grower , or a cup of coffee from the local diner instead of one from Starbucks ."

14,Which of the following is not true?," Dodge v . Ford ( 1919 ) and Shlensky v . Wrigley ( 1968 ) established the dynamic nature of the debate over the shareholder primacy doctrine and indicated a shift in both legal thought and precedent toward allowing management greater latitude in deciding how to best manage a corporation .  A more recent decision , Burwell v . Hobby Lobby ( 2014 ) , demonstrated what some may consider the double-edged sword of this latitude . 7 In a 5 – 4 decision in favor of Hobby Lobby , the Supreme Court ruled that some corporations ( those that are closely held by a few shareholders ) can object on ethical , moral , or religious grounds to the Affordable Care Act ’ s rule that health insurance policies must cover various forms of contraception ; such companies can elect not to offer such coverage .  The Wrigley case represented a shift from the idea that corporations should pursue only the maximization of shareholder value , as had been held in the Ford Motor Company case .  6 As a follow-up to this case , lights were finally installed at Wrigley Field in 1988 , but only after the owner , William Wrigley III , had sold the team ( in 1981 ) to the Tribune Company , a large media conglomerate that fought for six years to install lights . However , the case stands as precedent for the ability of management to balance various interests and profits when making decisions . The legality and appropriateness of social responsibility as a business policy have followed a long and winding road since 1919 .  In the 1950s and 1960s , for example , some state courts rejected the shareholder primacy doctrine , instead ruling that a broad interpretation of the business judgment rule allowed managers discretion when it came to allocating company assets , including using them for programs demonstrating social awareness .  In Dodge v . Ford Motor Company ( 1919 ) , the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in favor of shareholder primacy , saying that founder Henry Ford must operate the Ford Motor Company primarily in the profit-maximizing interests of its shareholders . 2 In the traditional corporate model , a corporation earns revenue and , after deducting expenses , distributes the profits to shareholders in the form of dividends .  Ford had announced that his company would stop paying big dividends to shareholders and instead would use its profits to achieve several other goals , including improving product quality , expanding company facilities , and perhaps most surprisingly , lowering prices .  Shareholders then sued Ford , asking the court to order Ford Motor Company to continue allocating the lion ’ s share of profits to high dividend payments . ( It is ironic that the named shareholders who sued Ford were the Dodge brothers , former Ford suppliers who had recently started their own car company . )"
14,Industries like to be in control of their own destiny and as a result prefer self-regulation to laws imposed by governments. Self-regulation is often ________.,"These two philosophies might be characterized as less government regulation vs . no government regulation , other than military defense . The preference for state regulation is often based on a belief in the business community that many states are softer on regulation that the federal government , or that states are closer to the problems businesses face and are more efficient at addressing them . However , there is little clear evidence that one branch of government is more efficient than another . The real challenge is weighing the benefits of regulation against the costs , and finding the right balance between over - and under-regulation .  Weak regulation can allow a business to cut corners .  For instance , auto emission regulations intended to go into effect by certain dates have been delayed multiple times during the 1980s and the early 2000s . The Obama administration announced plans to enforce tougher rules , but the current administration has said it plans to delay implementation . Auto emission regulations have become politically charged , constantly changing depending on the party in power , and some states have responded with their own legislation instead of waiting for the federal stalemate to end . Regulation that is consistently enforced in the effort to achieve the long-term goal , such as cleaner air , is preferable to a moving target ."
14,Which of the following best describes the tragedy of the commons?,"Cormac Cullinan , an environmental attorney , author , and leading proponent of earth jurisprudence , often collaborates with other environmental advocates such as Thomas Berry , an eco-theologian , scholar , and author . Cullinan , Berry , and others have written extensively about the important legal tenets of earth jurisprudence ; however , it is not a legal doctrine officially adopted by the United States or any of its states to date .  The concept of earth justice is tied indirectly to the economic theory of the “ tragedy of the commons , ” a phrase derived from British economist William Forster Lloyd , who , in the mid-nineteenth century , used a hypothetical example of unregulated grazing on common land to explain the human tendency to act independently , putting self-interest first , without regard for the common good of all users .  The theory was later popularized by ecologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin , who tied it directly to environmental issues . In other words , when it comes to natural resources , the tragedy of the commons holds that people generally use as much of a free resource as they want , without regard for the needs of others or for the long-term environmental effects . As a way of combating the tragedy of the commons , Cullinan and others have written about the concept of earth justice , 24 which includes the following tenets :"
14,ISOs are sustainability standards for businesses ________.," The International Organization for Standardization , or ISO , is an independent NGO and the world ’ s largest developer of voluntary international business standards .  More than twenty thousand ISO standards now cover matters such as sustainability , manufactured products , technology , food , agriculture , and even healthcare . The adoption and use of these standards by companies is voluntary , but they are widely accepted , and following ISO certification guidelines results in the creation of products and services that are clean , safe , reliable , and made by workers who enjoy some degree of protection from workplace hazards ."
14,Which of the following is a potentially effective way to reduce global warming?," One method of dealing with the long-term harm caused by pollution is a carbon tax , that is , a “ pay-to-pollute ” system that charges a fee or tax to those who discharge carbon into the air .  A carbon tax serves to motivate users of fossil fuels , which release harmful carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at no cost , to switch to cleaner energy sources or , failing that , to at least pay for the climate damage they cause , based on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions generated from burning fossil fuels . A proposal to implement a carbon tax system in the United States has been recommended by many organizations , including the conservative Climate Leadership Council ( CLC ) . 46 Exxon Mobil , Shell , British Petroleum , and Total , along with other oil companies and a number of large corporations in other industries , recently announced their support for the plan to tax carbon emissions put forth by the CLC . 47"
14,Which of the following is true?,"Sometimes , however , the relationship between business and government can become too close , as when executives from the private sector leave their jobs to work for government agencies , becoming the regulators rather than the regulated , and then return to industry in a kind of “ revolving door ” effect . For example , Goldman Sachs , one of the world ’ s largest financial services firms , has seen many of its executives take senior leadership positions in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans , including the present secretary of the treasury , Steven Mnuchin . The same trend is occurring on a global level ; Mario Draghi , the president of the European Central Bank , was previously a vice chair and managing director of Goldman Sachs International , and Mark Carney , the governor of the Bank of England , worked for Goldman Sachs as well .  The large number of executives from one of the biggest investment banks in the world moving in and out of government service causes some critics to warn of the “ fox guarding the hen house ” approach to regulation .  Is the relationship between government and the private sector sometimes too cozy ? Does this revolving door in fact result in bad policy ?"
14,Which of the following constitutional provisions gives regulatory power to the federal government?,"Over the past decade , many politicians have run for office on a platform of reducing government regulation . There are at least two closely related positions on reducing federal government regulation . The first is essentially a states ’ rights position that seeks to limit the powers of the federal government to those very specifically enumerated in the Constitution . It is based on principles embodied in the Tenth Amendment and on a narrow interpretation of the Commerce Clause . The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states any right not specifically delegated to the federal government .  The Commerce Clause is the part of the Constitution that gives the federal government the right to regulate commerce between states . "
14,The Citizens United case ________.,"Questions of regulation and political influence have become even more sensitive in recent years , following the decision in Citizens United v . Federal Election Commission ( 2010 ) .  71 In Citizens United , the U . S . Supreme Court ruled 5 – 4 that laws preventing corporations from using general treasury funds for political advertising violated the First Amendment ’ s guarantee of freedom of speech .   In other words , the government may not prevent corporations from spending money to support or oppose candidates in elections .   With this decision , the Court invalidated numerous campaign finance reform laws .  Many commentators think the decision opened the floodgates for special-interest groups to spend without limit in U . S . elections ."
15,What goods are available to all without direct payment?,"Thus , the market cannot provide everything ( in enough quantity or at low enough costs ) in order to meet everyone ’ s needs . Therefore , some goods are provided by the government .  Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods .  Two such public goods are national security and education . It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack . How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack ? Who would pay the men and women who served ? Where would the intelligence come from ? Due to its ability to tax , draw upon the resources of an entire nation , and compel citizen compliance , only government is capable of protecting the nation ."
15,In which form of government does a small group of elite people hold political power?,"Most countries now have some form of representative government ( Figure 1.6 ) .  At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government .   In a monarchy , one ruler , usually a hereditary ruler , holds political power .  Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law , and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country , this is not always the case . Many southwest Asian kingdoms , such as Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and the United Arab Emirates , have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted . As discussed earlier , another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy , in which a handful of elite members of society , often those who belong to a particular political party , hold all political power . For example , in Cuba , as in China , only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office , and the party ’ s most important members make all government decisions . Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature . Under totalitarianism , the government is more important than the citizens , and it controls all aspects of citizens ’ lives . Citizens ’ rights are limited , and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition . These forms of government are fairly rare . North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government ."
15,The elite theory of government maintains that ________.,"The foremost supporter of elite theory was C . Wright Mills . In his book , The Power Elite , Mills argued that government was controlled by a combination of business , military , and political elites . 5 Most are highly educated , often graduating from prestigious universities ( Figure 1.7 ) .  According to elite theory , the wealthy use their power to control the nation ’ s economy in such a way that those below them cannot advance economically .   Their wealth allows the elite to secure for themselves important positions in politics .   They then use this power to make decisions and allocate resources in ways that benefit them .   Politicians do the bidding of the wealthy instead of attending to the needs of ordinary people , and order is maintained by force .  Indeed , those who favor government by the elite believe the elite are better fit to govern and that average citizens are content to allow them to do so . 6  Many Americans fear that a set of elite citizens is really in charge of government in the United States and that others have no influence .   This belief is called the elite theory of government .  In contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government , which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government . Pluralist theorists assume that citizens who want to get involved in the system do so because of the great number of access points to government . That is , the U . S . system , with several levels and branches , has many places where people and groups can engage the government ."
15,"According to the pluralist theory of government, ________."," According to pluralist theory , people with shared interests will form groups in order to make their desires known to politicians .   These groups include such entities as environmental advocates , unions , and organizations that represent the interests of various businesses .  Because most people lack the inclination , time , or expertise necessary to decide political issues , these groups will speak for them .  As groups compete with one another and find themselves in conflict regarding important issues , government policy begins to take shape .   In this way , government policy is shaped from the bottom up and not from the top down , as we see in elitist theory .  Robert Dahl , author of Who Governs ? , was one of the first to advance the pluralist theory , and argued that politicians seeking an “ electoral payoff ” are attentive to the concerns of politically active citizens and , through them , become acquainted with the needs of ordinary people . They will attempt to give people what they want in exchange for their votes . 15 Many Americans fear that a set of elite citizens is really in charge of government in the United States and that others have no influence . This belief is called the elite theory of government .  In contrast to that perspective is the pluralist theory of government , which says that political power rests with competing interest groups who share influence in government .

15,Which of the following is a good example of a tradeoff?," Tradeoffs are especially common in the United States Congress .   Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives usually vote according to the concerns of people who live in their districts .   Not only does this often pit the interests of people in different parts of the country against one another , but it also frequently favors the interests of certain groups of people over the interests of others within the same state .  For example , allowing oil companies to drill off the state ’ s coast may please those who need the jobs that will be created , but it will anger those who wish to preserve coastal lands as a refuge for wildlife and , in the event of an accident , may harm the interests of people who depend on fishing and tourism for their living . At times , House members and senators in Congress may ignore the voters in their home states and the groups that represent them in order to follow the dictates of the leaders of the political party to which they belong . For example , a member of Congress from a state with a large elderly population may be inclined to vote in favor of legislation to increase benefits for retired people ; however , his or her political party leaders , who disapprove of government spending on social programs , may ask for a vote against it . The opposite can occur as well , especially in the case of a legislator soon facing re-election . With two-year terms of office , we are more likely to see House members buck their party in favor of their constituents ."
15,Supporting the actions of the Democratic Party simply because one identifies oneself as a member of that party is an example of ________.,"Why are younger Americans less likely to become involved in traditional political organizations ? One answer may be that as American politics become more partisan in nature , young people turn away .  Committed partisanship , which is the tendency to identify with and to support ( often blindly ) a particular political party , alienates some Americans who feel that elected representatives should vote in support of the nation ’ s best interests instead of voting in the way their party wishes them to .  When elected officials ignore all factors other than their party ’ s position on a particular issue , some voters become disheartened while others may become polarized . However , a recent study reveals that it is a distrust of the opposing party and not an ideological commitment to their own party that is at the heart of most partisanship among voters . 26"
15,"When a person is asked a question about a political issue that he or she has little interest in and has not thought much about, that person’s answer will likely reflect ________.","The likelihood that people will become active in politics also depends not only on age but on such factors as wealth and education . In a 2006 poll , the percentage of people who reported that they were regular voters grew as levels of income and education increased . 32 Political involvement also depends on how strongly people feel about current political issues .  Unfortunately , public opinion polls , which politicians may rely on when formulating policy or deciding how to vote on issues , capture only people ’ s latent preferences or beliefs .   Latent preferences are not deeply held and do not remain the same over time .   They may not even represent a person ’ s true feelings , since they may be formed on the spot when someone is asked a question about which he or she has no real opinion .  Indeed , voting itself may reflect merely a latent preference because even people who do not feel strongly about a particular political candidate or issue vote . On the other hand , intense preferences are based on strong feelings regarding an issue that someone adheres to over time . People with intense preferences tend to become more engaged in politics ; they are more likely to donate time and money to campaigns or to attend political rallies . The more money that one has and the more highly educated one is , the more likely that he or she will form intense preferences and take political action . 33"
16,Solute contributes to the movement of water between cells and the surrounding medium by ________.,"The chemical reactions of life take place in aqueous solutions . The dissolved substances in a solution are called solutes . In the human body , solutes vary in different parts of the body , but may include proteins — including those that transport lipids , carbohydrates , and , very importantly , electrolytes . Often in medicine , a mineral dissociated from a salt that carries an electrical charge ( an ion ) is called an electrolyte . For instance , sodium ions ( Na + ) and chloride ions ( Cl - ) are often referred to as electrolytes . In the body , water moves through semi-permeable membranes of cells and from one compartment of the body to another by a process called osmosis .  Osmosis is basically the diffusion of water from regions of higher concentration of water to regions of lower concentration of water , along an osmotic gradient across a semi-permeable membrane .   As a result , water will move into and out of cells and tissues , depending on the relative concentrations of the water and solutes found there .  An appropriate balance of solutes inside and outside of cells must be maintained to ensure normal function ."
16,A cation has a(n) ________ charge.,"Most body fluids are neutral in charge .  Thus , cations , or positively charged ions , and anions , or negatively charged ions , are balanced in fluids .  As seen in the previous graph , sodium ( Na + ) ions and chloride ( Cl - ) ions are concentrated in the ECF of the body , whereas potassium ( K + ) ions are concentrated inside cells . Although sodium and potassium can “ leak ” through “ pores ” into and out of cells , respectively , the high levels of potassium and low levels of sodium in the ICF are maintained by sodium-potassium pumps in the cell membranes . These pumps use the energy supplied by ATP to pump sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell ( Figure 26.6 ) ."
16,Interstitial fluid (IF) is ________.,"Body fluids can be discussed in terms of their specific fluid compartment , a location that is largely separate from another compartment by some form of a physical barrier . The intracellular fluid ( ICF ) compartment is the system that includes all fluid enclosed in cells by their plasma membranes . Extracellular fluid ( ECF ) surrounds all cells in the body .  Extracellular fluid has two primary constituents : the fluid component of the blood ( called plasma ) and the interstitial fluid ( IF ) that surrounds all cells not in the blood ( Figure 26.3 ) . "
16,The largest amount of water leaves the body via ________.,"On a typical day , the average adult will take in about 2500 mL ( almost 3 quarts ) of aqueous fluids . Although most of the intake comes through the digestive tract , about 230 mL (8 ounces ) per day is generated metabolically , in the last steps of aerobic respiration .  Additionally , each day about the same volume ( 2500 mL ) of water leaves the body by different routes ; most of this lost water is removed as urine .  The kidneys also can adjust blood volume though mechanisms that draw water out of the filtrate and urine . The kidneys can regulate water levels in the body ; they conserve water if you are dehydrated , and they can make urine more dilute to expel excess water if necessary . Water is lost through the skin through evaporation from the skin surface without overt sweating and from air expelled from the lungs . This type of water loss is called insensible water loss because a person is usually unaware of it ."
16,Insensible water loss is water lost via ________.,"On a typical day , the average adult will take in about 2500 mL ( almost 3 quarts ) of aqueous fluids .

Water is lost through the skin through evaporation from the skin surface without overt sweating and from air expelled from the lungs .   This type of water loss is called insensible water loss because a person is usually unaware of it . "
16,How soon after drinking a large glass of water will a person start increasing their urine output?," The kidneys also must make adjustments in the event of ingestion of too much fluid .   Diuresis , which is the production of urine in excess of normal levels , begins about 30 minutes after drinking a large quantity of fluid .  Diuresis reaches a peak after about 1 hour , and normal urine production is reestablished after about 3 hours ."
16,Bone serves as a mineral reserve for which two ions?," About two pounds of calcium in your body are bound up in bone , which provides hardness to the bone and serves as a mineral reserve for calcium and its salts for the rest of the tissues .  Teeth also have a high concentration of calcium within them . A little more than one-half of blood calcium is bound to proteins , leaving the rest in its ionized form . Calcium ions , Ca 2 + , are necessary for muscle contraction , enzyme activity , and blood coagulation . In addition , calcium helps to stabilize cell membranes and is essential for the release of neurotransmitters from neurons and of hormones from endocrine glands . These six ions aid in nerve excitability , endocrine secretion , membrane permeability , buffering body fluids , and controlling the movement of fluids between compartments . These ions enter the body through the digestive tract .  More than 90 percent of the calcium and phosphate that enters the body is incorporated into bones and teeth , with bone serving as a mineral reserve for these ions .  In the event that calcium and phosphate are needed for other functions , bone tissue can be broken down to supply the blood and other tissues with these minerals . Phosphate is a normal constituent of nucleic acids ; hence , blood levels of phosphate will increase whenever nucleic acids are broken down . Excretion of ions occurs mainly through the kidneys , with lesser amounts lost in sweat and in feces . Excessive sweating may cause a significant loss , especially of sodium and chloride . Severe vomiting or diarrhea will cause a loss of chloride and bicarbonate ions . Adjustments in respiratory and renal functions allow the body to regulate the levels of these ions in the ECF ."
16,The major cation in extracellular fluid is ________.," Sodium is the major cation of the extracellular fluid .  It is responsible for one-half of the osmotic pressure gradient that exists between the interior of cells and their surrounding environment . People eating a typical Western diet , which is very high in NaCl , routinely take in 130 to 160 mmol / day of sodium , but humans require only 1 to 2 mmol / day . This excess sodium appears to be a major factor in hypertension ( high blood pressure ) in some people . Excretion of sodium is accomplished primarily by the kidneys . Sodium is freely filtered through the glomerular capillaries of the kidneys , and although much of the filtered sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule , some remains in the filtrate and urine , and is normally excreted ."
16,The major cation in intracellular fluid is ________.," Potassium is the major intracellular cation .  It helps establish the resting membrane potential in neurons and muscle fibers after membrane depolarization and action potentials . In contrast to sodium , potassium has very little effect on osmotic pressure . The low levels of potassium in blood and CSF are due to the sodium-potassium pumps in cell membranes , which maintain the normal potassium concentration gradients between the ICF and ECF . The recommendation for daily intake / consumption of potassium is 4700 mg . Potassium is excreted , both actively and passively , through the renal tubules , especially the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts . Potassium participates in the exchange with sodium in the renal tubules under the influence of aldosterone , which also relies on basolateral sodium-potassium pumps ."
16,The major anion in extracellular fluid is ________.," Chloride is the predominant extracellular anion .  Chloride is a major contributor to the osmotic pressure gradient between the ICF and ECF , and plays an important role in maintaining proper hydration . Chloride functions to balance cations in the ECF , maintaining the electrical neutrality of this fluid . The paths of secretion and reabsorption of chloride ions in the renal system follow the paths of sodium ions ."
16,Most of the body’s calcium is found in ________.,"These six ions aid in nerve excitability , endocrine secretion , membrane permeability , buffering body fluids , and controlling the movement of fluids between compartments . These ions enter the body through the digestive tract .  More than 90 percent of the calcium and phosphate that enters the body is incorporated into bones and teeth , with bone serving as a mineral reserve for these ions .  In the event that calcium and phosphate are needed for other functions , bone tissue can be broken down to supply the blood and other tissues with these minerals .

Severe vomiting or diarrhea will cause a loss of chloride and bicarbonate ions . Adjustments in respiratory and renal functions allow the body to regulate the levels of these ions in the ECF ."
16,Abnormally increased blood levels of sodium are termed ________.," Hypernatremia is an abnormal increase of blood sodium .  It can result from water loss from the blood , resulting in the hemoconcentration of all blood constituents . Hormonal imbalances involving ADH and aldosterone may also result in higher-than-normal sodium values ."
16,Which two ions are most affected by aldosterone?,"In the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys , aldosterone stimulates the synthesis and activation of the sodium-potassium pump ( Figure 26.14 ) . Sodium passes from the filtrate , into and through the cells of the tubules and ducts , into the ECF and then into capillaries . Water follows the sodium due to osmosis .  Thus , aldosterone causes an increase in blood sodium levels and blood volume .   Aldosterone ’ s effect on potassium is the reverse of that of sodium ; under its influence , excess potassium is pumped into the renal filtrate for excretion from the body .   Sodium is reabsorbed from the renal filtrate , and potassium is excreted into the filtrate in the renal collecting tubule .   The control of this exchange is governed principally by two hormones — aldosterone and angiotensin II .  Aldosterone"
16,Which of the following is the most important buffer inside red blood cells?," Hemoglobin is the principal protein inside of red blood cells and accounts for one-third of the mass of the cell .   During the conversion of CO 2 into bicarbonate , hydrogen ions liberated in the reaction are buffered by hemoglobin , which is reduced by the dissociation of oxygen .  This buffering helps maintain normal pH . The process is reversed in the pulmonary capillaries to re-form CO 2 , which then can diffuse into the air sacs to be exhaled into the atmosphere . This process is discussed in detail in the chapter on the respiratory system ."
16,Which explanation best describes why plasma proteins can function as buffers?,"Nearly all proteins can function as buffers .  Proteins are made up of amino acids , which contain positively charged amino groups and negatively charged carboxyl groups .   The charged regions of these molecules can bind hydrogen and hydroxyl ions , and thus function as buffers .  Buffering by proteins accounts for two-thirds of the buffering power of the blood and most of the buffering within cells ."
16,The buffer that is adjusted to control acid-base balance is ________.,"The buffer systems functioning in blood plasma include plasma proteins , phosphate , and bicarbonate and carbonic acid buffers .  The kidneys help control acid-base balance by excreting hydrogen ions and generating bicarbonate that helps maintain blood plasma pH within a normal range .  Protein buffer systems work predominantly inside cells ."
16,Carbonic acid levels are controlled through the ________.,"Renal Regulation of Acid-Base Balance The renal regulation of the body ’ s acid-base balance addresses the metabolic component of the buffering system .  Whereas the respiratory system ( together with breathing centers in the brain ) controls the blood levels of carbonic acid by controlling the exhalation of CO 2 , the renal system controls the blood levels of bicarbonate .  A decrease of blood bicarbonate can result from the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase by certain diuretics or from excessive bicarbonate loss due to diarrhea . Blood bicarbonate levels are also typically lower in people who have Addison ’ s disease ( chronic adrenal insufficiency ) , in which aldosterone levels are reduced , and in people who have renal damage , such as chronic nephritis . Finally , low bicarbonate blood levels can result from elevated levels of ketones ( common in unmanaged diabetes mellitus ) , which bind bicarbonate in the filtrate and prevent its conservation ."
16,Bicarbonate ion concentrations in the blood are controlled through the ________.,"As with the phosphate buffer , a weak acid or weak base captures the free ions , and a significant change in pH is prevented . Bicarbonate ions and carbonic acid are present in the blood in a 20:1 ratio if the blood pH is within the normal range . With 20 times more bicarbonate than carbonic acid , this capture system is most efficient at buffering changes that would make the blood more acidic . This is useful because most of the body ’ s metabolic wastes , such as lactic acid and ketone bodies , are acids . Carbonic acid levels in the blood are controlled by the expiration of CO 2 through the lungs . In red blood cells , carbonic anhydrase forces the dissociation of the acid , rendering the blood less acidic . Because of this acid dissociation , CO 2 is exhaled ( see equations above ) .  The level of bicarbonate in the blood is controlled through the renal system , where bicarbonate ions in the renal filtrate are conserved and passed back into the blood .  However , the bicarbonate buffer is the primary buffering system of the IF surrounding the cells in tissues throughout the body ."
16,Which of the following is a cause of metabolic acidosis?,"The first three of the eight causes of metabolic acidosis listed are medical ( or unusual physiological ) conditions . Strenuous exercise can cause temporary metabolic acidosis due to the production of lactic acid . The last five causes result from the ingestion of specific substances . The active form of aspirin is its metabolite , sulfasalicylic acid . An overdose of aspirin causes acidosis due to the acidity of this metabolite . Metabolic acidosis can also result from uremia , which is the retention of urea and uric acid . Metabolic acidosis can also arise from diabetic ketoacidosis , wherein an excess of ketone bodies are present in the blood .  Other causes of metabolic acidosis are a decrease in the excretion of hydrogen ions , which inhibits the conservation of bicarbonate ions , and excessive loss of bicarbonate ions through the gastrointestinal tract due to diarrhea . "
16,Which of the following is a cause of respiratory acidosis?,"Respiratory acidosis occurs when the blood is overly acidic due to an excess of carbonic acid , resulting from too much CO 2 in the blood .  Respiratory acidosis can result from anything that interferes with respiration , such as pneumonia , emphysema , or congestive heart failure . "
16,"At a pH of 7.40, the carbonic acid ratio is ________.","Metabolic acidosis occurs when the blood is too acidic ( pH below 7.35 ) due to too little bicarbonate , a condition called primary bicarbonate deficiency .  At the normal pH of 7.40 , the ratio of bicarbonate to carbonic acid buffer is 20:1 .  If a person ’ s blood pH drops below 7.35 , then he or she is in metabolic acidosis . The most common cause of metabolic acidosis is the presence of organic acids or excessive ketone bodies in the blood . Table 26.2 lists some other causes of metabolic acidosis ."
16,Which of the following is characterized as metabolic alkalosis?," Alkalosis is characterized by a higher-than-normal pH .   Metabolic alkalosis is problematic , as elevated pH and excess bicarbonate are present .   The PCO 2 would again be normal at first , but if compensation has occurred , it would increase as the body attempts to reestablish the proper ratios of bicarbonate and carbonic acid / CO 2 . "
17,What was Lincoln’s primary goal immediately following the Civil War?," The end of the Civil War saw the beginning of the Reconstruction era , when former rebel Southern states were integrated back into the Union .   President Lincoln moved quickly to achieve the war ’ s ultimate goal : reunification of the country .  He proposed a generous and non-punitive plan to return the former Confederate states speedily to the United States , but some Republicans in Congress protested , considering the president ’ s plan too lenient to the rebel states that had torn the country apart . The greatest flaw of Lincoln ’ s plan , according to this view , was that it appeared to forgive traitors instead of guaranteeing civil rights to formerly enslaved people . President Lincoln oversaw the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery , but he did not live to see its ratification ."
17,"In 1864 and 1865, Radical Republicans were most concerned with ________.","The Fourteenth Amendment stated , “ All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . ” It gave citizens equal protection under both the state and federal law , overturning the Dred Scott decision . It eliminated the three-fifths compromise of the 1787 Constitution , whereby an enslaved person had been counted as three-fifths of a free White person , and it reduced the number of House representatives and Electoral College electors for any state that denied suffrage to any adult male inhabitant , Black or White .  As Radical Republicans had proposed in the Wade-Davis bill , individuals who had “ engaged in insurrection or rebellion [ against ] .  . .  or given aid or comfort to the enemies [ of ] ” the United States were barred from holding political ( state or federal ) or military office unless pardoned by two-thirds of Congress .   In February 1864 , two of the Radical Republicans , Ohio senator Benjamin Wade and Maryland representative Henry Winter Davis , answered Lincoln with a proposal of their own .   Among other stipulations , the Wade-Davis Bill called for a majority of voters and government officials in Confederate states to take an oath , called the Ironclad Oath , swearing that they had never supported the Confederacy or made war against the United States .   Those who could not or would not take the oath would be unable to take part in the future political life of the South .  Congress assented to the Wade-Davis Bill , and it went to Lincoln for his signature . The president refused to sign , using the pocket veto ( that is , taking no action ) to kill the bill . Lincoln understood that no Southern state would have met the criteria of the Wade-Davis Bill , and its passage would simply have delayed the reconstruction of the South . Lincoln hoped that the leniency of the plan — 90 percent of the 1860 voters did not have to swear allegiance to the Union or to emancipation — would bring about a quick and long-anticipated resolution and make emancipation more acceptable everywhere . This approach appealed to some in the moderate wing of the Republican Party , which wanted to put the nation on a speedy course toward reconciliation . However , the proposal instantly drew fire from a larger faction of Republicans in Congress who did not want to deal moderately with the South . These members of Congress , known as Radical Republicans , wanted to remake the South and punish the rebels .  Radical Republicans insisted on harsh terms for the defeated Confederacy and protection for formerly enslaved people , going far beyond what the president proposed . "
17,Which of the following was not one of the functions of the Freedmen’s Bureau?,"The Freedmen ’ s Bureau engaged in many initiatives to ease the transition from slavery to freedom . It delivered food to Blacks and Whites alike in the South .  It helped freed people gain labor contracts , a significant step in the creation of wage labor in place of slavery .   It helped reunite families of freedmen , and it also devoted much energy to education , establishing scores of public schools where freed people and poor Whites could receive both elementary and higher education .  Respected institutions such as Fisk University , Hampton University , and Dillard University are part of the legacy of the Freedmen ’ s Bureau ."
17,Which person or group was most responsible for the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment?,"Questions swirled about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 . The Supreme Court , in its 1857 decision forbidding Black citizenship , had interpreted the Constitution in a certain way ; many argued that the 1866 statute , alone , could not alter that interpretation .  Seeking to overcome all legal questions , Radical Republicans drafted another constitutional amendment with provisions that followed those of the 1866 Civil Rights Act .   In July 1866 , the Fourteenth Amendment went to state legislatures for ratification . "
17,"Under Radical Reconstruction, which of the following did former Confederate states not need to do in order to rejoin the Union?","Though Grant did not side with the Radical Republicans , his victory allowed the continuance of the Radical Reconstruction program . In the winter of 1869 , Republicans introduced another constitutional amendment , the third of the Reconstruction era . When Republicans had passed the Fourteenth Amendment , which addressed citizenship rights and equal protections , they were unable to explicitly ban states from withholding the franchise based on race .  With the Fifteenth Amendment , they sought to correct this major weakness by finally extending to Black men the right to vote .   The amendment directed that “ [ t ] he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . ” Unfortunately , the new amendment had weaknesses of its own .  As part of a compromise to ensure the passage of the amendment with the broadest possible support , drafters of the amendment specifically excluded language that addressed literacy tests and poll taxes , the most common ways Blacks were traditionally disenfranchised in both the North and the South . Indeed , Radical Republican leader Charles Sumner of Massachusetts , himself an ardent supporter of legal equality without exception to race , refused to vote for the amendment precisely because it did not address these obvious loopholes . The 1867 Military Reconstruction Act , which encompassed the vision of Radical Republicans , set a new direction for Reconstruction in the South . Republicans saw this law , and three supplementary laws passed by Congress that year , called the Reconstruction Acts , as a way to deal with the disorder in the South .  The 1867 act divided the ten southern states that had yet to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment into five military districts ( Tennessee had already been readmitted to the Union by this time and so was excluded from these acts ) .   Martial law was imposed , and a Union general commanded each district .   These generals and twenty thousand federal troops stationed in the districts were charged with protecting freed people .   When a supplementary act extended the right to vote to all freed men of voting age ( 21 years old ) , the military in each district oversaw the elections and the registration of voters .   Only after new state constitutions had been written and states had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment could these states rejoin the Union .  Predictably , President Johnson vetoed the Reconstruction Acts , viewing them as both unnecessary and unconstitutional .  Once again , Congress overrode Johnson ’ s vetoes , and by the end of 1870 , all the southern states under military rule had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and been restored to the Union ( Figure 16.7 ) . "
17,The House of Representatives impeached Andrew Johnson over ________.,"The Republican majority in Congress by now despised the president , and they wanted to prevent him from interfering in congressional Reconstruction . To that end , Radical Republicans passed two laws of dubious constitutionality . The Command of the Army Act prohibited the president from issuing military orders except through the commanding general of the army , who could not be relieved or reassigned without the consent of the Senate . The Tenure of Office Act , which Congress passed in 1867 , required the president to gain the approval of the Senate whenever he appointed or removed officials . Congress had passed this act to ensure that Republicans who favored Radical Reconstruction would not be barred or stripped of their jobs . In August 1867 , President Johnson removed Secretary of War Edwin M . Stanton , who had aligned himself with the Radical Republicans , without gaining Senate approval . He replaced Stanton with Ulysses S . Grant , but Grant resigned and sided with the Republicans against the president .  Many Radical Republicans welcomed this blunder by the president as it allowed them to take action to remove Johnson from office , arguing that Johnson had openly violated the Tenure of Office Act .   The House of Representatives quickly drafted a resolution to impeach him , a first in American history . "
17,Which of the following is not one of the methods the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist groups used to intimidate Blacks and White sympathizers?,"The Klan seized on the pervasive but largely fictional narrative of the northern carpetbagger as a powerful tool for restoring White supremacy and overturning Republican state governments in the South ( Figure 16.13 ) .  To preserve a White-dominated society , Klan members punished Blacks for attempting to improve their station in life or acting “ uppity . ” To prevent freed people from attaining an education , the Klan burned public schools .   In an effort to stop Blacks from voting , the Klan murdered , whipped , and otherwise intimidated freed people and their White supporters .   It wasn ’ t uncommon for Klan members to intimidate Union League members and Freedmen ’ s Bureau workers .   The Klan even perpetrated acts of political assassination , killing a sitting U . S . congressman from Arkansas and three state congressmen from South Carolina . "
17,Which of the following was the term southerners used for a White southerner who tried to overturn the changes of Reconstruction?,"While the president and Congress may have seen the Klan and other clandestine White supremacist , terrorist organizations as a threat to stability and progress in the South , many southern Whites saw them as an instrument of order in a world turned upside down . Many White southerners felt humiliated by the process of Radical Reconstruction and the way Republicans had upended southern society , placing Black people in positions of authority while taxing large landowners to pay for the education of formerly enslaved people .  Those committed to rolling back the tide of Radical Reconstruction in the South called themselves redeemers , a label that expressed their desire to redeem their states from northern control and to restore the antebellum social order whereby Blacks were kept safely under the boot heel of Whites .  They represented the Democratic Party in the South and worked tirelessly to end what they saw as an era of “ negro misrule . ” By 1877 , they had succeeded in bringing about the “ redemption ” of the South , effectively destroying the dream of Radical Reconstruction ."
18,"Neurons contain ________, which can receive signals from other neurons.","It is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone — neuronal communication depends on the connections that neurons make with one another ( as well as with other cells , like muscle cells ) .  Dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons .  For example , dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons . Like other cells , each neuron has a cell body ( or soma ) that contains a nucleus , smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , mitochondria , and other cellular components . Neurons also contain unique structures , illustrated in Figure 35.3 for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible .  Dendrites are tree-like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses .  Although some neurons do not have any dendrites , some types of neurons have multiple dendrites . Dendrites can have small protrusions called dendritic spines , which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections ."
18,A(n) ________ neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending directly from the cell body.,"While there are many defined neuron cell subtypes , neurons are broadly divided into four basic types : unipolar , bipolar , multipolar , and pseudounipolar . Figure 35.5 illustrates these four basic neuron types . Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma . These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands .  A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma .  An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell , which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain . Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron . Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites . Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) . An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum , which has many branching dendrites but only one axon . Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells . A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma , like a unipolar cell , but this process later branches into two distinct structures , like a bipolar cell . Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions : one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord ."
18,Glia that provide myelin for neurons in the brain are called ________.,"There are several different types of glia with different functions , two of which are shown in Figure 35.7 . Astrocytes , shown in Figure 35.8 a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS . They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons , regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid , and provide structural support for synapses . Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier — a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain . Astrocytes , in particular , have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity , transmit calcium waves between astrocytes , and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses . Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS . Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms .  Oligodendrocytes , shown in Figure 35.8 b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS .   One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes , and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons .  This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon . Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations . Ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord . They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid , which serves as a cushion for the brain , moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain , and is a component for the choroid plexus . 35.2 How Neurons Communicate Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :  The nervous system is made up of neurons , specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals , and glia , cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons .  A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire — it transmits a signal from one place to another .  Glia can be compared to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places , maintain the wires , and take down wires that are broken .  Although glia have been compared to workers , recent evidence suggests that also usurp some of the signaling functions of neurons ."
18,"For a neuron to fire an action potential, its membrane must reach ________.","Signal Summation Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron , but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential . This process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock , as illustrated in Figure 35.16 . Additionally , one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons — some excitatory and some inhibitory — so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa .  It is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential .  Together , synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “ noise ” in the system is not transmitted as important information . Action Potential A neuron can receive input from other neurons and , if this input is strong enough , send the signal to downstream neurons . Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter . Transmission of a signal within a neuron ( from dendrite to axon terminal ) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential . When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron ’ s dendrites , ion channels open . At excitatory synapses , this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane — a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron . A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential ( - 55 mV ) . Na + channels in the axon hillock open , allowing positive ions to enter the cell ( Figure 35.10 and Figure 35.11 ) . Once the sodium channels open , the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about + 40 mV .  Action potentials are considered an "" all-or nothing "" event , in that , once the threshold potential is reached , the neuron always completely depolarizes .  Once depolarization is complete , the cell must now "" reset "" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential . To accomplish this , the Na + channels close and cannot be opened . This begins the neuron's refractory period , in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open . At the same time , voltage-gated K + channels open , allowing K + to leave the cell . As K + ions leave the cell , the membrane potential once again becomes negative . The diffusion of K + out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell , in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential . At this point , the sodium channels will return to their resting state , meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential . Eventually the extra K + ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels , bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state , back to its resting membrane potential ."
18,"After an action potential, the opening of additional voltage-gated ________ channels and the inactivation of sodium channels, cause the membrane to return to its resting membrane potential.","Action Potential A neuron can receive input from other neurons and , if this input is strong enough , send the signal to downstream neurons .

Once the sodium channels open , the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about + 40 mV .  Action potentials are considered an "" all-or nothing "" event , in that , once the threshold potential is reached , the neuron always completely depolarizes .

Eventually the extra K + ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels , bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state , back to its resting membrane potential .   Resting Membrane Potential A neuron at rest is negatively charged : the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside ( − 70 mV , note that this number varies by neuron type and by species ) .   This voltage is called the resting membrane potential ; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell .  If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions , each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium . Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will , there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell , as shown in Table 35.1 .  The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions ( K + ) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential ( Figure 35.10 ) .  When the membrane is at rest , K + ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the concentration gradient . The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell ( in the extracellular fluid ) relative to inside the cell ( in the cytoplasm ) .  The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement .  In neurons , potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell .  The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient .  However , the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels . Therefore , potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in . Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering , this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell . The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential , once established . Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K + ions into the cell while removing three Na + ions per ATP consumed . As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in , the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid . It should be noted that chloride ions ( Cl – ) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm ."
18,What is the term for protein channels that connect two neurons at an electrical synapse?,"While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses , they are found in all nervous systems and play important and unique roles . The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses .  In an electrical synapse , the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions .  Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell to the next . In addition to the ions that carry this current , other molecules , such as ATP , can diffuse through the large gap junction pores ."
18,The ________ lobe contains the visual cortex.," The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds .  It also contains the hippocampus ( Greek for “ seahorse ” ) — a structure that processes memory formation . The hippocampus is illustrated in Figure 35.24 . The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic patient , HM , who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy . His seizures went away , but he could no longer form new memories ( although he could remember some facts from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks ) .  The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain .   It is primarily involved in vision — seeing , recognizing , and identifying the visual world .   The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain .   Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading .  Two of the parietal lobe ’ s main functions are processing somatosensation — touch sensations like pressure , pain , heat , cold — and processing proprioception — the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space . The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex .  The frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain , over the eyes .   This lobe contains the olfactory bulb , which processes smells .  The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex , which is important for planning and implementing movement . Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups , and there is some organization to this map , as shown in Figure 35.22 . For example , the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement of the hand . Neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention , speech , and decision-making . Studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality , socialization , and assessing risk ."
18,The ________ connects the two cerebral hemispheres.," In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy , the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere .   This causes a condition called split-brain , which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres .  For example , when an object is presented to patients ’ left visual field , they may be unable to verbally name the object ( and may claim to not have seen an object at all ) . This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center , which generally is found in the left side of the brain . Remarkably , if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand , the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to vocally identify it . The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull . It includes the cerebral cortex , limbic system , basal ganglia , thalamus , hypothalamus , and cerebellum . There are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures : a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right , as shown in Figure 35.21 b , a coronal section cuts the brain front to back , as shown in Figure 35.20 a , and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom . Cerebral Cortex The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex , which is folded into hills called gyri ( singular : gyrus ) and valleys called sulci ( singular : sulcus ) . The cortex is made up of two hemispheres — right and left — which are separated by a large sulcus .  A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum ( Latin : “ tough body ” ) connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other .  Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other , the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant . In fact , sometimes ( very rarely ) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy . While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery , they can have surprisingly few problems , especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems ."
18,Neurons in the ________ control motor reflexes.," Spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body .   Each of the 31 spinal nerves ( in humans ) contains both sensory and motor axons .  The sensory neuron cell bodies are grouped in structures called dorsal root ganglia and are shown in Figure 35.29 . Each sensory neuron has one projection — with a sensory receptor ending in skin , muscle , or sensory organs — and another that synapses with a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord . Motor neurons have cell bodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord that project to muscle through the ventral root . These neurons are usually stimulated by interneurons within the spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons . 35.5 Nervous System Disorders Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to : In the United States , there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year .  Because the spinal cord is the information superhighway connecting the brain with the body , damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis .  The extent of the paralysis depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed . For example , if the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck , it can cause paralysis from the neck down , whereas damage to the spinal column further down may limit paralysis to the legs . Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves do not regenerate , although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves . Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury . One such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia . This cooling can prevent swelling and other processes that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries . 35.4 The Peripheral Nervous System Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to : Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord , shown in Figure 35.21 .  The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body .  The spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves ( part of the peripheral nervous system ) . A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape , as illustrated in Figure 35.25 . Myelinated axons make up the “ white matter ” and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the “ gray matter . ” Gray matter is also composed of interneurons , which connect two neurons each located in different parts of the body . Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal ( facing the back of the animal ) spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain . Axons and cell bodies in the ventral ( facing the front of the animal ) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body .  The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes .  These reflexes are quick , unconscious movements — like automatically removing a hand from a hot object . Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections . For example , the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron . While a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses , synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened ( the knee jerked , or the hand was hot ) ."
18,Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes:," The parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated ( the common adrenaline dump you feel after a ‘ fight-or-flight ’ event ) .   Effects of acetylcholine release on target organs include slowing of heart rate , lowered blood pressure , and stimulation of digestion .  Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord , as illustrated in Figure 35.27 . The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia ( the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord ) . The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons . Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs .  As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test , speech , or athletic event can attest , the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive .  This is both because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons , amplifying the effect of the original synapse , and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine ( and the closely related hormone epinephrine ) into the blood stream .  The physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi ( making it easier for the animal to breathe ) , increasing heart rate , and moving blood from the skin to the heart , muscles , and brain ( so the animal can think and run ) .  The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger , and scientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTP — allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and avoid it in the future . The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the “ fight or flight ” response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation . One way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake ( “ snake ” and “ sympathetic ” both begin with “ s ” ) .  Examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion .  These functions help prepare an organism ’ s body for the physical strain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator ."
18,Where are parasympathetic preganglionic cell bodies located?,"While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations , the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to “ rest and digest . ” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic , the parasympathetic nervous system is in control ( “ picnic ” and “ parasympathetic ” both start with “ p ” ) .  Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral ( toward the bottom ) spinal cord , as shown in Figure 35.27 .  The axons of the preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine on the postganglionic neurons , which are generally located very near the target organs . Most postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine onto target organs , although some release nitric oxide ."
18,________ is released by motor nerve endings onto muscle.,"The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons . Sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin , skeletal muscle , and sensory organs to the CNS . Motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract . Without its sensory-somatic nervous system , an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment ( what it sees , feels , hears , and so on ) and could not control motor movements .  Unlike the autonomic nervous system , which has two synapses between the CNS and the target organ , sensory and motor neurons have only one synapse — one ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron .   Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these synapses .  Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord , as illustrated in Figure 35.27 .  The axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia ( the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord ) .  The acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons . Postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs . As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test , speech , or athletic event can attest , the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive . This is both because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons , amplifying the effect of the original synapse , and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine ( and the closely related hormone epinephrine ) into the blood stream . The physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi ( making it easier for the animal to breathe ) , increasing heart rate , and moving blood from the skin to the heart , muscles , and brain ( so the animal can think and run ) . The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger , and scientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTP — allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and avoid it in the future . Once a signal is received by the dendrite , it then travels passively to the cell body . The cell body contains a specialized structure , the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon .  An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .   These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons , muscle , or target organs .  Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells . Neurons usually have one or two axons , but some neurons , like amacrine cells in the retina , do not contain any axons . Some axons are covered with myelin , which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon , greatly increasing the speed on conduction . This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter — from the base of the spine to the toes . The myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron . Myelin is produced by glial cells . Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath . These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “ recharged ” as it travels along the axon ."
18,Parkinson’s disease is a caused by the degeneration of neurons that release ________.,"There is no cure for Parkinson ’ s disease , and treatment is focused on easing symptoms .  One of the most commonly prescribed drugs for Parkinson ’ s is L-DOPA , which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the brain .  This conversion increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra . Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine . Like Alzheimer ’ s disease , Parkinson ’ s disease is a neurodegenerative disease . It was first characterized by James Parkinson in 1817 . Each year , 50,000- 60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease .  Parkinson ’ s disease causes the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra , a midbrain structure that regulates movement .  Loss of these neurons causes many symptoms including tremor ( shaking of fingers or a limb ) , slowed movement , speech changes , balance and posture problems , and rigid muscles . The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk , illustrated in Figure 35.31 . Patients with Parkinson ’ s disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms , such as dementia or emotional problems ."
18,________ medications are often used to treat patients with ADHD.,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . Like ASD , ADHD is more prevalent in males than females . Symptoms of the disorder include inattention ( lack of focus ) , executive functioning difficulties , impulsivity , and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal developmental stage . Some patients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of ADHD : attention deficit disorder ( ADD ) . Many people with ADHD also show comorbitity , in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to ADHD . Examples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . Figure 35.32 provides some statistics concerning comorbidity with ADHD . The cause of ADHD is unknown , although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex and disturbances in neurotransmission . According to studies of twins , the disorder has a strong genetic component . There are several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder , but no definitive links have been discovered . Environmental factors , including exposure to certain pesticides , may also contribute to the development of ADHD in some patients .  Treatment for ADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications , which paradoxically cause a calming effect in these patients . "
18,Strokes are often caused by ________.,"A stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage . Without the oxygen supplied by blood flow , neurons in this brain region die . This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms — depending on the brain area affected — including headache , muscle weakness or paralysis , speech disturbances , sensory problems , memory loss , and confusion .  Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel .  Strokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States . On average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States . Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65 . Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol , and a family history of stroke . Smoking doubles the risk of stroke . Because a stroke is a medical emergency , patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the emergency room , where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed . These drugs will not work if the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital . Treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication ( to prevent future strokes ) and ( sometimes intense ) physical therapy ."
19,An amortization table ________.,"We can use an amortization table , or schedule , prepared using Microsoft Excel or other financial software , to show the loan balance for the duration of the loan .  An amortization table calculates the allocation of interest and principal for each payment and is used by accountants to make journal entries .  These journal entrieswill be discussed later in this chapter ."
19,A debenture is ________.,"Bonds themselves can have different characteristics .  For example , a debenture is an unsecured bond issued based on the good name and reputation of the company .  These companies are not pledging other assets to cover the amount in case they fail to pay the debt , or default . The opposite of a debenture is a secured bond , meaning the company is pledging a specific asset as collateral for the bond . With a secured bond , if the company goes under and cannot pay back the bond , the pledged asset would be sold , and the proceeds would be distributed to the bondholders ."
19,The principal of a bond is ________.,"Now let us look at bonds in more depth . A bond is a type of financial instrument that a company issues directly to investors , bypassing banks or other lending institutions , with a promise to pay the investor a specified rate of interest over a specified period of time . When a company borrows money by selling bonds , it is said the company is “ issuing ” bonds . This means the company exchanges cash for a promise to repay the cash , along with interest , over a set period of time . As you ’ ve learned , bonds are formal legal documents that contain specific information related to the bond . In short , it is a legal contract — called a bond certificate ( as shown in Figure 13.3 ) or an indenture — between the issuer ( the business borrowing the money ) and the lender ( the investor lending the money ) . Bonds are typically issued in relatively small denominations , such as $ 1,000 so they can be placed in the market and are accessible to a greater market of investors compared to notes .  The bond indenture is a contract that lists the features of the bond , such as the amount of money that will be repaid in the future , called the principal ( also called face value or maturity value ); the maturity date , the day the bond holder will receive the principal amount ; and the stated interest rate , which is the rate of interest the issuer agrees to pay the bondholder throughout the term of the bond . "
19,A convertible bond can be converted into ________.," A convertible bond can be converted to common stock in a one-way , one-time conversion .  Under what conditions would it make sense to convert ? Suppose the face-value interest rate of the bond is 8 % . If the company is doing well this year , such that there is an expectation that shareholders will receive a significant dividend and the stock price will rise , the stock might appear to be more valuable than the return on the bond ."
19,The International Financial Reporting Standards require the use of ________.,"Our calculations have used what is known as the effective-interest method , a method that calculates interest expense based on the carrying value of the bond and the market interest rate . Generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) require the use of the effective-interest method unless there is no significant difference between the effective-interest method and the straight-line method , a method that allocates the same amount of the bond discount or premium for each interest payment . The effective interest amortization method is more accurate than the straight-line method .  International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) require the use of the effective-interest method , with no exceptions . "
19,The cash interest payment a corporation makes to its bondholders is based on ________.," The cash interest payment is still the stated rate times the principal .  The interest on carrying value is still the market rate times the carrying value . The difference in the two interest amounts is used to amortize the discount , but now the amortization of discount amount is added to the carrying value ."
19,The difference between equity financing and debt financing is that," For a corporation , equity financing involves trading or selling shares of stock in the business to raise funds to run the business .  For a sole proprietorship , selling part of the business means it is no longer a sole proprietorship : the subsequent transaction could create either a corporation or partnership . The owners would choose which of the two to create . Equity means ownership . However , business owners can be creative in selling interest in their venture . For example , Maria might sell interest in the building housing her candy store and retain all revenues for herself , or she may decide to share interest in the operations ( sales revenues ) and retain sole ownership of the building .  With equity financing , a business owner sells part of the business to obtain money to finance business operations .  With this type of financing , the original owner gives up some portion of ownership in the company in return for cash . In Maria ’ s case , partners would supplement her $ 200,000 and would then own a share of the business . Each partner ’ s share is based on their financial or other contributions . Although we briefly addressed equity versus debt financing in Explain the Pricing of Long-Term Liabilities , we will now review the two options . Let ’ s consider Maria , who wants to buy a business . The venture is for sale for $ 1 million , but she only has $ 200,000 . What are her options ?  In this situation , a business owner can use debt financing by borrowing money or equity financing by selling part of the company , or she can use a combination of both . "
20,"If xenon has an atomic number of 54 and a mass number of 108, how many neutrons does it have?","Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons .  The number of protons determines an element ’ s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another .   The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess .   Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’ s mass number , as illustrated in Figure 2.3 .  Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number . This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number . Since an element ’ s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes . Often , the resulting number contains a fraction . For example , the atomic mass of chlorine ( Cl ) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes , some ( the majority ) with atomic mass 35 ( 17 protons and 18 neutrons ) and some with atomic mass 37 ( 17 protons and 20 neutrons ) ."
20,Atoms that vary in the number of neutrons found in their nuclei are called ________.," Isotopes Isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons .  Some elements — such as carbon , potassium , and uranium — have naturally occurring isotopes . Carbon - 12 contains six protons , six neutrons , and six electrons ; therefore , it has a mass number of 12 ( six protons and six neutrons ) . Carbon - 14 contains six protons , eight neutrons , and six electrons ; its atomic mass is 14 ( six protons and eight neutrons ) . These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes . Some isotopes may emit neutrons , protons , and electrons , and attain a more stable atomic configuration ( lower level of potential energy ); these are radioactive isotopes , or radioisotopes . Radioactive decay ( carbon - 14 decaying to eventually become nitrogen - 14 ) describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atom ’ s nucleus releases radiation . Evolution Connection Carbon Dating Atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons . The number of protons determines an element ’ s atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another .

20,Potassium has an atomic number of 19. What is its electron configuration?,"Recall that the Bohr model depicts an atom ’ s electron shell configuration . Within each electron shell are subshells , and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons . While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located , scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path . Subshells are designated by the letter s , p , d , and f . The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital .  Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital , which can hold two electrons .   Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell , and can hold a total of eight electrons .  The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals , as illustrated in Figure 2.8 . Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals , respectively . These are not shown in the illustration .  Principal shell 3n has s , p , and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons .   Principal shell 4n has s , p , d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons .   Moving away from the nucleus , the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases .  Progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table , the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital . The closest orbital to the nucleus , called the 1s orbital , can hold up to two electrons . This orbital is equivalent to the innermost electron shell of the Bohr model of the atom . It is called the 1 s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus .  The 1 s orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus , and it is always filled first , before any other orbital can be filled .  Hydrogen has one electron ; therefore , it has only one spot within the 1 s orbital occupied . This is designated as 1 s 1 , where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1 s orbital . Helium has two electrons ; therefore , it can completely fill the 1 s orbital with its two electrons . This is designated as 1 s 2 , referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1 s orbital . On the periodic table Figure 2.5 , hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row ( period ); this is because they only have electrons in their first shell , the 1 s orbital . Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1 s and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state ."
20,Which type of bond represents a weak chemical bond?,"Hydrogen Bonds and Van Der Waals Interactions Ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break . Ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent , which determines their behavior in biological systems . However , not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds . Weaker bonds can also form between molecules .  Two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions .  Without these two types of bonds , life as we know it would not exist . Hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical , life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and DNA , the building block of cells . When polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form , the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogen ’ s electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen . Because the hydrogen is slightly positive , it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges . When this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ + of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ – charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule . This interaction is called a hydrogen bond . This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules . Individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken ; however , they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers , creating a major force in combination . Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the DNA double helix . Like hydrogen bonds , van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules . Van der Waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities , which are not always symmetrical around an atom . For these attractions to happen , the molecules need to be very close to one another . These bonds — along with ionic , covalent , and hydrogen bonds — contribute to the three-dimensional structure of the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function .

20,Which of the following statements is not true?,"Why do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets ? Why is water so important ? It is because water is essential to life as we know it .  Water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on Earth .  Approximately 60 – 70 percent of the human body is made up of water . Without it , life as we know it simply would not exist . The polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties that are intimately tied to the processes of life . Life originally evolved in a watery environment , and most of an organism ’ s cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cell ’ s cytoplasm . Special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization , its ability to dissolve polar molecules , its cohesive and adhesive properties , and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of pH . Understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life ."
20,"When acids are added to a solution, the pH should ________.","The pH scale is , as previously mentioned , an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 ( Figure 2.19 ) .  Anything below 7.0 ( ranging from 0.0 to 6.9 ) is acidic , and anything above 7.0 ( from 7.1 to 14.0 ) is alkaline .  Extremes in pH in either direction from 7.0 are usually considered inhospitable to life . The pH inside cells ( 6.8 ) and the pH in the blood ( 7.4 ) are both very close to neutral .  However , the environment in the stomach is highly acidic , with a pH of 1 to 2 .  So how do the cells of the stomach survive in such an acidic environment ? How do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral pH inside them ? The answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying . New stomach cells are constantly produced to replace dead ones , which are digested by the stomach acids . It is estimated that the lining of the human stomach is completely replaced every seven to ten days ."
20,A molecule that binds up excess hydrogen ions in a solution is called a(n) ________.,"The concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1 × 10 - 7 moles H + ions per liter of water . Moles ( mol ) are a way to express the amount of a substance ( which can be atoms , molecules , ions , etc ) , with one mole being equal to 6.02 x 10 23 particles of the substance . Therefore , 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 x 10 23 water molecules . The pH is calculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration . The log 10 of 1 × 10 - 7 is -7.0 , and the negative of this number ( indicated by the “ p ” of “ pH ” ) yields a pH of 7.0 , which is also known as neutral pH . The pH inside of human cells and blood are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral pH is maintained . Non-neutral pH readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water . Using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers , high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH number , whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH . An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H + ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate .  A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH – ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH .   In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions , these ions bind to free hydrogen ions , generating new water molecules . "
20,Which of the following statements is true?,"So how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral pH ingest acidic and basic substances ( a human drinking orange juice , for example ) and survive ? Buffers are the key .  Buffers readily absorb excess H + or OH – , keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival .  Maintaining a constant blood pH is critical to a person ’ s well-being . The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid ( H 2 CO 3 ) , bicarbonate ion ( HCO 3 – ) , and carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) . When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid , hydrogen ions are removed , moderating pH changes . Similarly , as shown in Figure 2.20 , excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs . This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood ’ s pH . Likewise , if too much OH – is introduced into the system , carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate , lowering the pH . Without this buffer system , the body ’ s pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy ."
20,Each carbon molecule can bond with as many as________ other atom(s) or molecule(s).,"Individual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell .  With an atomic number of 6 ( six electrons and six protons ) , the first two electrons fill the inner shell , leaving four in the second shell .   Therefore , carbon atoms can form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule .  The methane molecule provides an example : it has the chemical formula CH 4 . Each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons . This results in a filled outermost shell . Cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids ( RNA and DNA ) , carbohydrates , and lipids . The macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules ( any carbon-containing liquid , solid , or gas ) that are especially important for life . The fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon .  The carbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms , making this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component , or “ backbone , ” of the macromolecules . "
20,Which of the following is not a functional group that can bond with carbon?,"A functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions .  Some of the important functional groups in biological molecules are shown in Figure 2.27 ; they include : hydroxyl , methyl , carbonyl , carboxyl , amino , phosphate , and sulfhydryl .  These groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like DNA , proteins , carbohydrates , and lipids . Functional groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics . An example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methane molecule . Among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group found in amino acids , some amino acid side chains , and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids . This carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions ( H + ) from the COOH group resulting in the negatively charged COO - group ; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on . Other functional groups , such as the carbonyl group , have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules , again making the molecule more hydrophilic ."
21,Mark Twain’s Gilded Age is a reference to ________.," Defining American Mark Twain and the Gilded Age Mark Twain ( Figure 20.4 ) wrote The Gilded Age : A Tale of Today with his neighbor , Charles Dudley Warner , as a satire about the corrupt politics and lust for power that he felt characterized American society at the time .  The book , the only novel Twain ever co-authored , tells of the characters ’ desire to sell their land to the federal government and become rich . It takes aim at both the government in Washington and those Americans , in the South and elsewhere , whose lust for money and status among the newly rich in the nation ’ s capital leads them to corrupt and foolish choices .  Mark Twain coined the phrase “ Gilded Age ” in a book he co-authored with Charles Dudley Warner in 1873 , The Gilded Age : A Tale of Today .   The book satirized the corruption of post-Civil War society and politics .  Indeed , popular excitement over national growth and industrialization only thinly glossed over the stark economic inequalities and various degrees of corruption of the era ( Figure 20.3 ) . Politicians of the time largely catered to business interests in exchange for political support and wealth . Many participated in graft and bribery , often justifying their actions with the excuse that corruption was too widespread for a successful politician to resist . The machine politics of the cities , specifically Tammany Hall in New York , illustrate the kind of corrupt , but effective , local and national politics that dominated the era ."
21,How did the Great Compromise of 1877 influence the election?,"As a result of the disputed election , the House of Representatives established a special electoral commission to determine which candidate won the challenged electoral votes of these three states .  In what later became known as the Compromise of 1877 , Republican Party leaders offered southern Democrats an enticing deal .   The offer was that if the commission found in favor of a Hayes victory , Hayes would order the withdrawal of the remaining U . S . troops from those three southern states , thus allowing the collapse of the radical Reconstruction governments of the immediate post-Civil War era .  This move would permit southern Democrats to end federal intervention and control their own states ’ fates in the wake of the end of slavery ( Figure 20.6 ) ."
21,A Mugwump is ________.,"Such bold attempts at reform further convinced Republican Party leaders , as the 1884 election approached , that Arthur was not their best option to continue in the White House . Arthur quickly found himself a man without a party . As the 1884 election neared , the Republican Party again searched their ranks for a candidate who could restore some semblance of the spoils system while maintaining a reformist image .  Unable to find such a man , the predominant Half-Breeds again turned to their own leader , Senator Blaine .   However , when news of his many personal corrupt bargains began to surface , a significant portion of the party chose to break from the traditional Stalwarts-versus-Half-Breeds debate and form their own faction , the Mugwumps , a name taken from the Algonquin phrase for “ great chief . ” "
21,Which president made significant steps towards civil service reform?," Surprising both his party and the Democrats when he assumed the office of president , Chester Arthur immediately distanced himself from the Stalwarts .  Although previously a loyal party man , Arthur understood that he owed his current position to no particular faction or favor .  He was in the unique position to usher in a wave a civil service reform unlike any other political candidate , and he chose to do just that .  In 1883 , he signed into law the Pendleton Civil Service Act , the first significant piece of antipatronage legislation . This law created the Civil Service Commission , which listed all government patronage jobs and then set aside approximately 10 percent of the list as appointments to be determined through a competitive civil service examination process . Furthermore , to prevent future presidents from undoing this reform , the law declared that future presidents could enlarge the list but could never shrink it by moving a civil service job back into the patronage column ."
21,Which of the following was not a vehicle for the farmers’ protest?," In 1891 , the alliance formed the Populist Party , or People ’ s Party , as it was more widely known .  Beginning with nonpresidential-year elections , the Populist Party had modest success , particularly in Kansas , Nebraska , and the Dakotas , where they succeeded in electing several state legislators , one governor , and a handful of congressmen . As the 1892 presidential election approached , the Populists chose to model themselves after the Democratic and Republican Parties in the hope that they could shock the country with a “ third-party ” victory .  Angry at the federal government ’ s continued unwillingness to substantively address the plight of the average farmer , Charles Macune and the Farmers ’ Alliance chose to create a political party whose representatives — if elected — could enact real change .  Put simply , if the government would not address the problem , then it was time to change those elected to power .  The Farmers ’ Alliance , a conglomeration of three regional alliances formed in the mid - 1880s , took root in the wake of the Grange movement .  In 1890 , Dr . Charles Macune , who led the Southern Alliance , which was based in Texas and had over 100,000 members by 1886 , urged the creation of a national alliance between his organization , the Northwest Alliance , and the Colored Alliance , the largest African American organization in the United States . Led by Tom Watson , the Colored Alliance , which was founded in Texas but quickly spread throughout the Old South , counted over one million members . Although they originally advocated for self-help , African Americans in the group soon understood the benefits of political organization and a unified voice to improve their plight , regardless of race . While racism kept the alliance splintered among the three component branches , they still managed to craft a national agenda that appealed to their large membership . All told , the Farmers ’ Alliance brought together over 2.5 million members , 1.5 million White and 1 million Black ( Figure 20.14 ) .  One of the first efforts to organize farmers came in 1867 with Oliver Hudson Kelly ’ s creation of the Patrons of Husbandry , more popularly known as the Grange .  In the wake of the Civil War , the Grangers quickly grew to over 1.5 million members in less than a decade ( Figure 20.13 ) . Kelly believed that farmers could best help themselves by creating farmers ’ cooperatives in which they could pool resources and obtain better shipping rates , as well as prices on seeds , fertilizer , machinery , and other necessary inputs . These cooperatives , he believed , would let them self-regulate production as well as collectively obtain better rates from railroad companies and other businesses ."
21,Which of the following contributed directly to the plight of farmers?," Overproduction of crops occurred in part due to the westward expansion of homestead farms and in part because industrialization led to new farm tools that dramatically increased crop yields .  As farmers fell deeper into debt , whether it be to the local stores where they bought supplies or to the railroads that shipped their produce , their response was to increase crop production each year in the hope of earning more money with which to pay back their debt .  The more they produced , the lower prices dropped .   To a hard-working farmer , the notion that their own overproduction was the greatest contributing factor to their debt was a completely foreign concept ( Figure 20.12 ) .  The challenges that many American farmers faced in the last quarter of the nineteenth century were significant . They contended with economic hardships born out of rapidly declining farm prices , prohibitively high tariffs on items they needed to purchase , and foreign competition .  One of the largest challenges they faced was overproduction , where the glut of their products in the marketplace drove the price lower and lower . "
21,How were members of Coxey’s Army received when they arrived in Washington?,"A notable example of the government ’ s failure to act was the story of Coxey ’ s Army .  In the spring of 1894 , businessman Jacob Coxey led a march of unemployed Ohioans from Cincinnati to Washington , DC , where leaders of the group urged Congress to pass public works legislation for the federal government to hire unemployed workers to build roads and other public projects .  From the original one hundred protesters , the march grew five hundred strong as others joined along the route to the nation ’ s capital .  Upon their arrival , not only were their cries for federal relief ignored , but Coxey and several other marchers were arrested for trespassing on the grass outside the U . S . Capitol .  Frustration over the event led many angry workers to consider supporting the Populist Party in subsequent elections . Americana L . Frank Baum : Did Coxey ’ s Army inspire Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz ? Scholars , historians , and economists have long argued inconclusively that L . Frank Baum intended the story of The Wizard of Oz as an allegory for the politics of the day . Whether that actually was Baum ’ s intention is up for debate , but certainly the story could be read as support for the Populist Party ’ s crusade on behalf of American farmers . In 1894 , Baum witnessed Coxey ’ s Army ’ s march firsthand , and some feel it may have influenced the story ( Figure 20.16 ) ."
21,Which of the following does not represent one of the ways in which William Jennings Bryan appealed to Populists?,"The Republicans remained steadfast in their defense of a gold-based standard for the American economy , as well as high protective tariffs . They turned to William McKinley , former congressman and current governor of Ohio , as their candidate . At their convention , the Democrats turned to William Jennings Bryan — a congressman from Nebraska .  Bryan defended the importance of a silver-based monetary system and urged the government to coin more silver .   Furthermore , being from farm country , he was very familiar with the farmers ’ plight and saw some merit in the subtreasury system proposal .  In short , Bryan could have been the ideal Populist candidate , but the Democrats got to him first . The Populist Party subsequently endorsed Bryan as well , with their party ’ s nomination three weeks later ( Figure 20.17 ) ."
22,"For many uses in the laboratory, polyclonal antibodies work well, but for some types of assays, they lack sufficient ________ because they cross-react with inappropriate antigens."," Some types of assays require better antibody specificity and affinity than can be obtained using a polyclonal antiserum .  To attain this high specificity , all of the antibodies must bind with high affinity to a single epitope . This high specificity can be provided by monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) . Table 20.1 compares some of the important characteristics of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies ."
22,How are monoclonal antibodies produced?," Unlike polyclonal antibodies , which are produced in live animals , monoclonal antibodies are produced in vitro using tissue-culture techniques .  mAbs are produced by immunizing an animal , often a mouse , multiple times with a specific antigen . B cells from the spleen of the immunized animal are then removed .  Since normal B cells are unable to proliferate forever , they are fused with immortal , cancerous B cells called myeloma cells , to yield hybridoma cells .   All of the cells are then placed in a selective medium that allows only the hybridomas to grow ; unfused myeloma cells cannot grow , and any unfused B cells die off .   The hybridomas , which are capable of growing continuously in culture while producing antibodies , are then screened for the desired mAb .   Those producing the desired mAb are grown in tissue culture ; the culture medium is harvested periodically and mAbs are purified from the medium .  This is a very expensive and time-consuming process . It may take weeks of culturing and many liters of media to provide enough mAbs for an experiment or to treat a single patient . mAbs are expensive ( Figure 20.4 ) ."
22,The formation of ________ is a positive result in the VDRL test.," To perform the VDRL test , patient serum or cerebral spinal fluid is placed on a slide with a mixture of cardiolipin ( an antigenic phospholipid found in the mitochondrial membrane of various pathogens ) , lecithin , and cholesterol .   The lecithin and cholesterol stabilize the reaction and diminish false positives .   Anti-treponemal antibodies from an infected patient ’ s serum will bind cardiolipin and form a flocculant .   Although the VDRL test is more specific than the original Wassermann assay , false positives may still occur in patients with autoimmune diseases that cause extensive cell damage ( e . g . , systemic lupus erythematosus ) . "
22,The titer of a virus neutralization test is the highest dilution of patient serum,"During the course of a viral infection , the patient will mount an antibody response to the virus , and we can quantify those antibodies using a plaque reduction assay . To perform the assay , a serial dilution is carried out on a serum sample . Each dilution is then mixed with a standardized amount of the suspect virus . Any virus-specific antibodies in the serum will neutralize some of the virus .  The suspensions are then added to host cells in culture to allow any nonneutralized virus to infect the cells and form plaques after several days .   The titer is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution showing a 50 % reduction in plaques .  Titer is always expressed as a whole number . For example , if a 1/64 dilution was the highest dilution to show 50 % plaque reduction , then the titer is 64 ."
22,"In the Ouchterlony assay, we see a sharp precipitin arc form between antigen and antiserum. Why does this arc remain visible for a long time?"," When agar is highly purified , it produces a clear , colorless gel .  Holes are punched in the gel to form wells , and antigen and antisera are added to neighboring wells .  Proteins are able to diffuse through the gel , and precipitin arcs form between the wells at the zone of equivalence .   Because the precipitin lattice is too large to diffuse through the gel , the arcs are firmly locked in place and easy to see ( Figure 20.8 ) .   Ouchterlony Assay "
22,We use antisera to distinguish between various ________ within a species of bacteria.," Lancefield used antisera to show that different strains of the same species of streptococci express different versions of M protein , which explains why children can come down with strep throat repeatedly .  Lancefield classified beta-hemolytic streptococci into many groups based on antigenic differences in group-specific polysaccharides located in the bacterial cell wall .  The strains are called serovars because they are differentiated using antisera .  Identifying the serovars present in a disease outbreak is important because some serovars may cause more severe disease than others ."
22,"When using antisera to characterize bacteria, we will often link the antibodies to ________ to better visualize the agglutination."," To identify antibodies in a patient ’ s serum , the antigen of interest is attached to latex beads .   When mixed with patient serum , the antibodies will bind the antigen , cross-linking the latex beads and causing the beads to agglutinate indirectly ; this indicates the presence of the antibody ( Figure 20.17 ) .  This technique is most often used when looking for IgM antibodies , because their structure provides maximum cross-linking . One widely used example of this assay is a test for rheumatoid factor ( RF ) to confirm a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis . RF is , in fact , the presence of IgM antibodies that bind to the patient ’ s own IgG . RF will agglutinate IgG-coated latex beads . The method developed by Lancefield is a direct agglutination assay , since the bacterial cells themselves agglutinate .  A similar strategy is more commonly used today when identifying serovars of bacteria and viruses ; however , to improve visualization of the agglutination , the antibodies may be attached to inert latex beads .   This technique is called an indirect agglutination assay ( or latex fixation assay ) , because the agglutination of the beads is a marker for antibody binding to some other antigen ( Figure 20.16 ) .  Indirect assays can be used to detect the presence of either antibodies or specific antigens ."
22,The antibody screening test that is done along with pretransfusion blood typing is used to ensure that the recipient," Red blood cells have many other antigens in addition to ABO and Rh .   While most people are unlikely to have antibodies against these antigens , women who have had multiple pregnancies or patients who have had multiple transfusions may have them because of repeated exposure .   For this reason , an antibody screen test is used to determine if such antibodies are present .  Patient serum is checked against commercially prepared , pooled , type O red blood cells that express these antigens . If agglutination occurs , the antigen to which the patient is responding must be identified and determined not to be present in the donor unit ."
22,The direct Coombs’ test is designed to detect when people have a disease that causes them to," The Coombs ’ test is often employed when a newborn has jaundice , yellowing of the skin caused by high blood concentrations of bilirubin , a product of the breakdown of hemoglobin in the blood .   The Coombs ’ test is used to determine whether the child ’ s red blood cells have been bound by the mother ’ s antibodies .  These antibodies would activate complement , leading to red blood cell lysis and the subsequent jaundice . Other conditions that can cause positive direct Coombs ’ tests include hemolytic transfusion reactions , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , infectious mononucleosis ( caused by Epstein-Barr virus ) , syphilis , and Mycoplasma pneumonia . A positive direct Coombs ’ test may also be seen in some cancers and as an allergic reaction to some drugs ( e . g . , penicillin ) . Agglutination of red blood cells is called hemagglutination .  One common assay that uses hemagglutination is the direct Coombs ’ test , also called the direct antihuman globulin test ( DAT ) , which generally looks for nonagglutinating antibodies .   The test can also detect complement attached to red blood cells . "
22,Viral hemagglutination assays only work with certain types of viruses because," Antibodies that bind to red blood cells are not the only cause of hemagglutination .   Some viruses also bind to red blood cells , and this binding can cause agglutination when the viruses cross-link the red blood cells .  For example , influenza viruses have two different types of viral spikes called neuraminidase ( N ) and hemagglutinin ( H ) , the latter named for its ability to agglutinate red blood cells ( see Viruses ) . Thus , we can use red blood cells to detect the presence of influenza virus by direct hemagglutination assays ( HA ) , in which the virus causes visible agglutination of red blood cells . The mumps and rubella viruses can also be detected using HA ."
22,"In an enzyme immunoassay, the enzyme"," Similar to the western blot , enzyme immunoassays ( EIAs ) use antibodies to detect the presence of antigens .  However , EIAs differ from western blots in that the assays are conducted in microtiter plates or in vivo rather than on an absorbent membrane .  There are many different types of EIAs , but they all involve an antibody molecule whose constant region binds an enzyme , leaving the variable region free to bind its specific antigen .  The addition of a substrate for the enzyme allows the antigen to be visualized or quantified ( Figure 20.22 ) ."
22,"In a lateral-flow pregnancy test, you see a blue band form on the control line and no band form on the test line. This is probably a ________ test for pregnancy."," In lateral flow tests ( Figure 20.27 ) , fluids such as urine are applied to an absorbent pad on the test strip .  The fluid flows by capillary action and moves through a stripe of beads with antibodies attached to their surfaces . The fluid in the sample actually hydrates the reagents , which are present in a dried state in the stripe . Antibody-coated beads made of latex or tiny gold particles will bind antigens in the test fluid .  The antibody-antigen complexes then flow over a second stripe that has immobilized antibody against the antigen ; this stripe will retain the beads that have bound antigen .   A third control stripe binds any beads .   A red color ( from gold particles ) or blue ( from latex beads ) developing at the test line indicates a positive test .   If the color only develops at the control line , the test is negative . "
22,"When performing an FEIA, the fluorogen replaces the ________ that is used in an EIA."," In EIAs , the substrate for the enzyme is most often a chromogen , a colorless molecule that is converted into a colored end product .  The most widely used enzymes are alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase for which appropriate substrates are readily available .  In some EIAs , the substrate is a fluorogen , a nonfluorescent molecule that the enzyme converts into a fluorescent form .   EIAs that utilize a fluorogen are called fluorescent enzyme immunoassays ( FEIAs ) .  Fluorescence can be detected by either a fluorescence microscope or a spectrophotometer ."
22,"In a direct fluorescent antibody test, which of the following would we most likely be looking for using a fluorescently-labeled mAb?"," Direct fluorescent antibody ( DFA ) tests use a fluorescently labeled mAb to bind and illuminate a target antigen .  DFA tests are particularly useful for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial diseases . For example , fluorescence-labeled antibodies against Streptococcus pyogenes ( group A strep ) can be used to obtain a diagnosis of strep throat from a throat swab . The diagnosis is ready in a matter of minutes , and the patient can be started on antibiotics before even leaving the clinic . DFA techniques may also be used to diagnose pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila from sputum samples ( Figure 20.28 ) . The fluorescent antibodies bind to the bacteria on a microscope slide , allowing ready detection of the bacteria using a fluorescence microscope .  Thus , the DFA technique is valuable for visualizing certain bacteria that are difficult to isolate or culture from patient samples . "
23,"Before becoming a conservative Republican, Ronald Reagan was ________.","Although many of his movie roles and the persona he created for himself seemed to represent traditional values , Reagan ’ s rise to the presidency was an unusual transition from pop cultural significance to political success . Born and raised in the Midwest , he moved to California in 1937 to become a Hollywood actor . He also became a reserve officer in the U . S . Army that same year , but when the country entered World War II , he was excluded from active duty overseas because of poor eyesight and spent the war in the army ’ s First Motion Picture Unit . After the war , he resumed his film career ; rose to leadership in the Screen Actors Guild , a Hollywood union ; and became a spokesman for General Electric and the host of a television series that the company sponsored .  As a young man , he identified politically as a liberal Democrat , but his distaste for communism , along with the influence of the social conservative values of his second wife , actress Nancy Davis , edged him closer to conservative Republicanism ( Figure 31.3 ) .  By 1962 , he had formally switched political parties , and in 1964 , he actively campaigned for the Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater ."
23,The belief that cutting taxes for the rich will eventually result in economic benefits for the poor is commonly referred to as ________.,"Reagan ’ s primary goal upon taking office was to stimulate the sagging economy while simultaneously cutting both government programs and taxes . His economic policies , called Reaganomics by the press , were based on a theory called supply-side economics , about which many economists were skeptical .  Influenced by economist Arthur Laffer of the University of Southern California , Reagan cut income taxes for those at the top of the economic ladder , which was supposed to motivate the rich to invest in businesses , factories , and the stock market in anticipation of high returns .   According to Laffer ’ s argument , this would eventually translate into more jobs further down the socioeconomic ladder .   Economic growth would also increase the total tax revenue — even at a lower tax rate .   In other words , proponents of “ trickle-down economics ” promised to cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time .  Reaganomics also included the deregulation of industry and higher interest rates to control inflation , but these initiatives preceded Reagan and were conceived in the Carter administration ."
23,Which statement best describes Reagan’s political style?,"Reagan was an articulate spokesman for his political perspectives and was able to garner support for his policies .  Often called “ The Great Communicator , ” he was noted for his ability , honed through years as an actor and spokesperson , to convey a mixture of folksy wisdom , empathy , and concern while taking humorous digs at his opponents .   Indeed , listening to Reagan speak often felt like hearing a favorite uncle recall stories about the “ good old days ” before big government , expensive social programs , and greedy politicians destroyed the country ( Figure 31.6 ) .   Americans found this rhetorical style extremely compelling .  Public support for the plan , combined with a surge in the president ’ s popularity after he survived an assassination attempt in March 1981 , swayed Congress , including many Democrats . On July 29 , 1981 , Congress passed the Economic Recovery Tax Act , which phased in a 25 percent overall reduction in taxes over a period of three years ."
23,What rationale did Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA movement cite when opposing the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment?,"Schlafly ’ s attack on the ERA was ingenious in its method and effectiveness . Rather than attacking the amendment directly as a gateway to unrestrained and immoral behavior as some had , she couched her opposition in language that was sensitive to both privilege and class .  Her instrument was the STOP ERA movement , with the acronym STOP , standing for “ Stop Taking our Privileges . ” Schlafly argued that women enjoyed special privileges such as gender-specific restrooms and exemption from the military draft .  These , she claimed , would be lost should the ERA be ratified . But she also claimed to stand up for the dignity of being a homemaker and lambasted the feminist movement as elitist . In this , she was keenly aware of the power of class interests . Her organization suggested that privileged women could afford to support the ERA . Working women and poor housewives , however , would ultimately bear the brunt of the loss of protection it would bring . In the end , her tactics were successful in achieving exactly what the movement ’ s name suggested ; she stopped the ERA .  Defining American Phyllis Schlafly and the STOP ERA Movement In 1972 , after a large number of states jumped to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment , most observers believed its ultimate ratification by all the necessary states was all but certain .  But , a decade later , the amendment died without ever getting the necessary votes . There are many reasons it went down in defeat , but a major one was Phyllis Schlafly ."
23,The group the Reagan administration encouraged and supported in its fight against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua was known as the ________.,"Neighboring Nicaragua was also governed by a largely Marxist-inspired group , the Sandinistas . This organization , led by Daniel Ortega , had overthrown the brutal , right-wing dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979 . Reagan , however , overlooked the legitimate complaints of the Sandinistas and believed that their rule opened the region to Cuban and Soviet influence .  A year into his presidency , convinced it was folly to allow the expansion of Soviet and Communist influence in Latin America , he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to equip and train a group of anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans known as the Contras ( contrarevolucionários or “ counter-revolutionaries ” ) to oust Ortega . "
23,The country that Iraq invaded to trigger the crisis that resulted in the Persian Gulf War was ________.,"In response to the invasion , Bush and his foreign policy team forged an unprecedented international coalition of thirty-four countries , including many members of NATO ( North Atlantic Treaty Organization ) and the Middle Eastern countries of Saudi Arabia , Syria , and Egypt , to oppose Iraqi aggression . Bush hoped that this coalition would herald the beginning of a “ new world order ” in which the nations of the world would work together to deter belligerence . A deadline was set for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait by January 15 , or face serious consequences . Wary of not having sufficient domestic support for combat , Bush first deployed troops to the area to build up forces in the region and defend Saudi Arabia via Operation Desert Shield ( Figure 31.13 ) .  On January 14 , Bush succeeded in getting resolutions from Congress authorizing the use of military force against Iraq , and the U . S . then orchestrated an effective air campaign , followed by Operation Desert Storm , a one-hundred-hour land war involving over 500,000 U . S . troops and another 200,000 from twenty-seven other countries , which expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait by the end of February .  As the Soviet Union was ceasing to be a threat , the Middle East became a source of increased concern . In the wake of its eight-year war with Iran from 1980 to 1988 , Iraq had accumulated a significant amount of foreign debt . At the same time , other Arab states had increased their oil production , forcing oil prices down and further hurting Iraq ’ s economy . Iraq ’ s leader , Saddam Hussein , approached these oil-producing states for assistance , particularly Saudi Arabia and neighboring Kuwait , which Iraq felt directly benefited from its war with Iran .  When talks with these countries broke down , and Iraq found itself politically and economically isolated , Hussein ordered the invasion of oil-rich Kuwait in August 1990 .   Bush faced his first full-scale international crisis . "
23,"Bill Clinton helped create a large free market among Canada, the United States, and Mexico with ratification of the ________ treaty."," Clinton also strongly supported ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , a treaty that eliminated tariffs and trade restrictions among the United States , Canada , and Mexico .  The treaty had been negotiated by the Bush administration , and the leaders of all three nations had signed it in December 1992 . However , because of strong opposition from American labor unions and some in Congress who feared the loss of jobs to Mexico , the treaty had not been ratified by the time Clinton took office . To allay the concerns of unions , he added an agreement to protect workers and also one to protect the environment . Congress ratified NAFTA late in 1993 . The result was the creation of the world ’ s largest common market in terms of population , including some 425 million people ."
23,The key state in the 2000 election where the U.S. Supreme Court stopped a recount of votes was ________.,"Because there seemed to be irregularities in four counties traditionally dominated by Democrats , especially in largely African American precincts , Gore called for a recount of the ballots by hand . Florida ’ s secretary of state , Katherine Harris , set a deadline for the new vote tallies to be submitted , a deadline the counties could not meet . When the Democrats requested an extension , the Florida Supreme Court granted it , but Harris refused to accept the new tallies unless the counties could explain why they had not met the original deadline . When the explanations were submitted , they were rejected . Gore then asked the Florida Supreme Court for an injunction that would prevent Harris from declaring a winner until the recount was finished . On November 26 , Harris declared Bush the winner in Florida . Gore protested that not all votes had been recounted by hand .  When the Florida Supreme Court ordered the recount to continue , the Republicans appealed to the U . S . Supreme Court , which decided 5 – 4 to stop the recount .  Bush received Florida ’ s electoral votes and , with a total of 271 votes in the Electoral College to Gore ’ s 266 , became the forty-third president of the United States .  One hundred million votes were cast in the 2000 election , and Gore topped Bush in the popular vote by 540,000 ballots , or 0.5 percent .  The race was so close that news reports declared each candidate the winner at various times during the evening . It all came down to Florida , where early returns called the election in Bush ’ s favor by a mere 527 of 5,825 , 000 votes . Whoever won Florida would get the state ’ s twenty-five electoral votes and secure the presidency ( Figure 31.20 ) ."
24,Which of these organs is not considered an accessory digestive structure?," In this section , you will examine the anatomy and functions of the three main organs of the upper alimentary canal — the mouth , pharynx , and esophagus — as well as three associated accessory organs — the tongue , salivary glands , and teeth .   Each accessory digestive organ aids in the breakdown of food ( Figure 23.3 ) .   Within the mouth , the teeth and tongue begin mechanical digestion , whereas the salivary glands begin chemical digestion .   Once food products enter the small intestine , the gallbladder , liver , and pancreas release secretions — such as bile and enzymes — essential for digestion to continue .   Together , these are called accessory organs because they sprout from the lining cells of the developing gut ( mucosa ) and augment its function ; indeed , you could not live without their vital contributions , and many significant diseases result from their malfunction .  Even after development is complete , they maintain a connection to the gut by way of ducts ."
24,Which of the following organs is supported by a layer of adventitia rather than serosa?,"The mucosa of the esophagus is made up of an epithelial lining that contains non-keratinized , stratified squamous epithelium , with a layer of basal and parabasal cells . This epithelium protects against erosion from food particles . The mucosa ’ s lamina propria contains mucus-secreting glands . The muscularis layer changes according to location : In the upper third of the esophagus , the muscularis is skeletal muscle . In the middle third , it is both skeletal and smooth muscle . In the lower third , it is smooth muscle .  As mentioned previously , the most superficial layer of the esophagus is called the adventitia , not the serosa .  In contrast to the stomach and intestines , the loose connective tissue of the adventitia is not covered by a fold of visceral peritoneum . The digestive functions of the esophagus are identified in Table 23.5 ."
24,Which of the following membranes covers the stomach?,"The mucosa of the esophagus is made up of an epithelial lining that contains non-keratinized , stratified squamous epithelium , with a layer of basal and parabasal cells . This epithelium protects against erosion from food particles . The mucosa ’ s lamina propria contains mucus-secreting glands . The muscularis layer changes according to location : In the upper third of the esophagus , the muscularis is skeletal muscle . In the middle third , it is both skeletal and smooth muscle . In the lower third , it is smooth muscle . As mentioned previously , the most superficial layer of the esophagus is called the adventitia , not the serosa .  In contrast to the stomach and intestines , the loose connective tissue of the adventitia is not covered by a fold of visceral peritoneum .  The digestive functions of the esophagus are identified in Table 23.5 . The Peritoneum The digestive organs within the abdominal cavity are held in place by the peritoneum , a broad serous membranous sac made up of squamous epithelial tissue surrounded by connective tissue .  It is composed of two different regions : the parietal peritoneum , which lines the abdominal wall , and the visceral peritoneum , which envelopes the abdominal organs ( Figure 23.4 ) .  The peritoneal cavity is the space bounded by the visceral and parietal peritoneal surfaces . A few milliliters of watery fluid act as a lubricant to minimize friction between the serosal surfaces of the peritoneum ."
24,Which of these processes occurs in the mouth?," In chemical digestion , starting in the mouth , digestive secretions break down complex food molecules into their chemical building blocks ( for example , proteins into separate amino acids ) .  These secretions vary in composition , but typically contain water , various enzymes , acids , and salts . The process is completed in the small intestine . Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes . Mechanical digestion is a purely physical process that does not change the chemical nature of the food . Instead , it makes the food smaller to increase both surface area and mobility . It includes mastication , or chewing , as well as tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix food with saliva .  Although there may be a tendency to think that mechanical digestion is limited to the first steps of the digestive process , it occurs after the food leaves the mouth , as well .  The mechanical churning of food in the stomach serves to further break it apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices , creating an acidic “ soup ” called chyme . Segmentation , which occurs mainly in the small intestine , consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the muscularis layer of the alimentary canal . These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine , moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing , breaking up , and mixing the contents . By moving food back and forth in the intestinal lumen , segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption .  The first of these processes , ingestion , refers to the entry of food into the alimentary canal through the mouth .  There , the food is chewed and mixed with saliva , which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates in the food plus some lipid digestion via lingual lipase . Chewing increases the surface area of the food and allows an appropriately sized bolus to be produced ."
24,Which structure is located where the esophagus penetrates the diaphragm?,"The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the pharynx to the stomach . It is approximately 25.4 cm ( 10 in ) in length , located posterior to the trachea , and remains in a collapsed form when not engaged in swallowing . As you can see in Figure 23.13 , the esophagus runs a mainly straight route through the mediastinum of the thorax .  To enter the abdomen , the esophagus penetrates the diaphragm through an opening called the esophageal hiatus . "
24,Which phase of deglutition involves contraction of the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis?," The entry of food into the esophagus marks the beginning of the esophageal phase of deglutition and the initiation of peristalsis .  As in the previous phase , the complex neuromuscular actions are controlled by the medulla oblongata . Peristalsis propels the bolus through the esophagus and toward the stomach .  The circular muscle layer of the muscularis contracts , pinching the esophageal wall and forcing the bolus forward .   At the same time , the longitudinal muscle layer of the muscularis also contracts , shortening this area and pushing out its walls to receive the bolus .  In this way , a series of contractions keeps moving food toward the stomach . When the bolus nears the stomach , distention of the esophagus initiates a short reflex relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter that allows the bolus to pass into the stomach . During the esophageal phase , esophageal glands secrete mucus that lubricates the bolus and minimizes friction ."
24,Which of these cells secrete hormones?," Enteroendocrine cells — Finally , enteroendocrine cells found in the gastric glands secrete various hormones into the interstitial fluid of the lamina propria .  These include gastrin , which is released mainly by enteroendocrine G cells ."
24,Where does the majority of chemical digestion in the stomach occur?,"Although the walls of the gastric pits are made up primarily of mucus cells , the gastric glands are made up of different types of cells . The glands of the cardia and pylorus are composed primarily of mucus-secreting cells . Cells that make up the pyloric antrum secrete mucus and a number of hormones , including the majority of the stimulatory hormone , gastrin .  The much larger glands of the fundus and body of the stomach , the site of most chemical digestion , produce most of the gastric secretions .  These glands are made up of a variety of secretory cells . These include parietal cells , chief cells , mucous neck cells , and enteroendocrine cells ."
24,"During gastric emptying, chyme is released into the duodenum through the ________.","Within a few moments after food enters your stomach , mixing waves begin to occur at intervals of approximately 20 seconds . A mixing wave is a unique type of peristalsis that mixes and softens the food with gastric juices to create chyme . The initial mixing waves are relatively gentle , but these are followed by more intense waves , starting at the body of the stomach and increasing in force as they reach the pylorus . It is fair to say that long before your sushi exits through the pyloric sphincter , it bears little resemblance to the sushi you ate . The pylorus , which holds around 30 mL ( 1 fluid ounce ) of chyme , acts as a filter , permitting only liquids and small food particles to pass through the mostly , but not fully , closed pyloric sphincter .  In a process called gastric emptying , rhythmic mixing waves force about 3 mL of chyme at a time through the pyloric sphincter and into the duodenum .  Release of a greater amount of chyme at one time would overwhelm the capacity of the small intestine to handle it . The rest of the chyme is pushed back into the body of the stomach , where it continues mixing . This process is repeated when the next mixing waves force more chyme into the duodenum ."
24,Parietal cells secrete ________.,"A variety of hormones are involved in the digestive process . The main digestive hormone of the stomach is gastrin , which is secreted in response to the presence of food .  Gastrin stimulates the secretion of gastric acid by the parietal cells of the stomach mucosa .  Other GI hormones are produced and act upon the gut and its accessory organs . Hormones produced by the duodenum include secretin , which stimulates a watery secretion of bicarbonate by the pancreas ; cholecystokinin ( CCK ) , which stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile from the liver and release of bile from the gallbladder ; and gastric inhibitory peptide , which inhibits gastric secretion and slows gastric emptying and motility . These GI hormones are secreted by specialized epithelial cells , called endocrinocytes , located in the mucosal epithelium of the stomach and small intestine . These hormones then enter the bloodstream , through which they can reach their target organs . 23.3 The Mouth , Pharynx , and Esophagus Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
24,In which part of the alimentary canal does most digestion occur?," Chyme released from the stomach enters the small intestine , which is the primary digestive organ in the body .   Not only is this where most digestion occurs , it is also where practically all absorption occurs .  The longest part of the alimentary canal , the small intestine is about 3.05 meters ( 10 feet ) long in a living person ( but about twice as long in a cadaver due to the loss of muscle tone ) . Since this makes it about five times longer than the large intestine , you might wonder why it is called “ small . ” In fact , its name derives from its relatively smaller diameter of only about 2.54 cm ( 1 in ) , compared with 7.62 cm ( 3 in ) for the large intestine . As we ’ ll see shortly , in addition to its length , the folds and projections of the lining of the small intestine work to give it an enormous surface area , which is approximately 200 m 2 , more than 100 times the surface area of your skin . This large surface area is necessary for complex processes of digestion and absorption that occur within it ."
24,What is the role of the small intestine’s MALT?,"The lamina propria of the small intestine mucosa is studded with quite a bit of MALT .  In addition to solitary lymphatic nodules , aggregations of intestinal MALT , which are typically referred to as Peyer ’ s patches , are concentrated in the distal ileum , and serve to keep bacteria from entering the bloodstream .  Peyer ’ s patches are most prominent in young people and become less distinct as you age , which coincides with the general activity of our immune system ."
24,Which part of the large intestine attaches to the appendix?,"The first part of the large intestine is the cecum , a sac-like structure that is suspended inferior to the ileocecal valve . It is about 6 cm ( 2.4 in ) long , receives the contents of the ileum , and continues the absorption of water and salts .  The appendix ( or vermiform appendix ) is a winding tube that attaches to the cecum .  Although the 7.6- cm ( 3 - in ) long appendix contains lymphoid tissue , suggesting an immunologic function , this organ is generally considered vestigial . However , at least one recent report postulates a survival advantage conferred by the appendix : In diarrheal illness , the appendix may serve as a bacterial reservoir to repopulate the enteric bacteria for those surviving the initial phases of the illness . Moreover , its twisted anatomy provides a haven for the accumulation and multiplication of enteric bacteria . The mesoappendix , the mesentery of the appendix , tethers it to the mesentery of the ileum ."
24,Which of these statements about bile is true?,"Hepatocytes secrete about one liter of bile each day . A yellow-brown or yellow-green alkaline solution ( pH 7.6 to 8.6 ) , bile is a mixture of water , bile salts , bile pigments , phospholipids ( such as lecithin ) , electrolytes , cholesterol , and triglycerides . The components most critical to emulsification are bile salts and phospholipids , which have a nonpolar ( hydrophobic ) region as well as a polar ( hydrophilic ) region . The hydrophobic region interacts with the large lipid molecules , whereas the hydrophilic region interacts with the watery chyme in the intestine . This results in the large lipid globules being pulled apart into many tiny lipid fragments of about 1 µ m in diameter . This change dramatically increases the surface area available for lipid-digesting enzyme activity . This is the same way dish soap works on fats mixed with water . Bile salts act as emulsifying agents , so they are also important for the absorption of digested lipids .  While most constituents of bile are eliminated in feces , bile salts are reclaimed by the enterohepatic circulation .  Once bile salts reach the ileum , they are absorbed and returned to the liver in the hepatic portal blood . The hepatocytes then excrete the bile salts into newly formed bile .  Thus , this precious resource is recycled . "
24,Pancreatic juice ________.,"The pancreas produces over a liter of pancreatic juice each day . Unlike bile , it is clear and composed mostly of water along with some salts , sodium bicarbonate , and several digestive enzymes .  Sodium bicarbonate is responsible for the slight alkalinity of pancreatic juice ( pH 7.1 to 8.2 ) , which serves to buffer the acidic gastric juice in chyme , inactivate pepsin from the stomach , and create an optimal environment for the activity of pH-sensitive digestive enzymes in the small intestine .  Pancreatic enzymes are active in the digestion of sugars , proteins , and fats . The pancreas produces protein-digesting enzymes in their inactive forms . These enzymes are activated in the duodenum . If produced in an active form , they would digest the pancreas ( which is exactly what occurs in the disease , pancreatitis ) . The intestinal brush border enzyme enteropeptidase stimulates the activation of trypsin from trypsinogen of the pancreas , which in turn changes the pancreatic enzymes procarboxypeptidase and chymotrypsinogen into their active forms , carboxypeptidase and chymotrypsin ."
24,Where does the chemical digestion of starch begin?, The chemical digestion of starches begins in the mouth and has been reviewed above . 
24,Which of these is involved in the chemical digestion of protein?," The digestion of protein starts in the stomach , where HCl and pepsin break proteins into smaller polypeptides , which then travel to the small intestine ( Figure 23.30 ) .   Chemical digestion in the small intestine is continued by pancreatic enzymes , including chymotrypsin and trypsin , each of which act on specific bonds in amino acid sequences .  At the same time , the cells of the brush border secrete enzymes such as aminopeptidase and dipeptidase , which further break down peptide chains . This results in molecules small enough to enter the bloodstream ( Figure 23.31 ) ."
24,Which of these nutrients is absorbed mainly in the duodenum?,"In general , all minerals that enter the intestine are absorbed , whether you need them or not .  Iron and calcium are exceptions ; they are absorbed in the duodenum in amounts that meet the body ’ s current requirements , as follows : "
25,Muscle that has a striped appearance is described as being ________.,"Differences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins — actin and myosin .  The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells ( referred to as fibers ) in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle , which creates a pattern , or stripes , called striations .  The striations are visible with a light microscope under high magnification ( see Figure 10.2 ) . Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated structures that compose the skeletal muscle . Cardiac muscle fibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as one unit ( called a syncytium ) . Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle , the cytoplasm of a smooth muscle fiber ( which has only a single nucleus ) has a uniform , nonstriated appearance ( resulting in the name smooth muscle ) . However , the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less efficient . Smooth muscle in the walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to push blood through the circulatory system ; and smooth muscle in the skin , visceral organs , and internal passageways is essential for moving all materials through the body . 10.2 Skeletal Muscle Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
25,Which element is important in directly triggering contraction?, The release of calcium ions initiates muscle contractions .  Watch this video to learn more about the role of calcium . ( a ) What are “ T-tubules ” and what is their role ? ( b ) Please describe how actin-binding sites are made available for cross-bridging with myosin heads during contraction .
25,Which of the following properties is not common to all three muscle tissues?," A muscle can return to its original length when relaxed due to a quality of muscle tissue called elasticity .  It can recoil back to its original length due to elastic fibers . Muscle tissue also has the quality of extensibility ; it can stretch or extend . Contractility allows muscle tissue to pull on its attachment points and shorten with force . Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body , and the body contains three types of muscle tissue : skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle , and smooth muscle ( Figure 10.2 ) .  All three muscle tissues have some properties in common ; they all exhibit a quality called excitability as their plasma membranes can change their electrical states ( from polarized to depolarized ) and send an electrical wave called an action potential along the entire length of the membrane .  While the nervous system can influence the excitability of cardiac and smooth muscle to some degree , skeletal muscle completely depends on signaling from the nervous system to work properly . On the other hand , both cardiac muscle and smooth muscle can respond to other stimuli , such as hormones and local stimuli . The muscles all begin the actual process of contracting ( shortening ) when a protein called actin is pulled by a protein called myosin . This occurs in striated muscle ( skeletal and cardiac ) after specific binding sites on the actin have been exposed in response to the interaction between calcium ions ( Ca + + ) and proteins ( troponin and tropomyosin ) that “ shield ” the actin-binding sites . Ca + + also is required for the contraction of smooth muscle , although its role is different : here Ca + + activates enzymes , which in turn activate myosin heads .  All muscles require adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to continue the process of contracting , and they all relax when the Ca + + is removed and the actin-binding sites are re-shielded . "
25,The correct order for the smallest to the largest unit of organization in muscle tissue is ________.," The sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber .   The sarcomere itself is bundled within the myofibril that runs the entire length of the muscle fiber and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end .  As myofibrils contract , the entire muscle cell contracts . Because myofibrils are only approximately 1.2 μ m in diameter , hundreds to thousands ( each with thousands of sarcomeres ) can be found inside one muscle fiber . Each sarcomere is approximately 2 μ m in length with a three-dimensional cylinder-like arrangement and is bordered by structures called Z-discs ( also called Z-lines , because pictures are two-dimensional ) , to which the actin myofilaments are anchored ( Figure 10.5 ) . Because the actin and its troponin-tropomyosin complex ( projecting from the Z-discs toward the center of the sarcomere ) form strands that are thinner than the myosin , it is called the thin filament of the sarcomere . Likewise , because the myosin strands and their multiple heads ( projecting from the center of the sarcomere , toward but not all to way to , the Z-discs ) have more mass and are thicker , they are called the thick filament of the sarcomere . Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical , they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers . Skeletal muscle fibers can be quite large for human cells , with diameters up to 100 μ m and lengths up to 30 cm ( 11.8 in ) in the Sartorius of the upper leg . During early development , embryonic myoblasts , each with its own nucleus , fuse with up to hundreds of other myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers . Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes , permitting the production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle contraction . Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek sarco , which means “ flesh . ” The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called the sarcolemma , the cytoplasm is referred to as sarcoplasm , and the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum , which stores , releases , and retrieves calcium ions ( Ca + + ) is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) ( Figure 10.4 ) .  As will soon be described , the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber is the sarcomere , a highly organized arrangement of the contractile myofilaments actin ( thin filament ) and myosin ( thick filament ) , along with other support proteins .  Each skeletal muscle is an organ that consists of various integrated tissues . These tissues include the skeletal muscle fibers , blood vessels , nerve fibers , and connective tissue . Each skeletal muscle has three layers of connective tissue ( called “ mysia ” ) that enclose it and provide structure to the muscle as a whole , and also compartmentalize the muscle fibers within the muscle ( Figure 10.3 ) . Each muscle is wrapped in a sheath of dense , irregular connective tissue called the epimysium , which allows a muscle to contract and move powerfully while maintaining its structural integrity . The epimysium also separates muscle from other tissues and organs in the area , allowing the muscle to move independently .  Inside each skeletal muscle , muscle fibers are organized into individual bundles , each called a fascicle , by a middle layer of connective tissue called the perimysium .  This fascicular organization is common in muscles of the limbs ; it allows the nervous system to trigger a specific movement of a muscle by activating a subset of muscle fibers within a bundle , or fascicle of the muscle . Inside each fascicle , each muscle fiber is encased in a thin connective tissue layer of collagen and reticular fibers called the endomysium . The endomysium contains the extracellular fluid and nutrients to support the muscle fiber . These nutrients are supplied via blood to the muscle tissue ."
25,Depolarization of the sarcolemma means ________.,"All living cells have membrane potentials , or electrical gradients across their membranes . The inside of the membrane is usually around - 60 to - 90 mV , relative to the outside . This is referred to as a cell ’ s membrane potential . Neurons and muscle cells can use their membrane potentials to generate electrical signals . They do this by controlling the movement of charged particles , called ions , across their membranes to create electrical currents . This is achieved by opening and closing specialized proteins in the membrane called ion channels . Although the currents generated by ions moving through these channel proteins are very small , they form the basis of both neural signaling and muscle contraction . Both neurons and skeletal muscle cells are electrically excitable , meaning that they are able to generate action potentials . An action potential is a special type of electrical signal that can travel along a cell membrane as a wave . This allows a signal to be transmitted quickly and faithfully over long distances . Although the term excitation-contraction coupling confuses or scares some students , it comes down to this : for a skeletal muscle fiber to contract , its membrane must first be “ excited ” — in other words , it must be stimulated to fire an action potential . The muscle fiber action potential , which sweeps along the sarcolemma as a wave , is “ coupled ” to the actual contraction through the release of calcium ions ( Ca + + ) from the SR . Once released , the Ca + + interacts with the shielding proteins , forcing them to move aside so that the actin-binding sites are available for attachment by myosin heads . The myosin then pulls the actin filaments toward the center , shortening the muscle fiber . In skeletal muscle , this sequence begins with signals from the somatic motor division of the nervous system . In other words , the “ excitation ” step in skeletal muscles is always triggered by signaling from the nervous system ( Figure 10.6 ) . The motor neurons that tell the skeletal muscle fibers to contract originate in the spinal cord , with a smaller number located in the brainstem for activation of skeletal muscles of the face , head , and neck . These neurons have long processes , called axons , which are specialized to transmit action potentials long distances — in this case , all the way from the spinal cord to the muscle itself ( which may be up to three feet away ) . The axons of multiple neurons bundle together to form nerves , like wires bundled together in a cable . Signaling begins when a neuronal action potential travels along the axon of a motor neuron , and then along the individual branches to terminate at the NMJ . At the NMJ , the axon terminal releases a chemical messenger , or neurotransmitter , called acetylcholine ( ACh ) .  The ACh molecules diffuse across a minute space called the synaptic cleft and bind to ACh receptors located within the motor end-plate of the sarcolemma on the other side of the synapse .   Once ACh binds , a channel in the ACh receptor opens and positively charged ions can pass through into the muscle fiber , causing it to depolarize , meaning that the membrane potential of the muscle fiber becomes less negative ( closer to zero . )   As the membrane depolarizes , another set of ion channels called voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered to open .  Sodium ions enter the muscle fiber , and an action potential rapidly spreads ( or “ fires ” ) along the entire membrane to initiate excitation-contraction coupling . Things happen very quickly in the world of excitable membranes ( just think about how quickly you can snap your fingers as soon as you decide to do it ) . Immediately following depolarization of the membrane , it repolarizes , re-establishing the negative membrane potential . Meanwhile , the ACh in the synaptic cleft is degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) so that the ACh cannot rebind to a receptor and reopen its channel , which would cause unwanted extended muscle excitation and contraction . Propagation of an action potential along the sarcolemma is the excitation portion of excitation-contraction coupling . Recall that this excitation actually triggers the release of calcium ions ( Ca + + ) from its storage in the cell ’ s SR . For the action potential to reach the membrane of the SR , there are periodic invaginations in the sarcolemma , called T-tubules ( “ T ” stands for “ transverse ” ) . You will recall that the diameter of a muscle fiber can be up to 100 μ m , so these T-tubules ensure that the membrane can get close to the SR in the sarcoplasm . The arrangement of a T-tubule with the membranes of SR on either side is called a triad ( Figure 10.7 ) . The triad surrounds the cylindrical structure called a myofibril , which contains actin and myosin . The T-tubules carry the action potential into the interior of the cell , which triggers the opening of calcium channels in the membrane of the adjacent SR , causing Ca + + to diffuse out of the SR and into the sarcoplasm . It is the arrival of Ca + + in the sarcoplasm that initiates contraction of the muscle fiber by its contractile units , or sarcomeres . 10.3 Muscle Fiber Contraction and Relaxation Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
25,"In relaxed muscle, the myosin-binding site on actin is blocked by ________.", Tropomyosin is a protein that winds around the chains of the actin filament and covers the myosin-binding sites to prevent actin from binding to myosin .  Tropomyosin binds to troponin to form a troponin-tropomyosin complex . The troponin-tropomyosin complex prevents the myosin “ heads ” from binding to the active sites on the actin microfilaments . Troponin also has a binding site for Ca + + ions .
25,"According to the sliding filament model, binding sites on actin open when ________.","When signaled by a motor neuron , a skeletal muscle fiber contracts as the thin filaments are pulled and then slide past the thick filaments within the fiber ’ s sarcomeres .  This process is known as the sliding filament model of muscle contraction ( Figure 10.10 ) .   The sliding can only occur when myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments are exposed by a series of steps that begins with Ca + + entry into the sarcoplasm . "
25,The cell membrane of a muscle fiber is called ________.,"Because skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical , they are commonly referred to as muscle fibers . Skeletal muscle fibers can be quite large for human cells , with diameters up to 100 μ m and lengths up to 30 cm ( 11.8 in ) in the Sartorius of the upper leg . During early development , embryonic myoblasts , each with its own nucleus , fuse with up to hundreds of other myoblasts to form the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers . Multiple nuclei mean multiple copies of genes , permitting the production of the large amounts of proteins and enzymes needed for muscle contraction .  Some other terminology associated with muscle fibers is rooted in the Greek sarco , which means “ flesh . ” The plasma membrane of muscle fibers is called the sarcolemma , the cytoplasm is referred to as sarcoplasm , and the specialized smooth endoplasmic reticulum , which stores , releases , and retrieves calcium ions ( Ca + + ) is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) ( Figure 10.4 ) .  As will soon be described , the functional unit of a skeletal muscle fiber is the sarcomere , a highly organized arrangement of the contractile myofilaments actin ( thin filament ) and myosin ( thick filament ) , along with other support proteins ."
25,Muscle relaxation occurs when ________.,"A single action potential from a motor neuron will produce a single contraction in the muscle fibers of its motor unit . This isolated contraction is called a twitch . A twitch can last for a few milliseconds or 100 milliseconds , depending on the muscle type . The tension produced by a single twitch can be measured by a myogram , an instrument that measures the amount of tension produced over time ( Figure 10.15 ) . Each twitch undergoes three phases . The first phase is the latent period , during which the action potential is being propagated along the sarcolemma and Ca + + ions are released from the SR . This is the phase during which excitation and contraction are being coupled but contraction has yet to occur . The contraction phase occurs next . The Ca + + ions in the sarcoplasm have bound to troponin , tropomyosin has shifted away from actin-binding sites , cross-bridges formed , and sarcomeres are actively shortening to the point of peak tension .  The last phase is the relaxation phase , when tension decreases as contraction stops .   Ca + + ions are pumped out of the sarcoplasm into the SR , and cross-bridge cycling stops , returning the muscle fibers to their resting state . "
25,"During muscle contraction, the cross-bridge detaches when ________.","To initiate muscle contraction , tropomyosin has to expose the myosin-binding site on an actin filament to allow cross-bridge formation between the actin and myosin microfilaments .  The first step in the process of contraction is for Ca + + to bind to troponin so that tropomyosin can slide away from the binding sites on the actin strands .   This allows the myosin heads to bind to these exposed binding sites and form cross-bridges .  The thin filaments are then pulled by the myosin heads to slide past the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere . But each head can only pull a very short distance before it has reached its limit and must be “ re-cocked ” before it can pull again , a step that requires ATP ."
25,Thin and thick filaments are organized into functional units called ________.,"The sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber . The sarcomere itself is bundled within the myofibril that runs the entire length of the muscle fiber and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end . As myofibrils contract , the entire muscle cell contracts . Because myofibrils are only approximately 1.2 μ m in diameter , hundreds to thousands ( each with thousands of sarcomeres ) can be found inside one muscle fiber . Each sarcomere is approximately 2 μ m in length with a three-dimensional cylinder-like arrangement and is bordered by structures called Z-discs ( also called Z-lines , because pictures are two-dimensional ) , to which the actin myofilaments are anchored ( Figure 10.5 ) .  Because the actin and its troponin-tropomyosin complex ( projecting from the Z-discs toward the center of the sarcomere ) form strands that are thinner than the myosin , it is called the thin filament of the sarcomere .   Likewise , because the myosin strands and their multiple heads ( projecting from the center of the sarcomere , toward but not all to way to , the Z-discs ) have more mass and are thicker , they are called the thick filament of the sarcomere . "
25,During which phase of a twitch in a muscle fiber is tension the greatest?,"A single action potential from a motor neuron will produce a single contraction in the muscle fibers of its motor unit . This isolated contraction is called a twitch . A twitch can last for a few milliseconds or 100 milliseconds , depending on the muscle type . The tension produced by a single twitch can be measured by a myogram , an instrument that measures the amount of tension produced over time ( Figure 10.15 ) .  Each twitch undergoes three phases .  The first phase is the latent period , during which the action potential is being propagated along the sarcolemma and Ca + + ions are released from the SR . This is the phase during which excitation and contraction are being coupled but contraction has yet to occur .  The contraction phase occurs next .   The Ca + + ions in the sarcoplasm have bound to troponin , tropomyosin has shifted away from actin-binding sites , cross-bridges formed , and sarcomeres are actively shortening to the point of peak tension .  The last phase is the relaxation phase , when tension decreases as contraction stops . Ca + + ions are pumped out of the sarcoplasm into the SR , and cross-bridge cycling stops , returning the muscle fibers to their resting state ."
25,Muscle fatigue is caused by ________.,"As the ATP produced by creatine phosphate is depleted , muscles turn to glycolysis as an ATP source . Glycolysis is an anaerobic ( non-oxygen-dependent ) process that breaks down glucose ( sugar ) to produce ATP ; however , glycolysis cannot generate ATP as quickly as creatine phosphate . Thus , the switch to glycolysis results in a slower rate of ATP availability to the muscle . The sugar used in glycolysis can be provided by blood glucose or by metabolizing glycogen that is stored in the muscle . The breakdown of one glucose molecule produces two ATP and two molecules of pyruvic acid , which can be used in aerobic respiration or when oxygen levels are low , converted to lactic acid ( Figure 10.12 b ) . If oxygen is available , pyruvic acid is used in aerobic respiration .  However , if oxygen is not available , pyruvic acid is converted to lactic acid , which may contribute to muscle fatigue .  This conversion allows the recycling of the enzyme NAD + from NADH , which is needed for glycolysis to continue .  This occurs during strenuous exercise when high amounts of energy are needed but oxygen cannot be sufficiently delivered to muscle .  Glycolysis itself cannot be sustained for very long ( approximately 1 minute of muscle activity ) , but it is useful in facilitating short bursts of high-intensity output .  This is because glycolysis does not utilize glucose very efficiently , producing a net gain of two ATPs per molecule of glucose , and the end product of lactic acid , which may contribute to muscle fatigue as it accumulates . "
25,A sprinter would experience muscle fatigue sooner than a marathon runner due to ________.," The proportion of SO muscle fibers in muscle determines the suitability of that muscle for endurance , and may benefit those participating in endurance activities .  Postural muscles have a large number of SO fibers and relatively few FO and FG fibers , to keep the back straight ( Figure 10.18 ) .  Endurance athletes , like marathon-runners also would benefit from a larger proportion of SO fibers , but it is unclear if the most-successful marathoners are those with naturally high numbers of SO fibers , or whether the most successful marathon runners develop high numbers of SO fibers with repetitive training .  Endurance training can result in overuse injuries such as stress fractures and joint and tendon inflammation . Two criteria to consider when classifying the types of muscle fibers are how fast some fibers contract relative to others , and how fibers produce ATP . Using these criteria , there are three main types of skeletal muscle fibers .  Slow oxidative ( SO ) fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration ( oxygen and glucose ) to produce ATP .   Fast oxidative ( FO ) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration , but because they may switch to anaerobic respiration ( glycolysis ) , can fatigue more quickly than SO fibers .  Lastly , fast glycolytic ( FG ) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use anaerobic glycolysis . The FG fibers fatigue more quickly than the others . Most skeletal muscles in a human contain ( s ) all three types , although in varying proportions ."
25,What aspect of creatine phosphate allows it to supply energy to muscles?,"ATP supplies the energy for muscle contraction to take place . In addition to its direct role in the cross-bridge cycle , ATP also provides the energy for the active-transport Ca + + pumps in the SR . Muscle contraction does not occur without sufficient amounts of ATP . The amount of ATP stored in muscle is very low , only sufficient to power a few seconds worth of contractions . As it is broken down , ATP must therefore be regenerated and replaced quickly to allow for sustained contraction . There are three mechanisms by which ATP can be regenerated : creatine phosphate metabolism , anaerobic glycolysis , and fermentation and aerobic respiration .  Creatine phosphate is a molecule that can store energy in its phosphate bonds .  In a resting muscle , excess ATP transfers its energy to creatine , producing ADP and creatine phosphate . This acts as an energy reserve that can be used to quickly create more ATP . When the muscle starts to contract and needs energy , creatine phosphate transfers its phosphate back to ADP to form ATP and creatine . This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase and occurs very quickly ; thus , creatine phosphate-derived ATP powers the first few seconds of muscle contraction . However , creatine phosphate can only provide approximately 15 seconds worth of energy , at which point another energy source has to be used ( Figure 10.12 ) ."
25,Which of the following statements is true?," FG fibers primarily use anaerobic glycolysis as their ATP source .   They have a large diameter and possess high amounts of glycogen , which is used in glycolysis to generate ATP quickly to produce high levels of tension .  Because they do not primarily use aerobic metabolism , they do not possess substantial numbers of mitochondria or significant amounts of myoglobin and therefore have a white color . FG fibers are used to produce rapid , forceful contractions to make quick , powerful movements . These fibers fatigue quickly , permitting them to only be used for short periods . Most muscles possess a mixture of each fiber type . The predominant fiber type in a muscle is determined by the primary function of the muscle . 10.6 Exercise and Muscle Performance Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to : Two criteria to consider when classifying the types of muscle fibers are how fast some fibers contract relative to others , and how fibers produce ATP . Using these criteria , there are three main types of skeletal muscle fibers . Slow oxidative ( SO ) fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration ( oxygen and glucose ) to produce ATP . Fast oxidative ( FO ) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration , but because they may switch to anaerobic respiration ( glycolysis ) , can fatigue more quickly than SO fibers .  Lastly , fast glycolytic ( FG ) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use anaerobic glycolysis .  The FG fibers fatigue more quickly than the others . Most skeletal muscles in a human contain ( s ) all three types , although in varying proportions ."
25,Which of the following statements is false?,"The oxidative fibers contain many more mitochondria than the glycolytic fibers , because aerobic metabolism , which uses oxygen ( O 2 ) in the metabolic pathway , occurs in the mitochondria .  The SO fibers possess a large number of mitochondria and are capable of contracting for longer periods because of the large amount of ATP they can produce , but they have a relatively small diameter and do not produce a large amount of tension .  SO fibers are extensively supplied with blood capillaries to supply O 2 from the red blood cells in the bloodstream .  The SO fibers also possess myoglobin , an O 2 - carrying molecule similar to O 2 - carrying hemoglobin in the red blood cells .  The myoglobin stores some of the needed O 2 within the fibers themselves ( and gives SO fibers their red color ) .  All of these features allow SO fibers to produce large quantities of ATP , which can sustain muscle activity without fatiguing for long periods of time . "
25,Cardiac muscles differ from skeletal muscles in that they ________.,"Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart . Highly coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood into the vessels of the circulatory system . Similar to skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle is striated and organized into sarcomeres , possessing the same banding organization as skeletal muscle ( Figure 10.21 ) .  However , cardiac muscle fibers are shorter than skeletal muscle fibers and usually contain only one nucleus , which is located in the central region of the cell .   Cardiac muscle fibers also possess many mitochondria and myoglobin , as ATP is produced primarily through aerobic metabolism .   Cardiac muscle fibers cells also are extensively branched and are connected to one another at their ends by intercalated discs .  An intercalated disc allows the cardiac muscle cells to contract in a wave-like pattern so that the heart can work as a pump ."
25,"If cardiac muscle cells were prevented from undergoing aerobic metabolism, they ultimately would ________.","Slow fibers are predominantly used in endurance exercises that require little force but involve numerous repetitions .  The aerobic metabolism used by slow-twitch fibers allows them to maintain contractions over long periods .  Endurance training modifies these slow fibers to make them even more efficient by producing more mitochondria to enable more aerobic metabolism and more ATP production . Endurance exercise can also increase the amount of myoglobin in a cell , as increased aerobic respiration increases the need for oxygen . Myoglobin is found in the sarcoplasm and acts as an oxygen storage supply for the mitochondria ."
25,Smooth muscles differ from skeletal and cardiac muscles in that they ________.," The sarcomere is the functional unit of the muscle fiber .   The sarcomere itself is bundled within the myofibril that runs the entire length of the muscle fiber and attaches to the sarcolemma at its end .  As myofibrils contract , the entire muscle cell contracts . Because myofibrils are only approximately 1.2 μ m in diameter , hundreds to thousands ( each with thousands of sarcomeres ) can be found inside one muscle fiber . Each sarcomere is approximately 2 μ m in length with a three-dimensional cylinder-like arrangement and is bordered by structures called Z-discs ( also called Z-lines , because pictures are two-dimensional ) , to which the actin myofilaments are anchored ( Figure 10.5 ) . Because the actin and its troponin-tropomyosin complex ( projecting from the Z-discs toward the center of the sarcomere ) form strands that are thinner than the myosin , it is called the thin filament of the sarcomere . Likewise , because the myosin strands and their multiple heads ( projecting from the center of the sarcomere , toward but not all to way to , the Z-discs ) have more mass and are thicker , they are called the thick filament of the sarcomere .  Differences among the three muscle types include the microscopic organization of their contractile proteins — actin and myosin .   The actin and myosin proteins are arranged very regularly in the cytoplasm of individual muscle cells ( referred to as fibers ) in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle , which creates a pattern , or stripes , called striations .  The striations are visible with a light microscope under high magnification ( see Figure 10.2 ) . Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated structures that compose the skeletal muscle . Cardiac muscle fibers each have one to two nuclei and are physically and electrically connected to each other so that the entire heart contracts as one unit ( called a syncytium ) .  Because the actin and myosin are not arranged in such regular fashion in smooth muscle , the cytoplasm of a smooth muscle fiber ( which has only a single nucleus ) has a uniform , nonstriated appearance ( resulting in the name smooth muscle ) .  However , the less organized appearance of smooth muscle should not be interpreted as less efficient . Smooth muscle in the walls of arteries is a critical component that regulates blood pressure necessary to push blood through the circulatory system ; and smooth muscle in the skin , visceral organs , and internal passageways is essential for moving all materials through the body . 10.2 Skeletal Muscle Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
25,From which embryonic cell type does muscle tissue develop?,"Because DMD is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin , it was thought that introducing healthy myoblasts into patients might be an effective treatment .  Myoblasts are the embryonic cells responsible for muscle development , and ideally , they would carry healthy genes that could produce the dystrophin needed for normal muscle contraction .  This approach has been largely unsuccessful in humans . A recent approach has involved attempting to boost the muscle ’ s production of utrophin , a protein similar to dystrophin that may be able to assume the role of dystrophin and prevent cellular damage from occurring . 10.4 Nervous System Control of Muscle Tension Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
25,Which cell type helps to repair injured muscle fibers?,"Although the number of muscle cells is set during development , satellite cells help to repair skeletal muscle cells . A satellite cell is similar to a myoblast because it is a type of stem cell ; however , satellite cells are incorporated into muscle cells and facilitate the protein synthesis required for repair and growth . These cells are located outside the sarcolemma and are stimulated to grow and fuse with muscle cells by growth factors that are released by muscle fibers under certain forms of stress .  Satellite cells can regenerate muscle fibers to a very limited extent , but they primarily help to repair damage in living cells .  If a cell is damaged to a greater extent than can be repaired by satellite cells , the muscle fibers are replaced by scar tissue in a process called fibrosis . Because scar tissue cannot contract , muscle that has sustained significant damage loses strength and cannot produce the same amount of power or endurance as it could before being damaged ."
26,"As a result of the Adams-Onís Treaty, the United States gained which territory from Spain?","In March 1818 , General Andrew Jackson , frustrated by his inability to punish Creek and Seminole raiders , pursued them across the international border into Spanish Florida . Under Jackson ’ s command , U . S . troops defeated the Creek and Seminole , occupied several Florida settlements , and executed two British citizens accused of acting against the United States . Outraged by the U . S . invasion of its territory , the Spanish government demanded that Jackson and his troops withdraw . In agreeing to the withdrawal , however , U . S . Secretary of State John Quincy Adams also offered to purchase the colony .  Realizing that conflict between the United States and the Creeks and Seminoles would continue , Spain opted to cede the Spanish colony to its northern neighbor .   The Adams-Onís Treaty , named for Adams and the Spanish ambassador , Luís de Onís , made the cession of Florida official while also setting the boundary between the United States and Mexico at the Sabine River ( Figure 11.7 ) .  In exchange , Adams gave up U . S . claims to lands west of the Sabine and forgave Spain ’ s $ 5 million debt to the United States ."
26,The Long Expedition established a short-lived republic in Texas known as ________.," In September 1836 , military hero Sam Houston was elected president of Texas , and , following the relentless logic of U . S . expansion , Texans voted in favor of annexation to the United States .   This had been the dream of many settlers in Texas all along .   They wanted to expand the United States west and saw Texas as the next logical step .  Slaveholders there , such as Sam Houston , William B . Travis and James Bowie ( the latter two of whom died at the Alamo ) , believed too in the destiny of slavery . Mindful of the vicious debates over Missouri that had led to talk of disunion and war , American politicians were reluctant to annex Texas or , indeed , even to recognize it as a sovereign nation .  Annexation would almost certainly mean war with Mexico , and the admission of a state with a large enslaved population , though permissible under the Missouri Compromise , would bring the issue of slavery once again to the fore .   Texas had no choice but to organize itself as the independent Lone Star Republic .  To protect itself from Mexican attempts to reclaim it , Texas sought and received recognition from France , Great Britain , Belgium , and the Netherlands . The United States did not officially recognize Texas as an independent nation until March 1837 , nearly a year after the final victory over the Mexican army at San Jacinto .  The citizens of Texas have long indulged the hope , that in the adjustment of the boundaries of the Spanish possessions in America , and of the territories of the United States , that they should be included within the limits of the latter .  The claims of the United States , long and strenuously urged , encouraged the hope . The recent [ Adams-Onís ] treaty between Spain and the United States of America has dissipated an illusion too long fondly cherished , and has roused the citizens of Texas . . . They have seen themselves . . . literally abandoned to the dominion of the crown of Spain and left a prey . . . to all those exactions which Spanish rapacity is fertile in devising . The citizens of Texas would have proved themselves unworthy of the age . . . unworthy of their ancestry , of the kindred of the republics of the American continent , could they have hesitated in this emergency . . . Spurning the fetters of colonial vassalage , disdaining to submit to the most atrocious despotism that ever disgraced the annals of Europe , they have resolved under the blessing of God to be free .  Defining American The Long Expedition ’ s Declaration of Independence The Long Expedition ’ s short-lived Republic of Texas was announced with the drafting of a Declaration of Independence in 1819 .  The declaration named settlers ’ grievances against the limits put on expansion by the Adams-Onís treaty and expressed their fears of Spain :"
26,A proposal to prohibit the importation of enslaved people to Missouri following its admission to the United States was made by ________.,"The debate about representation shifted to the morality of slavery itself when New York representative James Tallmadge , an opponent of slavery , attempted to amend the statehood bill in the House of Representatives .  Tallmadge proposed that Missouri be admitted as a free state , that no more enslaved people be allowed to enter Missouri after it achieved statehood , and that all enslaved children born there after its admission be freed at age twenty-five .  The amendment shifted the terms of debate by presenting slavery as an evil to be stopped ."
26,"To balance votes in the Senate, ________ was admitted to the Union as a free state at the same time that Missouri was admitted as a slave state."," Congress finally came to an agreement , called the Missouri Compromise , in 1820 .   Missouri and Maine ( which had been part of Massachusetts ) would enter the Union at the same time , Maine as a free state , Missouri as a slave state .  The Tallmadge Amendment was narrowly rejected , the balance between free and slave states was maintained in the Senate , and southerners did not have to fear that Missouri slaveholders would be deprived of their human property . To prevent similar conflicts each time a territory applied for statehood , a line coinciding with the southern border of Missouri ( at latitude 36 ° 30 ' ) was drawn across the remainder of the Louisiana Territory ( Figure 11.8 ) . Slavery could exist south of this line but was forbidden north of it , with the obvious exception of Missouri ."
26,Texas won its independence from Mexico in ________.," The Consultation delegates met again in March 1836 .   They declared their independence from Mexico and drafted a constitution calling for an American-style judicial system and an elected president and legislature .  Significantly , they also established that slavery would not be prohibited in Texas . Many wealthy Tejanos supported the push for independence , hoping for liberal governmental reforms and economic benefits .  Texans ’ hopes for independence were quashed in 1834 , however , when Santa Anna dismissed the Mexican Congress and abolished all state governments , including that of Coahuila y Texas .  In January 1835 , reneging on earlier promises , he dispatched troops to the town of Anahuac to collect customs duties . Lawyer and soldier William B . Travis and a small force marched on Anahuac in June , and the fort surrendered . On October 2 , Anglo-American forces met Mexican troops at the town of Gonzales ; the Mexican troops fled and the Americans moved on to take San Antonio . Now more cautious , delegates to the Consultation of 1835 at San Felipe de Austin voted against declaring independence , instead drafting a statement , which became known as the Declaration of Causes , promising continued loyalty if Mexico returned to a constitutional form of government . They selected Henry Smith , leader of the Independence Party , as governor of Texas and placed Sam Houston , a former soldier who had been a congressman and governor of Tennessee , in charge of its small military force ."
26,Texans defeated the army of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna at the battle of ________.,"Although hungry for revenge , the Texas forces under Sam Houston nevertheless withdrew across Texas , gathering recruits as they went .  Coming upon Santa Anna ’ s encampment on the banks of San Jacinto River on April 21 , 1836 , they waited as the Mexican troops settled for an afternoon nap .   Assured by Houston that “ Victory is certain ! ” and told to “ Trust in God and fear not ! ” the seven hundred men descended on a sleeping force nearly twice their number with cries of “ Remember the Alamo ! ” Within fifteen minutes the Battle of San Jacinto was over .   Approximately half the Mexican troops were killed , and the survivors , including Santa Anna , taken prisoner . "
26,Which of the following was not a reason the United States was reluctant to annex Texas?,"In September 1836 , military hero Sam Houston was elected president of Texas , and , following the relentless logic of U . S . expansion , Texans voted in favor of annexation to the United States . This had been the dream of many settlers in Texas all along . They wanted to expand the United States west and saw Texas as the next logical step . Slaveholders there , such as Sam Houston , William B .

26,"According to treaties signed in 1818 and 1827, with which country did the United States jointly occupy Oregon?"," President Polk — whose campaign slogan in 1844 had been “ Fifty-four forty or fight ! ” — asserted the United States ’ right to gain full control of what was known as Oregon Country , from its southern border at 42 ° latitude ( the current boundary with California ) to its northern border at 54 ° 40 ' latitude .   According to an 1818 agreement , Great Britain and the United States held joint ownership of this territory , but the 1827 Treaty of Joint Occupation opened the land to settlement by both countries .  Realizing that the British were not willing to cede all claims to the territory , Polk proposed the land be divided at 49 ° latitude ( the current border between Washington and Canada ) . The British , however , denied U . S . claims to land north of the Columbia River ( Oregon ’ s current northern border ) ( Figure 11.13 ) . Indeed , the British foreign secretary refused even to relay Polk ’ s proposal to London . However , reports of the difficulty Great Britain would face defending Oregon in the event of a U . S . attack , combined with concerns over affairs at home and elsewhere in its empire , quickly changed the minds of the British , and in June 1846 , Queen Victoria ’ s government agreed to a division at the forty-ninth parallel ."
26,"During the war between the United States and Mexico, revolts against U.S. control broke out in ________."," Despite Kearny ’ s assurances that New Mexicans need not fear for their lives or their property , the region ’ s residents rose in revolt in January 1847 in an effort to drive the Americans away .  Although Price managed to put an end to the rebellion , tensions remained high . Kearny , meanwhile , arrived in California to find it already in American hands through the joint efforts of California settlers , U . S . naval commander John D . Sloat , and John C . Fremont , a former army captain and son-in-law of Missouri senator Thomas Benton . Sloat , at anchor off the coast of Mazatlan , learned that war had begun and quickly set sail for California . He seized the town of Monterey in July 1846 , less than a month after a group of American settlers led by William B . Ide had taken control of Sonoma and declared California a republic . A week after the fall of Monterey , the navy took San Francisco with no resistance . Although some Californios staged a short-lived rebellion in September 1846 , many others submitted to the U . S . takeover . Thus Kearny had little to do other than take command of California as its governor .  General Stephen Watts Kearny , commander of the Army of the West , accepted the surrender of Santa Fe , New Mexico , and moved on to take control of California , leaving Colonel Sterling Price in command .   U . S . military strategy had three main objectives : 1 ) Take control of northern Mexico , including New Mexico ; 2 ) seize California ; and 3 ) capture Mexico City .  General Zachary Taylor and his Army of the Center were assigned to accomplish the first goal , and with superior weapons they soon captured the Mexican city of Monterrey . Taylor quickly became a hero in the eyes of the American people , and Polk appointed him commander of all U . S . forces . In contrast to the diplomatic solution with Great Britain over Oregon , when it came to Mexico , Polk and the American people proved willing to use force to wrest more land for the United States . In keeping with voters ’ expectations , President Polk set his sights on the Mexican state of California . After the mistaken capture of Monterey , negotiations about purchasing the port of San Francisco from Mexico broke off until September 1845 .  Then , following a revolt in California that left it divided in two , Polk attempted to purchase Upper California and New Mexico as well .  These efforts went nowhere . The Mexican government , angered by U . S . actions , refused to recognize the independence of Texas ."
26,The practice of allowing residents of territories to decide whether their land should be slave or free was called ________.,"At the national convention , both sets of delegates were seated — the pro-proviso ones chosen by the Barnburners and the anti-proviso ones chosen by the Hunkers . When it came time to vote for the party ’ s presidential nominee , the majority of votes were for Lewis Cass , an advocate of popular sovereignty .  Popular sovereignty was the belief that citizens should be able to decide issues based on the principle of majority rule ; in this case , residents of a territory should have the right to decide whether slavery would be allowed in it .  Theoretically , this doctrine would allow slavery to become established in any U . S . territory , including those from which it had been banned by earlier laws ."
26,Which of the following was not a provision of the Compromise of 1850?,"5 .  The border between Texas and New Mexico was established .  4 .  Under a new fugitive slave law , those who helped escaped enslaved individuals or refused to assist in their return would be fined and possibly imprisoned .  3 .  The slave trade was banned in the nation ’ s capital .   Slavery , however , was allowed to remain .  2 .  Popular sovereignty was to determine the status of slavery in New Mexico and Utah , even though Utah and part of New Mexico were north of the Missouri Compromise line .  1 .  California , which was ready to enter the Union , was admitted as a free state in accordance with its state constitution .   Beginning in January 1850 , Congress worked for eight months on a compromise that might quiet the growing sectional conflict .   Led by the aged Henry Clay , members finally agreed to the following : "
27,Which of the following is a barrier against pathogens provided by the skin?," Before any immune factors are triggered , the skin functions as a continuous , impassable barrier to potentially infectious pathogens .   Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation ( drying out ) and by the skin ’ s acidity .  In addition , beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens , preventing infection . Regions of the body that are not protected by skin ( such as the eyes and mucus membranes ) have alternative methods of defense , such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens , and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of the body . Throughout the body are other defenses , such as the low pH of the stomach ( which inhibits the growth of pathogens ) , blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes , and the process of urination ( which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract ) ."
27,"Although interferons have several effects, they are particularly useful against infections with which type of pathogen?","In response to interferons , uninfected cells alter their gene expression , which increases the cells ’ resistance to infection .  One effect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis .   Virally infected cells produce more viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins .   Thus , by reducing protein synthesis , a cell becomes resistant to viral infection . "
27,Which organelle do phagocytes use to digest engulfed particles?,"The first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory ; that is , they encourage inflammation , the localized redness , swelling , heat , and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection . The population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen . Both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis . A neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens . Neutrophils , shown in Figure 42.3 , are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system .  Neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes , and they contain organelles , called lysosomes , that digest engulfed pathogens .  An eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite ; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes ( parasitic worms ) ."
27,Which innate immune system component uses MHC I molecules directly in its defense strategy?,"CTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs . Binding of TCRs with antigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme , degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected cell . Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells . In this process , the CTL does not become infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes .  In fact , the functions of NK cells and CTLs are complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells , as illustrated in Figure 42.14 .   If the NK cell cannot identify the “ missing self ” pattern of down-regulated MHC I molecules , then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I with foreign antigens , which signals “ altered self . ” Similarly , if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because the receptors are depleted from the cell surface , NK cells will destroy the cell instead .  CTLs also emit cytokines , such as interferons , that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells , such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed . Moreover , these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles .  NK cells are always active ; an interaction with normal , intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence , and the NK cell moves on .  After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell , its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of perforin , a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell . Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse . A granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death , or apoptosis . Phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind . NK cells are constantly patrolling the body and are an effective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression . Lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large , darkly staining nuclei ; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm , as shown in Figure 42.6 .  Infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer ( NK ) cells , lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells ( abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue ) .  T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes . T cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland , and B cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow .  NK cells identify intracellular infections , especially from viruses , by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) I molecules on the surface of infected cells .  MHC I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells , thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated . The function of MHC I molecules is to display fragments of proteins from the infectious agents within the cell to T-cells ; healthy cells will be ignored , while “ non-self ” or foreign proteins will be attacked by the immune system . MHC II molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens ( “ non-self proteins ” ) and on lymphocytes . MHC II molecules interact with helper T-cells to trigger the appropriate immune response , which may include the inflammatory response . An infected cell ( or a tumor cell ) is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying MHC I molecules appropriately . The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and / or trafficking to the cell surface . The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active inhibitors being produced by the viruses . This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface , which NK cells detect as “ unhealthy ” or “ abnormal ” while searching for cellular MHC I molecules . Similarly , the dramatically altered gene expression of tumor cells leads to expression of extremely deformed or absent MHC I molecules that also signal “ unhealthy ” or “ abnormal . ”"
27,Which of the following is both a phagocyte and an antigen-presenting cell?," Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells , such as macrophages or neutrophils , because phagocytic cells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies .  Phagocytic enhancement by antibodies is called opsonization . In a process called complement fixation , IgM and IgG in serum bind to antigens and provide docking sites onto which sequential complement proteins can bind . The combination of antibodies and complement enhances opsonization even further and promotes rapid clearing of pathogens . The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens , and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens .  An antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) is an immune cell that detects , engulfs , and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection .  When a pathogen is detected , these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen . Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC , where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells . Dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material ; they are present in the skin ( Langerhans cells ) and the lining of the nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines . Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response , thus functioning as an antigen-presenting cell .  Macrophages also function as APCs .  Before activation and differentiation , B cells can also function as APCs . An infection may be intracellular or extracellular , depending on the pathogen . All viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells ( intracellularly ) , whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly , depending on the species . The innate immune system must respond accordingly : by identifying the extracellular pathogen and / or by identifying host cells that have already been infected . When a pathogen enters the body , cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) on the pathogen ’ s surface . PAMPs are carbohydrate , polypeptide , and nucleic acid “ signatures ” that are expressed by viruses , bacteria , and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells . The immune system has specific cells , described in Figure 42.2 and shown in Figure 42.3 , with receptors that recognize these PAMPs .  A macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens .  Macrophages recognize PAMPs via complementary pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) . PRRs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment . A monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue . Dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction . Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are a type of PRR that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules ) . TLRs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates , and appear to be one of the most ancient components of the immune system . TLRs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system . Cytokine Release Effect The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines , which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells . A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation ( form and function ) , proliferation ( production ) , and gene expression to affect immune responses . At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them , the cell type that responds to them , and the changes they produce . One type cytokine , interferon , is illustrated in Figure 42.4 . One subclass of cytokines is the interleukin ( IL ) , so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes ( white blood cells ) . Interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses . In addition to being released from cells after PAMP recognition , cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines , which results in a cytokine burst ."
27,Which immune cells bind MHC molecules on APCs via CD8 coreceptors on their cell surfaces?,"Naïve T cells can express one of two different molecules , CD4 or CD8 , on their surface , as shown in Figure 42.11 , and are accordingly classified as CD4 + or CD8 + cells . These molecules are important because they regulate how a T cell will interact with and respond to an APC . Naïve CD4 + cells bind APCs via their antigen-embedded MHC II molecules and are stimulated to become helper T ( T H ) lymphocytes , cells that go on to stimulate B cells ( or cytotoxic T cells ) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat .  In contrast , CD8 + cells engage antigen-embedded MHC I molecules on APCs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response .  The two populations of T cells have different mechanisms of immune protection , but both bind MHC molecules via their antigen receptors called T cell receptors ( TCRs ) . The CD4 or CD8 surface molecules differentiate whether the TCR will engage an MHC II or an MHC I molecule . Because they assist in binding specificity , the CD4 and CD8 molecules are described as coreceptors ."
27,What “self” pattern is identified by NK cells?,"CTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs . Binding of TCRs with antigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme , degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected cell . Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells . In this process , the CTL does not become infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes . In fact , the functions of NK cells and CTLs are complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells , as illustrated in Figure 42.14 .  If the NK cell cannot identify the “ missing self ” pattern of down-regulated MHC I molecules , then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I with foreign antigens , which signals “ altered self . ” Similarly , if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because the receptors are depleted from the cell surface , NK cells will destroy the cell instead .  CTLs also emit cytokines , such as interferons , that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells , such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed . Moreover , these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles ."
27,"The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or destructive immune reaction to a harmless foreign particle, such as a food protein, is called ________."," The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful , unnecessary responses to harmless substances , and more importantly so that it does not attack “ self . ” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance .  Immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances ( such as food proteins ) that APCs of the oral cavity , pharynx , and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter . Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver , lymph nodes , small intestine , and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory T ( T reg ) cells , specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors . The combined result of T reg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead . In addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens , other subsets of T reg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response , which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self-antigens . Another T reg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis ."
27,A memory B cell can differentiate upon re-exposure to a pathogen of which cell type?,"If the pathogen is never encountered again during the individual ’ s lifetime , B and T memory cells will circulate for a few years or even several decades and will gradually die off , having never functioned as effector cells .  However , if the host is re-exposed to the same pathogen type , circulating memory cells will immediately differentiate into plasma cells and CTLs without input from APCs or T H cells .  One reason the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for naïve B and T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities to be identified and activated . Upon reinfection , this step is skipped , and the result is a more rapid production of immune defenses .  Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundreds-fold greater antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response , as the graph in Figure 42.17 illustrates .  This rapid and dramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established , and the individual may not realize they had been exposed ."
27,Foreign particles circulating in the blood are filtered by the ________.,"Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them , as illustrated in Figure 42.24 , by blocking key sites on the pathogen that enhance their infectivity ( such as receptors that “ dock ” pathogens on host cells ) . Antibody neutralization can prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells , as opposed to the CTL-mediated approach of killing cells that are already infected to prevent progression of an established infection .  The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces .  On maturation , T and B lymphocytes circulate to various destinations . Lymph nodes scattered throughout the body , as illustrated in Figure 42.20 , house large populations of T and B cells , dendritic cells , and macrophages . Lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues . These antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation . APCs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens . The spleen houses B and T cells , macrophages , dendritic cells , and NK cells .  The spleen , shown in Figure 42.21 , is the site where APCs that have trapped foreign particles in the blood can communicate with lymphocytes .   Antibodies are synthesized and secreted by activated plasma cells in the spleen , and the spleen filters foreign substances and antibody-complexed pathogens from the blood .  Functionally , the spleen is to the blood as lymph nodes are to the lymph . 42.3 Antibodies Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
27,The structure of an antibody is similar to the extracellular component of which receptor?,"Similar to TCRs and BCRs , antibody diversity is produced by the mutation and recombination of approximately 300 different gene segments encoding the light and heavy chain variable domains in precursor cells that are destined to become B cells . The variable domains from the heavy and light chains interact to form the binding site through which an antibody can bind a specific epitope on an antigen . The numbers of repeated constant domains in Ig classes are the same for all antibodies corresponding to a specific class .  Antibodies are structurally similar to the extracellular component of the BCRs , and B cell maturation to plasma cells can be visualized in simple terms as the cell acquires the ability to secrete the extracellular portion of its BCR in large quantities . "
27,The first antibody class to appear in the serum in response to a newly encountered pathogen is ________.," After an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen , typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood .  BCRs on naïve B cells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class . IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all antibodies . Prior to antibody secretion , plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers ( five individual antibodies ) linked by a joining ( J ) chain , as shown in Figure 42.23 . The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens . However , IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as IgGs , which are one of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon re-exposure to the same pathogen . Figure 42.23 summarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures .  Antibodies can be divided into five classes — IgM , IgG , IgA , IgD , IgE — based on their physiochemical , structural , and immunological properties .  IgGs , which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies , have heavy chains that consist of one variable domain and three identical constant domains . IgA and IgD also have three constant domains per heavy chain , whereas IgM and IgE each have four constant domains per heavy chain . The variable domain determines binding specificity and the constant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological mechanism of action of the corresponding antibody class . It is possible for two antibodies to have the same binding specificities but be in different classes and , therefore , to be involved in different functions ."

27,Breastfed infants typically are resistant to disease because of ________.,"Differentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response , and the antibodies they secrete are particularly significant against extracellular pathogens and toxins . Antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells . Antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease .  For instance , a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donor ’ s blood serum .   This phenomenon is called passive immunity ; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding , which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life . "
27,Allergy to pollen is classified as:," The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy .  In the United States , 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma , whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens . Upon initial exposure to a potential allergen , an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to T H cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE . This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms . The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues . This process primes , or sensitizes , the tissue . Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen , IgE molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin ; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses .  Figure 42.26 shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen .  The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy , watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives , airway contraction with severe respiratory distress , and plummeting blood pressure . This extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock . If not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects , this condition can be fatal . Neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens , such as bacteria and fungi . A mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules , such as histamine , in response to large pathogens . A basophil is a leukocyte that , like a neutrophil , releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in Figure 42.5 . Basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses . Eosinophils and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes .  A hypersensitive immune response to harmless antigens , such as in pollen , often involves the release of histamine by basophils and mast cells .  Cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick , which include lethargy , muscle pain , and nausea . These effects may have evolved because the symptoms encourage the individual to rest and prevent them from spreading the infection to others . Cytokines also increase the core body temperature , causing a fever , which causes the liver to withhold iron from the blood . Without iron , certain pathogens , such as some bacteria , are unable to replicate ; this is called nutritional immunity ."
27,A potential cause of acquired autoimmunity is ________.," Autoimmunity can develop with time , and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry .  Antibodies and TCRs may bind self antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens , which the immune receptors first raised . As an example , infection with Streptococcus pyogenes ( bacterium that causes strep throat ) may generate antibodies or T cells that react with heart muscle , which has a similar structure to the surface of S . pyogenes . These antibodies can damage heart muscle with autoimmune attacks , leading to rheumatic fever . Insulin-dependent ( Type 1 ) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive inflammatory T H 1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas . Patients with this autoimmunity must be injected with insulin that originates from other sources ."
27,Autoantibodies are probably involved in:,"Autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population . Most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response . Antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies . In patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis , muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies . The result is muscle weakness that may include marked difficultly with fine and / or gross motor functions .  In systemic lupus erythematosus , a diffuse autoantibody response to the individual ’ s own DNA and proteins results in various systemic diseases .  As illustrated in Figure 42.27 , systemic lupus erythematosus may affect the heart , joints , lungs , skin , kidneys , central nervous system , or other tissues , causing tissue damage via antibody binding , complement recruitment , lysis , and inflammation ."
27,Which of the following diseases is not due to autoimmunity?,"Autoimmunity can develop with time , and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry . Antibodies and TCRs may bind self antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens , which the immune receptors first raised .

28,Which genus includes the causative agent for malaria?,"Chapter Outline 5.1 Unicellular Eukaryotic Parasites 5.2 Parasitic Helminths 5.3 Fungi 5.4 Algae 5.5 Lichens Introduction Although bacteria and viruses account for a large number of the infectious diseases that afflict humans , many serious illnesses are caused by eukaryotic organisms .  One example is malaria , which is caused by Plasmodium , a eukaryotic organism transmitted through mosquito bites .  Malaria is a major cause of morbidity ( illness ) and mortality ( death ) that threatens 3.4 billion people worldwide . 1 In severe cases , organ failure and blood or metabolic abnormalities contribute to medical emergencies and sometimes death . Even after initial recovery , relapses may occur years later . In countries where malaria is endemic , the disease represents a major public health challenge that can place a tremendous strain on developing economies . 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . “ Impact of Malaria . ” September 22 , 2015 . http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/impact.html . Accessed January 18 , 2016 . Worldwide , major efforts are underway to reduce malaria infections . Efforts include the distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and the spraying of pesticides . Researchers are also making progress in their efforts to develop effective vaccines . 2 The President ’ s Malaria Initiative , started in 2005 , supports prevention and treatment . The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has a large initiative to eliminate malaria . Despite these efforts , malaria continues to cause long-term morbidity ( such as intellectual disabilities in children ) and mortality ( especially in children younger than 5 years ) , so we still have far to go . 2 RTS , S Clinical Trials Partnership . “ Efficacy and safety of RTS , S / AS01 malaria vaccine with or without a booster dose in infants and children in Africa : final results of a phase 3 , individually randomised , controlled trial . ” The Lancet 23 April 2015 .

28,Which protist is a concern because of its ability to contaminate water supplies and cause diarrheal illness?,"The third and final supergroup to be considered in this section is the Excavata , which includes primitive eukaryotes and many parasites with limited metabolic abilities . These organisms have complex cell shapes and structures , often including a depression on the surface of the cell called an excavate . The group Excavata includes the subgroups Fornicata , Parabasalia , and Euglenozoa . The Fornicata lack mitochondria but have flagella .  This group includes Giardia lamblia ( also known as G . intestinalis or G . duodenalis ) , a widespread pathogen that causes diarrheal illness and can be spread through cysts from feces that contaminate water supplies ( Figure 5.3 ) .  Parabasalia are frequent animal endosymbionts ; they live in the guts of animals like termites and cockroaches . They have basal bodies and modified mitochondria ( kinetoplastids ) . They also have a large , complex cell structure with an undulating membrane and often have many flagella . The trichomonads ( a subgroup of the Parabasalia ) include pathogens such as Trichomonas vaginalis , which causes the human sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis . Trichomoniasis often does not cause symptoms in men , but men are able to transmit the infection . In women , it causes vaginal discomfort and discharge and may cause complications in pregnancy if left untreated . Eukaryotic microbes are an extraordinarily diverse group , including species with a wide range of life cycles , morphological specializations , and nutritional needs . Although more diseases are caused by viruses and bacteria than by microscopic eukaryotes , these eukaryotes are responsible for some diseases of great public health importance . For example , the protozoal disease malaria was responsible for 584,000 deaths worldwide ( primarily children in Africa ) in 2013 , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .  The protist parasite Giardia causes a diarrheal illness ( giardiasis ) that is easily transmitted through contaminated water supplies .  In the United States , Giardia is the most common human intestinal parasite ( Figure 5.3 ) . Although it may seem surprising , parasitic worms are included within the study of microbiology because identification depends on observation of microscopic adult worms or eggs . Even in developed countries , these worms are important parasites of humans and of domestic animals . There are fewer fungal pathogens , but these are important causes of illness , as well . On the other hand , fungi have been important in producing antimicrobial substances such as penicillin . In this chapter , we will examine characteristics of protists , worms , and fungi while considering their roles in causing disease ."
28,A fluke is classified within which of the following?," Phylum Platyhelminthes ( the platyhelminths ) are flatworms .   This group includes the flukes , tapeworms , and the turbellarians , which include planarians .  The flukes and tapeworms are medically important parasites ( Figure 5.20 ) ."
28,"A nonsegmented worm is found during a routine colonoscopy of an individual who reported having abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. This worm is likely which of the following?"," Phylum Nematoda ( the roundworms ) is a diverse group containing more than 15,000 species , of which several are important human parasites ( Figure 5.19 ) .   These unsegmented worms have a full digestive system even when parasitic .  Some are common intestinal parasites , and their eggs can sometimes be identified in feces or around the anus of infected individuals .  Ascaris lumbricoides is the largest nematode intestinal parasite found in humans ; females may reach lengths greater than 1 meter .  A . lumbricoides is also very widespread , even in developed nations , although it is now a relatively uncommon problem in the United States . It may cause symptoms ranging from relatively mild ( such as a cough and mild abdominal pain ) to severe ( such as intestinal blockage and impaired growth ) ."
28,A segmented worm has male and female reproductive organs in each segment. Some use hooks to attach to the intestinal wall. Which type of worm is this?," The other medically important group of platyhelminths are commonly known as tapeworms ( cestodes ) and are segmented flatworms that may have suckers or hooks at the scolex ( head region ) ( Figure 5.21 ) .  Tapeworms use these suckers or hooks to attach to the wall of the small intestine . The body of the worm is made up of segments called proglottid s that contain reproductive structures ; these detach when the gametes are fertilized , releasing gravid proglottids with eggs . Tapeworms often have an intermediate host that consumes the eggs , which then hatch into a larval form called an oncosphere . The oncosphere migrates to a particular tissue or organ in the intermediate host , where it forms cysticerci . After being eaten by the definitive host , the cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms in the host's digestive system ( Figure 5.23 ) . Taenia saginata ( the beef tapeworm ) and T . solium ( the pork tapeworm ) enter humans through ingestion of undercooked , contaminated meat . The adult worms develop and reside in the intestine , but the larval stage may migrate and be found in other body locations such as skeletal and smooth muscle . The beef tapeworm is relatively benign , although it can cause digestive problems and , occasionally , allergic reactions . The pork tapeworm can cause more serious problems when the larvae leave the intestine and colonize other tissues , including those of the central nervous system . Diphylobothrium latum is the largest human tapeworm and can be ingested in undercooked fish . It can grow to a length of 15 meters . Echinococcus granulosus , the dog tapeworm , can parasitize humans and uses dogs as an important host ."
28,Mushrooms are a type of which of the following?," The Basidiomycota ( basidiomycetes ) are fungi that have basidia ( club-shaped structures ) that produce basidiospores ( spores produced through budding ) within fruiting bodies called basidiocarps ( Figure 5.32 ) .  They are important as decomposers and as food .  This group includes rusts , stinkhorns , puffballs , and mushrooms .  Several species are of particular importance . Cryptococcus neoformans , a fungus commonly found as a yeast in the environment , can cause serious lung infections when inhaled by individuals with weakened immune systems . The edible meadow mushroom , Agricus campestris , is a basidiomycete , as is the poisonous mushroom Amanita phalloides , known as the death cap . The deadly toxins produced by A . phalloides have been used to study transcription ."
28,Which of the following is the most common cause of human yeast infections?,"Many species of ascomycetes are medically important . A large number of species in the genera Trichophyton , Microsporum , and Epidermophyton are dermatophytes , pathogenic fungi capable of causing skin infections such as athlete ’ s foot , jock itch , and ringworm . Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus that can cause blastomycosis , a respiratory infection that , if left untreated , can become disseminated to other body sites , sometimes leading to death . Another important respiratory pathogen is the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum ( Figure 5.26 ) , which is associated with birds and bats in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys . Coccidioides immitis causes the serious lung disease Valley fever .  Candida albicans , the most common cause of vaginal and other yeast infections , is also an ascomycete fungus ; it is a part of the normal microbiota of the skin , intestine , genital tract , and ear ( Figure 5.29 ) .  Ascomycetes also cause plant diseases , including ergot infections , Dutch elm disease , and powdery mildews . In contrast to molds , yeasts are unicellular fungi . The budding yeasts reproduce asexually by budding off a smaller daughter cell ; the resulting cells may sometimes stick together as a short chain or pseudohypha ( Figure 5.25 ) . Some fungi are dimorphic , having more than one appearance during their life cycle . These dimorphic fungi may be able to appear as yeasts or molds , which can be important for infectivity . They are capable of changing their appearance in response to environmental changes such as nutrient availability or fluctuations in temperature , growing as a mold , for example , at 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) , and as yeast cells at 37 ° C ( 98.6 ° F ) . This ability helps dimorphic fungi to survive in diverse environments .  Two examples of dimorphic yeasts are the human pathogens Histoplasma capsulatum and Candida albicans .   H . capsulatum causes the lung disease histoplasmosis , and C . albicans is associated with vaginal yeast infections , oral thrush , and candidiasis of the skin ( Figure 5.26 ) . "
28,Which of the following is an ascomycete fungus associated with bat droppings that can cause a respiratory infection if inhaled?,"Many species of ascomycetes are medically important . A large number of species in the genera Trichophyton , Microsporum , and Epidermophyton are dermatophytes , pathogenic fungi capable of causing skin infections such as athlete ’ s foot , jock itch , and ringworm .

Candida albicans , the most common cause of vaginal and other yeast infections , is also an ascomycete fungus ; it is a part of the normal microbiota of the skin , intestine , genital tract , and ear ( Figure 5.29 ) . Ascomycetes also cause plant diseases , including ergot infections , Dutch elm disease , and powdery mildews ."
28,Which polysaccharide found in red algal cell walls is a useful solidifying agent?,"Chlorella is a nonmotile , large , unicellular alga , and Acetabularia is an even larger unicellular green alga . The size of these organisms challenges the idea that all cells are small , and they have been used in genetics research since Joachim Hämmerling ( 1901 – 1980 ) began to work with them in 1943 . Volvox is a colonial , unicellular alga ( Figure 5.37 ) . A larger , multicellular green alga is Ulva , also known as the sea lettuce because of its large , edible , green blades . The range of life forms within the Chlorophyta — from unicellular to various levels of coloniality to multicellular forms — has been a useful research model for understanding the evolution of multicellularity . The red algae are mainly multicellular but include some unicellular forms .  They have rigid cell walls containing agar or carrageenan , which are useful as food solidifying agents and as a solidifier added to growth media for microbes .  The algae are autotrophic protists that can be unicellular or multicellular .  These organisms are found in the supergroups Chromalveolata ( dinoflagellates , diatoms , golden algae , and brown algae ) and Archaeplastida ( red algae and green algae ) .  They are important ecologically and environmentally because they are responsible for the production of approximately 70 % of the oxygen and organic matter in aquatic environments . Some types of algae , even those that are microscopic , are regularly eaten by humans and other animals .  Additionally , algae are the source for agar , agarose , and carrageenan , solidifying agents used in laboratories and in food production .  Although algae are typically not pathogenic , some produce toxins . Harmful algal bloom s , which occur when algae grow quickly and produce dense populations , can produce high concentrations of toxins that impair liver and nervous-system function in aquatic animals and humans ."
28,Which is the term for the hard outer covering of some dinoflagellates?,"The dinoflagellates and stramenopiles fall within the Chromalveolata . The dinoflagellates are mostly marine organisms and are an important component of plankton . They have a variety of nutritional types and may be phototrophic , heterotrophic , or mixotrophic . Those that are photosynthetic use chlorophyll a , chlorophyll c 2 , and other photosynthetic pigments ( Figure 5.35 ) . They generally have two flagella , causing them to whirl ( in fact , the name dinoflagellate comes from the Greek word for “ whirl ” : dini ) .  Some have cellulose plates forming a hard outer covering , or theca , as armor .  Additionally , some dinoflagellates produce neurotoxins that can cause paralysis in humans or fish . Exposure can occur through contact with water containing the dinoflagellate toxins or by feeding on organisms that have eaten dinoflagellates ."
28,Which protists are associated with red tides?," When a population of dinoflagellates becomes particularly dense , a red tide ( a type of harmful algal bloom ) can occur .  Red tides cause harm to marine life and to humans who consume contaminated marine life . Major toxin producers include Gonyaulax and Alexandrium , both of which cause paralytic shellfish poisoning . Another species , Pfiesteria piscicida , is known as a fish killer because , at certain parts of its life cycle , it can produce toxins harmful to fish and it appears to be responsible for a suite of symptoms , including memory loss and confusion , in humans exposed to water containing the species ."
28,You encounter a lichen with leafy structures. Which term describes this lichen?," Lichens are classified as fungi and the fungal partners belong to the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota .  Lichens can also be grouped into types based on their morphology . There are three major types of lichens , although other types exist as well . Lichens that are tightly attached to the substrate , giving them a crusty appearance , are called crustose lichens .  Those that have leaf-like lobes are foliose lichens ; they may only be attached at one point in the growth form , and they also have a second cortex below the medulla .  Finally , fruticose lichens have rounded structures and an overall branched appearance . Figure 5.39 shows an example of each of the forms of lichens ."
28,Which of the following is the term for the outer layer of a lichen?," Lichens have a body called a thallus , an outer , tightly packed fungal layer called a cortex , and an inner , loosely packed fungal layer called a medulla ( Figure 5.38 ) .  Lichens use hyphal bundles called rhizines to attach to the substrate ."
28,The fungus in a lichen is which of the following?," A lichen is a combination of two organisms , a green alga or cyanobacterium and fungus , living in a symbiotic relationship .  Whereas algae normally grow only in aquatic or extremely moist environments , lichens can potentially be found on almost any surface ( especially rocks ) or as epiphytes ( meaning that they grow on other plants ) . In some ways , the symbiotic relationship between lichens and algae seems like a mutualism ( a relationship in which both organisms benefit ) . The fungus can obtain photosynthates from the algae or cyanobacterium and the algae or cyanobacterium can grow in a drier environment than it could otherwise tolerate . However , most scientists consider this symbiotic relationship to be a controlled parasitism ( a relationship in which one organism benefits and the other is harmed ) because the photosynthetic organism grows less well than it would without the fungus . It is important to note that such symbiotic interactions fall along a continuum between conflict and cooperation . Many species of ascomycetes are medically important . A large number of species in the genera Trichophyton , Microsporum , and Epidermophyton are dermatophytes , pathogenic fungi capable of causing skin infections such as athlete ’ s foot , jock itch , and ringworm . Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus that can cause blastomycosis , a respiratory infection that , if left untreated , can become disseminated to other body sites , sometimes leading to death . Another important respiratory pathogen is the dimorphic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum ( Figure 5.26 ) , which is associated with birds and bats in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys . Coccidioides immitis causes the serious lung disease Valley fever .  Candida albicans , the most common cause of vaginal and other yeast infections , is also an ascomycete fungus ; it is a part of the normal microbiota of the skin , intestine , genital tract , and ear ( Figure 5.29 ) .  Ascomycetes also cause plant diseases , including ergot infections , Dutch elm disease , and powdery mildews ."
29,The Great Compromise successfully resolved differences between ________.," The storm of debate over how to allocate power between large and small states was eventually calmed by a third proposal .   The Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house .  The upper house , the Senate , was to have two members from each state . This soothed the fears of the small states . In the lower house , the House of Representatives , membership would be proportional to the population in each state . This measure protected the interests of the large states ."
29,"While each state has two senators, members of the House are apportioned ________.","The U . S . Constitution is very clear about who can be elected as a member of the House or Senate . A House member must be a U . S . citizen of at least seven years ’ standing and at least twenty-five years old . Senators are required to have nine years ’ standing as citizens and be at least thirty years old when sworn in . Representatives serve two-year terms , whereas senators serve six-year terms . Per the Supreme Court decision in U . S . Term Limits v . Thornton ( 1995 ) , there are currently no term limits for either senators or representatives , despite efforts by many states to impose them in the mid - 1990s . 9 House members are elected by the voters in their specific congressional districts .  There are currently 435 congressional districts in the United States and thus 435 House members , and each state has a number of House districts roughly proportional to its share of the total U . S . population , with states guaranteed at least one House member .   Two senators are elected by each state .   The Constitution specifies that every state will have two senators who each serve a six-year term .  Therefore , with fifty states in the Union , there are currently one hundred seats in the U . S . Senate . Senators were originally appointed by state legislatures , but in 1913 , the Seventeenth Amendment was approved , which allowed for senators to be elected by popular vote in each state .  Seats in the House of Representatives are distributed among the states based on each state ’ s population and each member of the House is elected by voters in a specific congressional district .  Each state is guaranteed at least one seat in the House ( Table 11.1 ) .  The storm of debate over how to allocate power between large and small states was eventually calmed by a third proposal .   The Connecticut Compromise , also called the Great Compromise , proposed a bicameral congress with members apportioned differently in each house .   The upper house , the Senate , was to have two members from each state .  This soothed the fears of the small states . In the lower house , the House of Representatives , membership would be proportional to the population in each state . This measure protected the interests of the large states ."
29,The process of redistricting can present problems for congressional representation because ________.," These aren ’ t geographical features or large infrastructure projects .   Rather , they are racially gerrymandered congressional districts .   Their strange shapes are the product of careful district restructuring organized around the goal of enhancing the votes of minority groups .  The alligator-mouth District 4 in Illinois , for example , was drawn to bring a number of geographically autonomous Latino groups in Illinois together in the same congressional district ."
29,Which of the following is an implied power of Congress?," Finding a Middle Ground Understanding the Limits of Congress ’ s Power to Regulate One of the most important constitutional anchors for Congress ’ s implicit power to regulate all manner of activities within the states is the short clause in Article I , Section 8 , which says Congress is empowered to “ to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the several States , and with Indian Tribes . ” The Supreme Court ’ s broad interpretation of this so-called commerce clause has greatly expanded the power and reach of Congress over the centuries . "
29,Senate races tend to inspire ________.," Because the Senate is much smaller than the House , senators hold more committee assignments than House members .  There are sixteen standing committees in the Senate , and each position must be filled . In contrast , in the House , with 435 members and only twenty standing committees , committee members have time to pursue a more in-depth review of a policy .  House members historically defer to the decisions of committees , while senators tend to view committee decisions as recommendations , often seeking additional discussion that could lead to changes . "
29,The saying “All politics is local” roughly means ________.," The importance of airing positive constituent casework during campaigns is a testament to the accuracy of saying , “ All politics is local . ” This phrase , attributed to former Speaker of the House Tip O ’ Neill ( D-MA ) , essentially means that the most important motivations directing voters are rooted in local concerns .  In general , this is true . People naturally feel more driven by the things that affect them on a daily basis . These are concerns like the quality of the roads , the availability of good jobs , and the cost and quality of public education . Good senators and representatives understand this and will seek to use their influence and power in office to affect these issues for the better . This is an age-old strategy for success in office and elections ."
29,A congressperson who pursued a strict delegate model of representation would seek to ________.,"Understandably , few if any representatives adhere strictly to one model or the other . Instead , most find themselves attempting to balance the important principles embedded in each .  Political scientists call this the politico model of representation .   In it , members of Congress act as either trustee or delegate based on rational political calculations about who is best served , the constituency or the nation .  Traditionally , representatives have seen their role as that of a delegate , a trustee , or someone attempting to balance the two .  A representative who sees him - or herself as a delegate believes he or she is empowered merely to enact the wishes of constituents .   Delegates must employ some means to identify the views of their constituents and then vote accordingly .   They are not permitted the liberty of employing their own reason and judgment while acting as representatives in Congress .  This is the delegate model of representation . The tension between local and national politics described in the previous section is essentially a struggle between interpretations of representation .  Representation is a complex concept .   It can mean paying careful attention to the concerns of constituents , understanding that representatives must act as they see fit based on what they feel best for the constituency , or relying on the particular ethnic , racial , or gender diversity of those in office .  In this section , we will explore three different models of representation and the concept of descriptive representation .  We will look at the way members of Congress navigate the challenging terrain of representation as they serve , and all the many predictable and unpredictable consequences of the decisions they make . "
29,The increasing value constituents have placed on descriptive representation in Congress has had the effect of ________.," While the strategy of creating majority-minority districts has been a success for minorities ’ representation in Congress , its long-term effect has revealed a disturbing paradox : Congress as a whole has become less enthusiastic about minority-specific issues .  How is this possible ? The problem is that by creating districts with high percentages of minority constituents , strategists have made the other districts less diverse . The representatives in those districts are under very little pressure to consider the interests of minority groups . As a result , they typically do not . 2"
29,House leaders are more powerful than Senate leaders because of ________.,"Like the House , the Senate also has majority and minority leaders and whips , each with duties very similar to those of their counterparts in the House . Unlike the House , however , the Senate doesn ’ t have a Speaker . The duties and powers held by the Speaker in the House fall to the majority leader in the Senate . Another difference is that , according to the U . S . Constitution , the Senate ’ s president is actually the elected vice president of the United States , but he or she may vote only in case of a tie . Apart from this and very few other exceptions , the president of the Senate does not actually operate in the Senate .  Instead , the Constitution allows for the Senate to choose a president pro tempore — usually the most senior senator of the majority party — who presides over the Senate .  Despite the title , the job is largely a formal and powerless role . The real power in the Senate is in the hands of the majority leader ( Figure 11.16 ) and the minority leader . Like the Speaker of the House , the majority leader is the chief spokesperson for the majority party , but unlike in the House he or she does not run the floor alone . Because of the traditions of unlimited debate and the filibuster , the majority and minority leaders often occupy the floor together in an attempt to keep things moving along . At times , their interactions are intense and partisan , but for the Senate to get things done , they must cooperate to get the sixty votes needed to run this super-majority legislative institution .  Despite the power of the conferences , however , the most important leadership position in the House is actually elected by the entire body of representatives .   This position is called the Speaker of the House and is the only House officer mentioned in the Constitution .  The Constitution does not require the Speaker to be a member of the House , although to date , all fifty-four Speakers have been . The Speaker is the presiding officer , the administrative head of the House , the partisan leader of the majority party in the House , and an elected representative of a single congressional district ( Figure 11.16 ) . As a testament to the importance of the Speaker , since 1947 , the holder of this position has been second in line to succeed the president in an emergency , after the vice president ."
29,A select committee is different from a standing committee because ________.,"Four types of committees exist in the House and the Senate .  The first is the standing , or permanent , committee .  This committee is the first call for proposed bills , fewer than 10 percent of which are reported out of committee to the floor . The second type is the joint committee . Joint committee members are appointed from both the House and the Senate , and are charged with exploring a few key issues , such as the economy and taxation . However , joint committees have no bill-referral authority whatsoever — they are informational only . A conference committee is used to reconcile different bills passed in both the House and the Senate . The conference committees are appointed on an ad hoc basis as necessary when a bill passes the House and Senate in different forms .  Finally , ad hoc , special , or select committees are temporary committees set up to address specific topics .  These types of committees often conduct special investigations , such as on aging or ethics ."
29,Stopping a filibuster requires that ________.," This flexibility about speaking in the Senate gave rise to a unique tactic , the filibuster .  The word “ filibuster ” comes from the Dutch word vrijbuiter , which means pirate . And the name is appropriate , since a senator who launches a filibuster virtually hijacks the floor of the chamber by speaking for long periods of time , thus preventing the Senate from closing debate and acting on a bill . The tactic was perfected in the 1850s as Congress wrestled with the complicated issue of slavery . After the Civil War , the use of the filibuster became even more common . Eventually , in 1917 , the Senate passed Rule 22 , which allowed the chamber to hold a cloture vote to end debate . To invoke cloture , the Senate had to get a two-thirds majority . This was difficult to do , but it generally did prevent anyone from hijacking the Senate floor , with the salient exception of Senator Strom Thurmond ’ s record twenty-four-hour filibuster of the Civil Rights Act .  In 1975 , after the heightened partisanship of the civil rights era , the Senate further weakened the filibuster by reducing the number needed for cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths , or sixty votes , where it remains today ( except for judicial nominations for which only fifty-five votes are needed to invoke cloture ) .  Moreover , filibusters are not permitted on the annual budget reconciliation act ( the Reconciliation Act of 2010 was the act under which the implementing legislation for Obamacare was passed ) ."
29,Saying a bill is being marked up is just another way to say it is being ________.," Once hearings have been completed , the bill enters the markup stage .   This is essentially an amending and voting process .  In the end , with or without amendments , the committee or subcommittee will vote . If the committee decides not to advance the bill at that time , it is tabled . Tabling a bill typically means the bill is dead , but there is still an option to bring it back up for a vote again . If the committee decides to advance the bill , however , it is printed and goes to the chamber , either the House or the Senate . For the sake of example , we will assume that a bill goes first to the House ( although the reverse could be true , and , in fact , bills can move simultaneously through both chambers ) . Before it reaches the House floor , it must first go through the House Committee on Rules . This committee establishes the rules of debate , such as time limits and limits on the number and type of amendments . After these rules have been established , the bill moves through the floor , where it is debated and amendments can be added . Once the limits of debate and amendments have been reached , the House holds a vote . If a simple majority , 50 percent plus 1 , votes to advance the bill , it moves out of the House and into the Senate ."
29,The key means of advancing modern legislation is now ________.,"The benefit of attaching the reforms to the budget resolution was that Congress could force an up or down ( yea or nay ) vote on the whole package . Such a packaged bill is called an omnibus bill . 36 Creating and voting for an omnibus bill allows Congress to quickly accomplish policy changes that would have taken many votes and the expending of great political capital over a long period of time .  This and successive similar uses of the budget process convinced many in Congress of the utility of this strategy .   During the contentious and ideologically divided 1990s , the budget process became the common problem-solving mechanism in the legislature , thus laying the groundwork for the way legislation works today . "
30,"When it first leaves the kidney, urine flows through","The kidneys carry out the urinary system ’ s primary functions of filtering the blood and maintaining water and electrolyte balance . The kidneys are composed of millions of filtration units called nephrons . Each nephron is in intimate contact with blood through a specialized capillary bed called the glomerulus ( plural glomeruli ) . Fluids , electrolytes , and molecules from the blood pass from the glomerulus into the nephron , creating the filtrate that becomes urine ( Figure 23.3 ) .  Urine that collects in each kidney empties through a ureter and drains to the urinary bladder , which stores urine .  Urine is released from the bladder to the urethra , which transports it to be excreted from the body through the urinary meatus , the opening of the urethra ."
30,What part of the male urogenital tract is shared by the urinary and reproductive systems?," The male reproductive system ( Figure 23.4 ) is located in close proximity to the urinary system , and the urethra is part of both systems .  The testes are responsible for the production of sperm . The epididymis is a coiled tube that collects sperm from the testes and passes it on to the vas deferens . The epididymis is also the site of sperm maturation after they leave the testes . The seminal vesicles and prostate are accessory glands that produce fluid that supports sperm . During ejaculation , the vas deferens releases this mixture of fluid and sperm , called semen , into the urethra , which extends to the end of the penis ."
30,Which species is not associated with NGU?," Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the STI chlamydia ( Figure 23.11 ) .   While many Chlamydia infections are asymptomatic , chlamydia is a major cause of nongonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) and may also cause epididymitis and orchitis in men .  In women , chlamydia infections can cause urethritis , salpingitis , and PID . In addition , chlamydial infections may be associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer .  Other species associated with NGU include Mycoplasma genitalium , Ureaplasma urealyticum , and Mycoplasma hominis .  These bacteria are commonly found in the normal microbiota of healthy individuals , who may acquire them during birth or through sexual contact , but they can sometimes cause infections leading to urethritis ( in males and females ) or vaginitis and cervicitis ( in females ) . There are two main categories of bacterial urethritis : gonorrheal and nongonococcal .  Gonorrheal urethritis is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is associated with gonorrhea , a common STI .  This cause of urethritis will be discussed in Bacterial Infections of the Reproductive System .  The term nongonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) refers to inflammation of the urethra that is unrelated to N . gonorrhoeae .  In women , NGU is often asymptomatic . In men , NGU is typically a mild disease , but can lead to purulent discharge and dysuria . Because the symptoms are often mild or nonexistent , most infected individuals do not know that they are infected , yet they are carriers of the disease .  Asymptomatic patients also have no reason to seek treatment , and although not common , untreated NGU can spread to the reproductive organs , causing pelvic inflammatory disease and salpingitis in women and epididymitis and prostatitis in men .   Important bacterial pathogens that cause nongonococcal urethritis include Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma genitalium , Ureaplasma urealyticum , and Mycoplasma hominis . "
30,A strain of bacteria associated with a bladder infection shows gram-negative rods. What species is most likely to be the causative agent?," Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli ( most commonly ) , Proteus vulgaris , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Klebsiella pneumoniae cause most bladder infections .   Gram-positive pathogens associated with cystitis include the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus saprophyticus , Enterococcus faecalis , and Streptococcus agalactiae .  Routine manual urinalysis using a urine dipstick or test strip can be used for rapid screening of infection . These test strips ( Figure 23.5 ) are either held in a urine stream or dipped in a sample of urine to test for the presence of nitrites , leukocyte esterase , protein , or blood that can indicate an active bacterial infection . The presence of nitrite may indicate the presence of E . coli or K . pneumonia ; these bacteria produce nitrate reductase , which converts nitrate to nitrite . The leukocyte esterase ( LE ) test detects the presence of neutrophils as an indication of active infection ."
30,Treponemal and non-treponemal serological testing can be used to test for," The recommended methods for diagnosing early syphilis are darkfield or brightfield ( silver stain ) microscopy of tissue or exudate from lesions to detect T . pallidum ( Figure 23.13 ) .   If these methods are not available , two types of serologic tests ( treponemal and nontreponemal ) can be used for a presumptive diagnosis once the spirochete has spread in the body .  Nontreponemal serologic tests include the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory ( VDRL ) and rapid plasma reagin ( RPR ) tests . These are similar screening tests that detect nonspecific antibodies ( those for lipid antigens produced during infection ) rather than those produced against the spirochete . Treponemal serologic tests measure antibodies directed against T . pallidum antigens using particle agglutination ( T . pallidum passive particle agglutination or TP-PA ) , immunofluorescence ( the fluorescent T . pallidum antibody absorption or FTA-ABS ) , various enzyme reactions ( enzyme immunoassays or EIAs ) and chemiluminescence immunoassays ( CIA ) . Confirmatory testing , rather than screening , must be done using treponemal rather than nontreponemal tests because only the former tests for antibodies to spirochete antigens . Both treponemal and nontreponemal tests should be used ( as opposed to just one ) since both tests have limitations than can result in false positives or false negatives ."
30,Lymphogranuloma venereum is caused by serovars of," Certain serovars of C . trachomatis can cause an infection of the lymphatic system in the groin known as lymphogranuloma venereum .  This condition is commonly found in tropical regions and can also co-occur in conjunction with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . After the microbes invade the lymphatic system , buboes ( large lymph nodes , see Figure 23.11 ) form and can burst , releasing pus through the skin . The male genitals can become greatly enlarged and in women the rectum may become narrow .  Chlamydia trachomatis is the causative agent of the STI chlamydia ( Figure 23.11 ) .  While many Chlamydia infections are asymptomatic , chlamydia is a major cause of nongonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) and may also cause epididymitis and orchitis in men . In women , chlamydia infections can cause urethritis , salpingitis , and PID . In addition , chlamydial infections may be associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer ."
30,"The latent stage of syphilis, which may last for years, can occur between"," Tertiary syphilis , which may occur 10 to 20 years after infection , produces the most severe symptoms and can be fatal .  Granulomatous lesions called gummas may develop in a variety of locations , including mucous membranes , bones , and internal organs ( Figure 23.12 ) . Gummas can be large and destructive , potentially causing massive tissue damage . The most deadly lesions are those of the cardiovascular system ( cardiovascular syphilis ) and the central nervous system ( neurosyphilis ) . Cardiovascular syphilis can result in a fatal aortic aneurysm ( rupture of the aorta ) or coronary stenosis ( a blockage of the coronary artery ) . Damage to the central nervous system can cause dementia , personality changes , seizures , general paralysis , speech impairment , loss of vision and hearing , and loss of bowel and bladder control .  After the secondary phase , syphilis can enter a latent phase , in which there are no symptoms but microbial levels remain high .  Blood tests can still detect the disease during latency .  The latent phase can persist for years .  After entering the body , T . pallidum moves rapidly into the bloodstream and other tissues .  If not treated effectively , syphilis progresses through three distinct stages : primary , secondary , and tertiary .  Primary syphilis appears as a single lesion on the cervix , penis , or anus within 10 to 90 days of transmission . Such lesions contain many T . pallidum cells and are highly infectious . The lesion , called a hard chancre , is initially hard and painless , but it soon develops into an ulcerated sore ( Figure 23.12 ) . Localized lymph node swelling may occur as well . In some cases , these symptoms may be relatively mild , and the lesion may heal on its own within two to six weeks . Because the lesions are painless and often occur in hidden locations ( e . g . , the cervix or anus ) , infected individuals sometimes do not notice them ."
30,Genital herpes is most commonly caused by,"There are two herpes simplex virus types .  While herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) is generally associated with oral lesions like cold sores or fever blisters ( see Viral Infections of the Skin and Eyes ) , herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV - 2 ) is usually associated with genital herpes .  However , both viruses can infect either location as well as other parts of the body . Oral-genital contact can spread either virus from the mouth to the genital region or vice versa ."
30,Koilocytes are characteristic of,"Because HPV testing is often conducted concurrently with Pap testing , the most common approach uses a single sample collection within one vial for both . This approach uses liquid-based cytology ( LBC ) . The samples are then used for Pap smear cytology as well as HPV testing and genotyping .  HPV can be recognized in Pap smears by the presence of cells called koilocytes ( called koilocytosis or koilocytotic atypia ) .  Koilocytes have a hyperchromatic atypical nucleus that stains darkly and a high ratio of nuclear material to cytoplasm . There is a distinct clear appearance around the nucleus called a perinuclear halo ( Figure 23.19 ) ."
30,Which oral medication is recommended as an initial topical treatment for genital yeast infections?," Clinical Focus Resolution Vaginal candidiasis is generally treated using topical antifungal medications such as butoconazole , miconazole , clotrimazole , ticonozole , nystatin , or oral fluconazole .  However , it is important to be careful in selecting a treatment for use during pregnancy . Nadia ’ s doctor recommended treatment with topical clotrimazole . This drug is classified as a category B drug by the FDA for use in pregnancy , and there appears to be no evidence of harm , at least in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy . Based on Nadia ’ s particular situation , her doctor thought that it was suitable for very short-term use even though she was still in the first trimester . After a seven-day course of treatment , Nadia ’ s yeast infection cleared . She continued with a normal pregnancy and delivered a healthy baby eight months later .  Topical antifungal medications for vaginal candidiasis include butoconazole , miconazole , clotrimazole , tioconazole , and nystatin .  Oral treatment with fluconazole can be used . There are often no clear precipitating factors for infection , so prevention is difficult ."
30,What is the only common infection of the reproductive tract caused by a protozoan?," Only one major protozoan species causes infections in the urogenital system .   Trichomoniasis , or “ trich , ” is the most common nonviral STI and is caused by a flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis .  T . vaginalis has an undulating membrane and , generally , an amoeboid shape when attached to cells in the vagina . In culture , it has an oval shape ."
30,Which test is preferred for detecting T. vaginalis because of its high sensitivity?,"Microscopic evaluation of wet mounts is an inexpensive and convenient method of diagnosis , but the sensitivity of this method is low ( Figure 23.24 ) .  Nucleic acid amplification testing ( NAAT ) is preferred due to its high sensitivity .   Using wet mounts and then NAAT for those who initially test negative is one option to improve sensitivity .  Samples may be obtained for NAAT using urine , vaginal , or endocervical specimens for women and with urine and urethral swabs for men . It is also possible to use other methods such as the OSOM Trichomonas Rapid Test ( an immunochromatographic test that detects antigen ) and a DNA probe test for multiple species associated with vaginitis ( the Affirm VPII Microbial Identification Test discussed in section 23.5 ) .  16 T . vaginalis is sometimes detected on a Pap test , but this is not considered diagnostic due to high rates of false positives and negatives .   The recommended treatment for trichomoniasis is oral metronidazole or tinidazole .  Sexual partners should be treated as well . 16 Association of Public Health Laboratories . “ Advances in Laboratory Detection of Trichomonas vaginalis , ” 2013 . http://www.aphl.org/AboutAPHL/publications/Documents/ID_2013August_Advances-in-Laboratory-Detection-of-Trichomonas-vaginalis.pdf ."
31,The terms “masculine” and “feminine” refer to a person’s _________.,"The dichotomous view of gender ( the notion that one is either male or female ) is specific to certain cultures and is not universal . In some cultures gender is viewed as fluid . In the past , some anthropologists used the term berdache to refer to individuals who occasionally or permanently dressed and lived as the opposite gender . The practice has been noted among certain Native American tribes ( Jacobs , Thomas , and Lang 1997 ) .  Samoan culture accepts what they refer to as a “ third gender . ” Fa ’ afafine , which translates as “ the way of the woman , ” is a term used to describe individuals who are born biologically male but embody both masculine and feminine traits .  Fa ’ afafines are considered an important part of Samoan culture . Individuals from other cultures may mislabel them as homosexuals because fa ’ afafines have a varied sexual life that may include men or women ( Poasa 1992 ) .  A person ’ s sex , as determined by his or her biology , does not always correspond with his or her gender .  Therefore , the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable . A baby boy who is born with male genitalia will be identified as male .  As he grows , however , he may identify with the feminine aspects of his culture .  Since the term sex refers to biological or physical distinctions , characteristics of sex will not vary significantly between different human societies . For example , all persons of the female sex , in general , regardless of culture , will eventually menstruate and develop breasts that can lactate . Characteristics of gender , on the other hand , may vary greatly between different societies .  For example , in American culture , it is considered feminine ( or a trait of the female gender ) to wear a dress or skirt .   However , in many Middle Eastern , Asian , and African cultures , dresses or skirts ( often referred to as sarongs , robes , or gowns ) can be considered masculine .  The kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make him appear feminine in his culture ."
31,­_______ is/are an individual’s self-conception of being male or female based on his or her association with masculine or feminine gender roles.,"Gender Identity American society allows for some level of flexibility when it comes to acting out gender roles . To a certain extent , men can assume some feminine roles and women can assume some masculine roles without interfering with their gender identity .  Gender identity is an individual ’ s self-conception of being male or female based on his or her association with masculine or feminine gender roles . "
31,Research indicates that individuals are aware of their sexual orientation _______.," According to current scientific understanding , individuals are usually aware of their sexual orientation between middle childhood and early adolescence ( American Psychological Association 2008 ) .  They do not have to participate in sexual activity to be aware of these emotional , romantic , and physical attractions ; people can be celibate and still recognize their sexual orientation . Homosexual women ( also referred to as lesbians ) , homosexual men ( also referred to as gays ) , and bisexuals of both genders may have very different experiences of discovering and accepting their sexual orientation . At the point of puberty , some may be able to claim their sexual orientations while others may be unready or unwilling to make their homosexuality or bisexuality known since it goes against American society ’ s historical norms ( APA 2008 ) ."
31,A person who is biologically female but identifies with the male gender and has undergone surgery to alter her body is considered _______.," Transgendered individuals who wish to alter their bodies through medical interventions such as surgery and hormonal therapy — so that their physical being is better aligned with gender identity — are called transsexuals .  They may also be known as male-to-female ( MTF ) or female-to-male ( FTM ) . Not all transgendered individuals choose to alter their bodies : many will maintain their original anatomy but may present themselves to society as the opposite gender . This is typically done by adopting the dress , hairstyle , mannerisms , or other characteristic typically assigned to the opposite gender . It is important to note that people who cross-dress , or wear clothing that is traditionally assigned to opposite gender , are not necessarily transgendered . Cross-dressing is typically a form of self-expression , entertainment , or personal style , not necessarily an expression against one ’ s assigned gender ( APA 2008 ) ."
31,Which of following is correct regarding the explanation for transgenderism?," There is no single , conclusive explanation for why people are transgendered .  Transgendered expressions and experiences are so diverse that it is difficult to identify their origin . Some hypotheses suggest biological factors such as genetics or prenatal hormone levels as well as social and cultural factors such as childhood and adulthood experiences . Most experts believe that all of these factors contribute to a person ’ s gender identity ( APA 2008 ) ."
31,Which of the following is the best example of a gender stereotype?,"Sociological Research Being Male , Being Female , and Being Healthy In 1971 , Broverman and Broverman conducted a groundbreaking study on the traits mental health workers ascribed to males and females .  When asked to name the characteristics of a female , the list featured words such as unaggressive , gentle , emotional , tactful , less logical , not ambitious , dependent , passive , and neat .   The list of male characteristics featured words such as aggressive , rough , unemotional , blunt , logical , direct , active , and sloppy ( Seem and Clark 2006 ) .  Later , when asked to describe the characteristics of a healthy person ( not gender specific ) , the list was nearly identical to that of a male . Sociology in the Real World Real-Life Freaky Friday What if you had to live as the opposite sex ? If you are a man , imagine that you were forced to wear frilly dresses , dainty shoes , and makeup to special occasions , and you were expected to enjoy romantic comedies and TLC reality shows .  If you are a woman , imagine that you were forced to wear shapeless clothing , put only minimal effort into your personal appearance , not show emotion , and watch countless hours of sporting events and sports-related commentary .  It would be pretty uncomfortable , right ? Well , maybe not .  Many people enjoy participating in activities that are typically associated with the opposite sex and would not mind if some of the cultural expectations for men and women were loosened . "
31,Which of the following is the best example of the role peers play as an agent of socialization for school-aged children?,"Mimicking the actions of significant others is the first step in the development of a separate sense of self ( Mead 1934 ) .  Like adults , children become agents who actively facilitate and apply normative gender expectations to those around them .   When children do not conform to the appropriate gender role , they may face negative sanctions such as being criticized or marginalized by their peers .  Though many of these sanctions are informal , they can be quite severe . For example , a girl who wishes to take karate class instead of dance lessons may be called a “ tomboy ” and face difficulty gaining acceptance from both male and female peer groups ( Ready 2001 ) . Boys , especially , are subject to intense ridicule for gender nonconformity ( Coltrane and Adams 2004 ; Kimmel 2000 ) ."
31,Only women are affected by gender stratification.," Gender stratification through the division of labor is not exclusively American .   According to George Murdock ’ s classic work , Outline of World Cultures ( 1954 ) , all societies classify work by gender .   When a pattern appears in all societies , it is called a cultural universal .   While the phenomenon of assigning work by gender is universal , its specifics are not .   The same task is not assigned to either men or women worldwide .  But the way each task ’ s associated gender is valued is notable . In Murdock ’ s examination of the division of labor among 324 societies around the world , he found that in nearly all cases the jobs assigned to men were given greater prestige ( Murdock and White 1968 ) . Even if the job types were very similar and the differences slight , men ’ s work was still considered more vital ."
31,"According to the symbolic interactionist perspective, we “do gender”:"," Sociologist Charles H . Cooley ’ s concept of the “ looking-glass self ” ( 1902 ) can also be applied to interactionist gender studies .  Cooley suggests that one ’ s determination of self is based mainly on the view of society ( for instance , if society perceives a man as masculine , then that man will perceive himself as masculine ) . When people perform tasks or possess characteristics based on the gender role assigned to them , they are said to be doing gender . This notion is based on the work of West & Zimmerman ( 1987 ) .  Whether we are expressing our masculinity or femininity , West and Zimmerman argue , we are always “ doing gender . ” Thus , gender is something we do or perform , not something we are . "
31,What Western country is thought to be the most liberal in its attitudes toward sex?," Of industrialized nations , Sweden is thought to be the most liberal when it comes to attitudes about sex , including sexual practices and sexual openness .  The country has very few regulations on sexual images in the media , and sex education , which starts around age six , is a compulsory part of Swedish school curricula . Sweden ’ s permissive approach to sex has helped the country avoid some of the major social problems associated with sex . For example , rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease are among the world ’ s lowest ( Grose 2007 ) . It would appear that Sweden is a model for the benefits of sexual freedom and frankness . However , implementing Swedish ideals and policies regarding sexuality in other , more politically conservative , nations would likely be met with resistance ."
31,"Compared to most Western societies, American sexual attitudes are considered _______."," Sexuality around the World Cross-national research on sexual attitudes in industrialized nations reveals that normative standards differ across the world .   For example , several studies have shown that Scandinavian students are more tolerant of premarital sex than are American students ( Grose 2007 ) .   A study of 37 countries reported that non-Western societies — like China , Iran , and India — valued chastity highly in a potential mate , while Western European countries — such as France , the Netherlands , and Sweden — placed little value on prior sexual experiences ( Buss 1989 ) . "
31,Sociologists associate sexuality with _______.," Sexual Attitudes and Practices In the area of sexuality , sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and practices , not on physiology or anatomy .   Sexuality is viewed as a person ’ s capacity for sexual feelings .  Studying sexual attitudes and practices is a particularly interesting field of sociology because sexual behavior is a cultural universal . Throughout time and place , the vast majority of human beings have participated in sexual relationships ( Broude 2003 ) . Each society , however , interprets sexuality and sexual activity in different ways . Many societies around the world have different attitudes about premarital sex , the age of sexual consent , homosexuality , masturbation , and other sexual behaviors that are not consistent with universally cultural norms ( Widmer , Treas and Newcomb 1998 ) . At the same time , sociologists have learned that certain norms ( like disapproval of incest ) are shared among most societies . Likewise , societies generally have norms that reinforce their accepted social system of sexuality ."
31,"According to national surveys, most American parents support which type of sex education program in school?","Much of the debate is over the issue of abstinence . In a 2005 survey , 15 percent of Americans believed that schools should teach abstinence exclusively and should not provide contraceptives or information on how to obtain them .  Forty-six percent believed that schools should institute an abstinence-plus approach , which teaches children that abstinence is best , but still gives information about protected sex .  Thirty-six percent believed that teaching about abstinence is not important and that sex education should focus on sexual safety and responsibility ( NPR 2010 ) ."
31,Which theoretical perspective stresses the importance of regulating sexual behavior to ensure marital cohesion and family stability?," Structural Functionalism When it comes to sexuality , functionalists stress the importance of regulating sexual behavior to ensure marital cohesion and family stability .  Since functionalists identify the family unit as the most integral component in society , they maintain a strict focus on it at all times and argue in favor of social arrangements that promote and ensure family preservation ."
32,Which of the following best describes Roosevelt’s attempts to push his political agenda in the last months of Hoover’s presidency?,"After the landslide election , the country — and Hoover — had to endure the interregnum , the difficult four months between the election and President Roosevelt ’ s inauguration in March 1933 . Congress did not pass a single significant piece of legislation during this period , although Hoover spent much of the time trying to get Roosevelt to commit publicly to a legislative agenda of Hoover ’ s choosing .  Roosevelt remained gracious but refused to begin his administration as the incumbent ’ s advisor without any legal authority necessary to change policy .   Unwilling to tie himself to Hoover ’ s legacy of failed policies , Roosevelt kept quiet when Hoover supported the passage of a national sales tax .  Meanwhile , the country suffered from Hoover ’ s inability to further drive a legislative agenda through Congress . It was the worst winter since the beginning of the Great Depression , and the banking sector once again suffered another round of panics . While Roosevelt kept his distance from the final tremors of the Hoover administration , the country continued to suffer in wait . In part as a response to the challenges of this time , the U . S . Constitution was subsequently amended to reduce the period from election to inauguration to the now-commonplace two months ."
32,Which of the following was not a policy undertaken by the NIRA?," A new government agency , the National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) , was central to this plan , and mandated that businesses accept a code that included minimum wages and maximum work hours .   In order to protect workers from potentially unfair agreements among factory owners , every industry had its own “ code of fair practice ” that included workers ’ rights to organize and use collective bargaining to ensure that wages rose with prices ( Figure 26.8 ) .  Headed by General Hugh S . Johnson , the NRA worked to create over five hundred different codes for different industries . The administration of such a complex plan naturally created its own problems . While codes for key industries such as automotive and steel made sense , Johnson pushed to create similar codes for dog food manufacturers , those who made shoulder pads for women ’ s clothing , and even burlesque shows ( regulating the number of strippers in any one show ) . While Roosevelt hoped the AAA would help farms and farmers , he also sought aid for the beleaguered manufacturing sector . The Emergency Railroad Transportation Act created a national railroad office to encourage cooperation among different railroad companies , hoping to shore up an industry essential to the stability of the manufacturing sector , but one that had been devastated by mismanagement .  More importantly , the NIRA suspended antitrust laws and allowed businesses and industries to work together in order to establish codes of fair competition , including issues of price setting and minimum wages .   New Deal officials believed that allowing these collaborations would help industries stabilize prices and production levels in the face of competitive overproduction and declining profits ; however , at the same time , many felt it important to protect workers from potentially unfair agreements . "
32,What type of help did the CWA provide?,"Roosevelt was aware of the need for immediate help , but he mostly wanted to create more jobs .  FERA overseer Harry Hopkins , who later was in charge of the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , shared this sentiment .   With Hopkins at its helm , the CWA , founded in early 1933 , went on to put millions of men and women to work .  At its peak , there were some four million Americans repairing bridges , building roads and airports , and undertaking other public projects . Another work program was the Civilian Conservation Corps Relief Act ( CCC ) . The CCC provided government jobs for young men aged fourteen to twenty-four who came from relief families . They would earn thirty dollars per month planting trees , fighting forest fires , and refurbishing historic sites and parks , building an infrastructure that families would continue to enjoy for generations to come . Within the first two months , the CCC employed its first 250,000 men and eventually established about twenty-five hundred camps ( Figure 26.6 ) ."
32,Which of the following statements accurately describes Mary McLeod Bethune?,"On the issue of race relations themselves , Roosevelt has a mixed legacy . Within his White House , Roosevelt had a number of African American appointees , although most were in minor positions . Unofficially , Roosevelt relied upon advice from the Federal Council on Negro Affairs , also known as his “ Black Cabinet . ” This group included a young Harvard economist , Dr . Robert Weaver , who subsequently became the nation ’ s first Black cabinet secretary in 1966 , as President Lyndon Johnson ’ s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . Aubrey Williams , the director of the NYA , hired more Black administrators than any other federal agency , and appointed them to oversee projects throughout the country .  One key figure in the NYA was Mary McLeod Bethune ( Figure 26.13 ) , a prominent African American educator tapped by Roosevelt to act as the director of the NYA ’ s Division of Negro Affairs .  Bethune had been a spokesperson and an educator for years ; with this role , she became one of the president ’ s foremost African American advisors . During his presidency , Roosevelt became the first to appoint a Black federal judge , as well as the first commander-in-chief to promote an African American to brigadier general . Most notably , he became the first president to publicly speak against lynching as a “ vile form of collective murder . ”"
32,The Social Security Act borrowed some ideas from which of the following?,"With the implementation of the Second New Deal , Roosevelt also created the country ’ s present-day social safety net .  The Social Security Act established programs intended to help the most vulnerable : the elderly , the unemployed , the disabled , and the young .  It included a pension fund for all retired people — except domestic workers and farmers , which therefore left many women and African Americans beyond the scope of its benefits — over the age of sixty-five , to be paid through a payroll tax on both employee and employer . Related to this act , Congress also passed a law on unemployment insurance , to be funded by a tax on employers , and programs for unwed mothers , as well as for those who were blind , deaf , or disabled .  It is worth noting that some elements of these reforms were pulled from Roosevelt detractors Coughlin and Townsend ; the popularity of their movements gave the president more leverage to push forward this type of legislation . "
32,What was the first New Deal agency to hire women openly?,"For women , Roosevelt ’ s policies and practices had a similarly mixed effect . Wage discrimination in federal jobs programs was rampant , and relief policies encouraged women to remain home and leave jobs open for men . This belief was well in line with the gender norms of the day . Several federal relief programs specifically forbade husbands and wives ’ both drawing jobs or relief from the same agency .  The WPA became the first specific New Deal agency to openly hire women — specifically widows , single women , and the wives of disabled husbands .  While they did not take part in construction projects , these women did undertake sewing projects to provide blankets and clothing to hospitals and relief agencies . Likewise , several women took part in the various Federal One art projects . Despite the obvious gender limitations , many women strongly supported Roosevelt ’ s New Deal , as much for its direct relief handouts for women as for its employment opportunities for men . One such woman was Mary ( Molly ) Dewson . A longtime activist in the women ’ s suffrage movement , Dewson worked for women ’ s rights and ultimately rose to be the Director of the Women ’ s Division of the Democratic Party . Dewson and Mary McLeod Bethune , the national champion of African American education and literacy who rose to the level of Director of the Division of Negro Affairs for the NYA , understood the limitations of the New Deal , but also the opportunities for advancement it presented during very trying times . Rather than lamenting what Roosevelt could not or would not do , they felt , and perhaps rightly so , that Roosevelt would do more than most to help women and African Americans achieve a piece of the new America he was building ."
33,Which of the following is not contained in phylum Chordata?," Chordata also contains two clades of invertebrates : Urochordata and Cephalochordata .  Members of these groups also possess the four distinctive features of chordates at some point during their development .  Vertebrates are members of the kingdom Animalia and the phylum Chordata ( Figure 29.2 ) .  Recall that animals that possess bilateral symmetry can be divided into two groups — protostomes and deuterostomes — based on their patterns of embryonic development . The deuterostomes , whose name translates as “ second mouth , ” consist of two phyla : Chordata and Echinodermata . Echinoderms are invertebrate marine animals that have pentaradial symmetry and a spiny body covering , a group that includes sea stars , sea urchins , and sea cucumbers . The most conspicuous and familiar members of Chordata are vertebrates , but this phylum also includes two groups of invertebrate chordates ."
33,Which group of invertebrates is most closely related to vertebrates?," Based on molecular analysis , vertebrates appear to be more closely related to lancelets ( cephalochordates ) than to tunicates ( urochordates ) among the invertebrate chordates .  This evidence suggests that the cephalochordates diverged from Urochordata and the vertebrates subsequently diverged from the cephalochordates . This hypothesis is further supported by the discovery of a fossil in China from the genus Haikouella . This organism seems to be an intermediate form between cephalochordates and vertebrates . The Haikouella fossils are about 530 million years old and appear similar to modern lancelets . These organisms had a brain and eyes , as do vertebrates , but lack the skull found in craniates . 1 This evidence suggests that vertebrates arose during the Cambrian explosion . Recall that the “ Cambrian explosion ” is the name given to a relatively brief span of time during the Cambrian period during which many animal groups appeared and rapidly diversified . Most modern animal phyla originated during the Cambrian explosion . 1 Chen , J . Y . , Huang , D . Y . , and Li , C . W . , “ An early Cambrian craniate-like chordate , ” Nature 402 ( 1999 ): 518 – 522 , doi : 10.1038 / 990080 . Vertebrates are the largest group of chordates , with more than 62,000 living species . Vertebrates are grouped based on anatomical and physiological traits . More than one classification and naming scheme is used for these animals . Here we will consider the traditional groups Agnatha , Chondrichthyes , Osteichthyes , Amphibia , Reptilia , Aves , and Mammalia , which constitute classes in the subphylum Vertebrata . Many modern authors classify birds within Reptilia , which correctly reflects their evolutionary heritage . We consider them separately only for convenience . Further , we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes , the agnathans , although emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes ( the hagfishes ) and vertebrate jawless fishes ( the lampreys ) ."
33,Members of Chondrichthyes differ from members of Osteichthyes by having a ________.," Members of the clade Osteichthyes , also called bony fishes , are characterized by a bony skeleton .  The vast majority of present-day fishes belong to this group , which consists of approximately 30,000 species , making it the largest class of vertebrates in existence today . The clade Chondrichthyes is diverse , consisting of sharks ( Figure 29.11 ) , rays , and skates , together with sawfishes and a few dozen species of fishes called chimaeras , or “ ghost ” sharks . ” Chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins and a skeleton made of cartilage . This clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle Devonian .  They are thought to be descended from the placoderms , which had skeletons made of bone ; thus , the cartilaginous skeleton of Chondrichthyes is a later development .  Parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of calcium carbonate , but this is not the same as bone ."

33,Which of the following is not true of Acanthostega?,"The fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods : now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago . Evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water , to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land ; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the Devonian period . One of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus Acanthostega .  Acanthostega was aquatic ; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes .   However , it also had four limbs , with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods , including amphibians .  Therefore , it is thought that Acanthostega lived in shallow waters and was an intermediate form between lobe-finned fishes and early , fully terrestrial tetrapods . What preceded Acanthostega ? In 2006 , researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a “ tetrapod-like fish , ” Tiktaalik roseae , which seems to be an intermediate form between fishes having fins and tetrapods having limbs ( Figure 29.15 ) . Tiktaalik likely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million years ago . 2 2 Daeschler , E . B . , Shubin , N . H . , and Jenkins , F . J . “ A Devonian tetrapod-like fish and the evolution of the tetrapod body plan , ” Nature 440 ( 2006 ): 757 – 763 , doi : 10.1038 / nature 04639 , http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/abs/nature04639.html ."
33,Frogs belong to which order?," Frogs are amphibians that belong to the order Anura ( Figure 29.17 ) .  Anurans are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates , with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except Antarctica . Anurans have a body plan that is more specialized for movement . Adult frogs use their hind limbs to jump on land . Frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators , including skin that acts as camouflage . Many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals from glands in the skin that are poisonous to predators ."
33,"During the Mesozoic period, diapsids diverged into_______."," The diapsids diverged into two groups , the Archosauromorpha ( “ ancient lizard form ” ) and the Lepidosauromorpha ( “ scaly lizard form ” ) during the Mesozoic period ( Figure 29.22 ) .   The lepidosaurs include modern lizards , snakes , and tuataras .   The archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators , and the extinct pterosaurs ( “ winged lizard ” ) and dinosaurs ( “ terrible lizard ” ) .  Clade Dinosauria includes birds , which evolved from a branch of dinosaurs . Visual Connection"
33,Squamata includes_______.," Squamata ( “ scaly ” ) arose in the late Permian , and extant species include lizards and snakes .  Both are found on all continents except Antarctica . Lizards and snakes are most closely related to tuataras , both groups having evolved from a lepidosaurian ancestor . Squamata is the largest extant clade of reptiles ( Figure 29.27 ) . Most lizards differ from snakes by having four limbs , although these have been variously lost or significantly reduced in at least 60 lineages . Snakes lack eyelids and external ears , which are present in lizards . Lizard species range in size from chameleons and geckos , which are a few centimeters in length , to the Komodo dragon , which is about 3 meters in length . Most lizards are carnivorous , but some large species , such as iguanas , are herbivores ."
33,A bird or feathered dinosaur is ________.,"Dinosaurs ( including birds ) are further subdivided into two groups , the Saurischia ( “ lizard like ” ) and the Ornithischia ( “ bird like ” ) . Despite the names of these groups , it was not the bird-like dinosaurs that gave rise to modern birds . Rather , Saurischia diverged into two groups : One included the long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs , such as Apatosaurus . The second group , bipedal predators called theropods , includes birds . This course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds , specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones , as well as the presence of the wishbone , formed by the fusing of the clavicles . One important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is Archaeopteryx , which is from the Jurassic period ( Figure 29.33 ) .  Archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs , because it is an intermediate fossil , meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds .  Some scientists propose classifying it as a bird , but others prefer to classify it as a dinosaur .  The fossilized skeleton of Archaeopteryx looks like that of a dinosaur , and it had teeth whereas birds do not , but it also had feathers modified for flight , a trait associated only with birds among modern animals .  Fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist , but the feathers do not have the characteristics of flight feathers . It is still unclear exactly how flight evolved in birds . Two main theories exist , the arboreal ( “ tree ” ) hypothesis and the terrestrial ( “ land ” ) hypothesis . The arboreal hypothesis posits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from branch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight . In contrast to this , the terrestrial hypothesis holds that running was the stimulus for flight , as wings could be used to improve running and then became used for flapping flight . Like the question of how flight evolved , the question of how endothermy evolved in birds still is unanswered . Feathers provide insulation , but this is only beneficial if body heat is being produced internally . Similarly , internal heat production is only viable if insulation is present to retain that heat . It has been suggested that one or the other — feathers or endothermy — evolved in response to some other selective pressure ."
33,Which of the following feather types helps to reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight?,"Feathers not only act as insulation but also allow for flight , enabling the lift and thrust necessary to become airborne . The feathers on a wing are flexible , so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them , reducing the drag on the wing . Flight feathers are asymmetrical , which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight ( Figure 29.30 ) . Two types of flight feathers are found on the wings , primary feathers and secondary feathers . Primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust . Secondary feathers are located closer to the body , attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift .  Contour feathers are the feathers found on the body , and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight .  They create a smooth , aerodynamic surface so that air moves smoothly over the bird ’ s body , allowing for efficient flight ."
33,Eccrine glands produce ________.,"Mammalian integument , or skin , includes secretory glands with various functions . Sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication . Sebaceous glands are located over most of the body .  Eccrine glands produce sweat , or perspiration , which is mainly composed of water .  In most mammals , eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body , and some mammals do not possess them at all . However , in primates , especially humans , sweat figures prominently in thermoregulation , regulating the body through evaporative cooling . Sweat glands are located over most of the body surface in primates . Apocrine glands , or scent glands , secrete substances that are used for chemical communication , such as in skunks . Mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns . While male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands , male marsupials do not . Mammary glands likely are modified sebaceous or eccrine glands , but their evolutionary origin is not entirely clear ."
33,Monotremes include:," There are three living species of monotremes : the platypus and two species of echidnas , or spiny anteaters .  The leathery-beaked platypus belongs to the family Ornithorhynchidae ( “ bird beak ” ) , whereas echidnas belong to the family Tachyglossidae ( “ sticky tongue ” ) ( Figure 29.37 ) . The platypus and one species of echidna are found in Australia , and the other species of echidna is found in New Guinea . Monotremes are unique among mammals as they lay eggs , rather than giving birth to live young . The shells of their eggs are not like the hard shells of birds , but are a leathery shell , similar to the shells of reptile eggs . Monotremes have no teeth ."
33,Which of the following is not an anthropoid?,"Order Primates is divided into two groups : prosimians and anthropoids .  Prosimians include the bush babies of Africa , the lemurs of Madagascar , and the lorises , pottos , and tarsiers of Southeast Asia .   Anthropoids include monkeys , apes , and humans .  In general , prosimians tend to be nocturnal ( in contrast to diurnal anthropoids ) and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids ."
33,"Which of the following is part of a clade believed to have died out, leaving no descendants?","The australopiths had a relatively slender build and teeth that were suited for soft food . In the past several years , fossils of hominids of a different body type have been found and dated to approximately 2.5 million years ago . These hominids , of the genus Paranthropus , were muscular , stood 1.3- 1.4 meters tall , and had large grinding teeth . Their molars showed heavy wear , suggesting that they had a coarse and fibrous vegetarian diet as opposed to the partially carnivorous diet of the australopiths .  Paranthropus includes Paranthropus robustus of South Africa , and Paranthropus aethiopicus and Paranthropus boisei of East Africa .   The hominids in this genus went extinct more than 1 million years ago and are not thought to be ancestral to modern humans , but rather members of an evolutionary branch on the hominin tree that left no descendants . "
34,Which of the following four elements was not essential for creating massive urban growth in late nineteenth-century America?,"As the country grew , certain elements led some towns to morph into large urban centers , while others did not .  The following four innovations proved critical in shaping urbanization at the turn of the century : electric lighting , communication improvements , intracity transportation , and the rise of skyscrapers .  As people migrated for the new jobs , they often struggled with the absence of basic urban infrastructures , such as better transportation , adequate housing , means of communication , and efficient sources of light and energy . Even the basic necessities , such as fresh water and proper sanitation — often taken for granted in the countryside — presented a greater challenge in urban life ."
34,Which of the following did the settlement house movement offer as a means of relief for working-class women?," In the secular sphere , the settlement house movement of the 1890s provided additional relief .  Pioneering women such as Jane Addams in Chicago and Lillian Wald in New York led this early progressive reform movement in the United States , building upon ideas originally fashioned by social reformers in England .  With no particular religious bent , they worked to create settlement houses in urban centers where they could help the working class , and in particular , working-class women , find aid .   Their help included child daycare , evening classes , libraries , gym facilities , and free health care .  Addams opened her now-famous Hull House ( Figure 19.7 ) in Chicago in 1889 , and Wald ’ s Henry Street Settlement opened in New York six years later . The movement spread quickly to other cities , where they not only provided relief to working-class women but also offered employment opportunities for women graduating college in the growing field of social work . Oftentimes , living in the settlement houses among the women they helped , these college graduates experienced the equivalent of living social classrooms in which to practice their skills , which also frequently caused friction with immigrant women who had their own ideas of reform and self-improvement ."
34,Why did African Americans consider moving from the rural South to the urban North following the Civil War?,"A combination of both “ push ” and “ pull ” factors played a role in this movement . Despite the end of the Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth Amendments to the U . S . Constitution ( ending slavery , ensuring equal protection under the law , and protecting the right to vote , respectively ) , African Americans were still subjected to intense racial hatred . The rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War led to increased death threats , violence , and a wave of lynchings . Even after the formal dismantling of the Klan in the late 1870s , racially motivated violence continued . According to researchers at the Tuskegee Institute , there were thirty-five hundred racially motivated lynchings and other murders committed in the South between 1865 and 1900 .  For African Americans fleeing this culture of violence , northern and midwestern cities offered an opportunity to escape the dangers of the South .   In addition to this “ push ” out of the South , African Americans were also “ pulled ” to the cities by factors that attracted them , including job opportunities , where they could earn a wage rather than be tied to a landlord , and the chance to vote ( for men , at least ) , supposedly free from the threat of violence .  Although many lacked the funds to move themselves north , factory owners and other businesses that sought cheap labor assisted the migration . Often , the men moved first then sent for their families once they were ensconced in their new city life . Racism and a lack of formal education relegated these African American workers to many of the lower-paying unskilled or semi-skilled occupations . More than 80 percent of African American men worked menial jobs in steel mills , mines , construction , and meat packing . In the railroad industry , they were often employed as porters or servants ( Figure 19.8 ) . In other businesses , they worked as janitors , waiters , or cooks . African American women , who faced discrimination due to both their race and gender , found a few job opportunities in the garment industry or laundries , but were more often employed as maids and domestic servants . Regardless of the status of their jobs , however , African Americans earned higher wages in the North than they did for the same occupations in the South , and typically found housing to be more available ."
34,"Which of the following is true of late nineteenth-century southern and eastern European immigrants, as opposed to their western and northern European predecessors?","Whatever the reason , these immigrants arrived without the education and finances of the earlier waves of immigrants , and settled more readily in the port towns where they arrived , rather than setting out to seek their fortunes in the West . By 1890 , over 80 percent of the population of New York would be either foreign-born or children of foreign-born parentage .  Other cities saw huge spikes in foreign populations as well , though not to the same degree , due in large part to Ellis Island in New York City being the primary port of entry for most European immigrants arriving in the United States .   The previous waves of immigrants from northern and western Europe , particularly Germany , Great Britain , and the Nordic countries , were relatively well off , arriving in the country with some funds and often moving to the newly settled western territories .  In contrast , the newer immigrants from southern and eastern European countries , including Italy , Greece , and several Slavic countries including Russia , came over due to “ push ” and “ pull ” factors similar to those that influenced the African Americans arriving from the South . Many were “ pushed ” from their countries by a series of ongoing famines , by the need to escape religious , political , or racial persecution , or by the desire to avoid compulsory military service . They were also “ pulled ” by the promise of consistent , wage-earning work . New cities were populated with diverse waves of new arrivals , who came to the cities to seek work in the businesses and factories there . While a small percentage of these newcomers were White Americans seeking jobs , most were made up of two groups that had not previously been factors in the urbanization movement : African Americans fleeing the racism of the farms and former plantations in the South , and southern and eastern European immigrants .  These new immigrants supplanted the previous waves of northern and western European immigrants , who had tended to move west to purchase land .  Unlike their predecessors , the newer immigrants lacked the funds to strike out to the western lands and instead remained in the urban centers where they arrived , seeking any work that would keep them alive ."
34,Which of the following was a popular pastime for working-class urban dwellers?," Working-class residents also found relief in the diverse and omnipresent offerings of popular culture and entertainment in and around cities .  These offerings provided an immediate escape from the squalor and difficulties of everyday life .  As improved means of internal transportation developed , working-class residents could escape the city and experience one of the popular new forms of entertainment — the amusement park .  For example , Coney Island on the Brooklyn shoreline consisted of several different amusement parks , the first of which opened in 1895 ( Figure 19.11 ) . At these parks , New Yorkers enjoyed wild rides , animal attractions , and large stage productions designed to help them forget the struggles of their working-day lives . Freak “ side ” shows fed the public ’ s curiosity about physical deviance . For a mere ten cents , spectators could watch a high-diving horse , take a ride to the moon to watch moon maidens eat green cheese , or witness the electrocution of an elephant , a spectacle that fascinated the public both with technological marvels and exotic wildlife . The treatment of animals in many acts at Coney Island and other public amusement parks drew the attention of middle-class reformers such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . Despite questions regarding the propriety of many of the acts , other cities quickly followed New York ’ s lead with similar , if smaller , versions of Coney Island ’ s attractions ."
34,Which of the following was a disadvantage of machine politics?,"The primary form of relief for working-class urban Americans , and particularly immigrants , came in the form of machine politics . This phrase referred to the process by which every citizen of the city , no matter their ethnicity or race , was a ward resident with an alderman who spoke on their behalf at city hall . When everyday challenges arose , whether sanitation problems or the need for a sidewalk along a muddy road , citizens would approach their alderman to find a solution . The aldermen knew that , rather than work through the long bureaucratic process associated with city hall , they could work within the “ machine ” of local politics to find a speedy , mutually beneficial solution .  In machine politics , favors were exchanged for votes , votes were given in exchange for fast solutions , and the price of the solutions included a kickback to the boss .   In the short term , everyone got what they needed , but the process was neither transparent nor democratic , and it was an inefficient way of conducting the city ’ s business . "
34,Which of the following statements accurately represents Thorstein Veblen’s argument in The Theory of the Leisure Class?," Another critique of late nineteenth-century American capitalism was Thorstein Veblen , who lamented in The Theory of the Leisure Class ( 1899 ) that capitalism created a middle class more preoccupied with its own comfort and consumption than with maximizing production .  In coining the phrase “ conspicuous consumption , ” Veblen identified the means by which one class of nonproducers exploited the working class that produced the goods for their consumption . Such practices , including the creation of business trusts , served only to create a greater divide between the haves and have-nots in American society , and resulted in economic inefficiencies that required correction or reform ."
34,Which of the following was not an element of realism?,"Novelists and journalists also popularized realism in literary works . Authors such as Stephen Crane , who wrote stark stories about life in the slums or during the Civil War , and Rebecca Harding Davis , who in 1861 published Life in the Iron Mills , embodied this popular style . Mark Twain also sought realism in his books , whether it was the reality of the pioneer spirit , seen in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , published in 1884 , or the issue of corruption in The Gilded Age , co-authored with Charles Dudley Warner in 1873 . The narratives and visual arts of these realists could nonetheless be highly stylized , crafted , and even fabricated , since their goal was the effective portrayal of social realities they thought required reform .  Some authors , such as Jack London , who wrote The Call of the Wild , embraced a school of thought called naturalism , which concluded that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only truly relevant laws governing humanity ( Figure 19.17 ) .  Kate Chopin , widely regarded as the foremost woman short story writer and novelist of her day , sought to portray a realistic view of women ’ s lives in late nineteenth-century America , thus paving the way for more explicit feminist literature in generations to come . Although Chopin never described herself as a feminist per se , her reflective works on her experiences as a southern woman introduced a form of creative nonfiction that captured the struggles of women in the United States through their own individual experiences . She also was among the first authors to openly address the race issue of miscegenation . In her work Desiree ’ s Baby , Chopin specifically explores the Creole community of her native Louisiana in depths that exposed the reality of racism in a manner seldom seen in literature of the time .  Other thinkers of the day took Charles Darwin ’ s theories in a more nuanced direction , focusing on different theories of realism that sought to understand the truth underlying the changes in the United States .   These thinkers believed that ideas and social constructs must be proven to work before they could be accepted .   Philosopher William James was one of the key proponents of the closely related concept of pragmatism , which held that Americans needed to experiment with different ideas and perspectives to find the truth about American society , rather than assuming that there was truth in old , previously accepted models .  Only by tying ideas , thoughts , and statements to actual objects and occurrences could one begin to identify a coherent truth , according to James . His work strongly influenced the subsequent avant-garde and modernist movements in literature and art , especially in understanding the role of the observer , artist , or writer in shaping the society they attempted to observe .  John Dewey built on the idea of pragmatism to create a theory of instrumentalism , which advocated the use of education in the search for truth .  Dewey believed that education , specifically observation and change through the scientific method , was the best tool by which to reform and improve American society as it continued to grow ever more complex . To that end , Dewey strongly encouraged educational reforms designed to create an informed American citizenry that could then form the basis for other , much-needed progressive reforms in society .  Political philosopher Herbert Spencer took Darwin ’ s theory of evolution further , coining the actual phrase “ survival of the fittest , ” and later helping to popularize the phrase social Darwinism to posit that society evolved much like a natural organism , wherein some individuals will succeed due to racially and ethnically inherent traits , and their ability to adapt .  This model allowed that a collection of traits and skills , which could include intelligence , inherited wealth , and so on , mixed with the ability to adapt , would let all Americans rise or fall of their own accord , so long as the road to success was accessible to all . William Graham Sumner , a sociologist at Yale , became the most vocal proponent of social Darwinism . Not surprisingly , this ideology , which Darwin himself would have rejected as a gross misreading of his scientific discoveries , drew great praise from those who made their wealth at this time . They saw their success as proof of biological fitness , although critics of this theory were quick to point out that those who did not succeed often did not have the same opportunities or equal playing field that the ideology of social Darwinism purported . Eventually , the concept fell into disrepute in the 1930s and 1940s , as eugenicists began to utilize it in conjunction with their racial theories of genetic superiority ."
35,Which of the following is not considered a current liability?," A note payable is usually classified as a long-term ( noncurrent ) liability if the note period is longer than one year or the standard operating period of the company .  However , during the company ’ s current operating period , any portion of the long-term note due that will be paid in the current period is considered a current portion of a note payable . The outstanding balance note payable during the current period remains a noncurrent note payable . Note that this does not include the interest portion of the payments . On the balance sheet , the current portion of the noncurrent liability is separated from the remaining noncurrent liability . No journal entry is required for this distinction , but some companies choose to show the transfer from a noncurrent liability to a current liability .  Common current liabilities include accounts payable , unearned revenues , the current portion of a note payable , and taxes payable .   Each of these liabilities is current because it results from a past business activity , with a disbursement or payment due within a period of less than a year . "
35,Which of the following best describes a contingent liability that is likely to occur but cannot be reasonably estimated?," If the contingent liability is probable and inestimable , it is likely to occur but cannot be reasonably estimated .  In this case , a note disclosure is required in financial statements , but a journal entry and financial recognition should not occur until a reasonable estimate is possible ."
35,Which of the following best describes a contingent liability that is unlikely to occur?," If the contingent liability is considered remote , it is unlikely to occur and may or may not be estimable .  This does not meet the likelihood requirement , and the possibility of actualization is minimal . In this situation , no journal entry or note disclosure in financial statements is necessary ."
35,Which of the following is not a characteristic of a short-term note payable?," A short-term note payable is a debt created and due within a company ’ s operating period ( less than a year ) .   Some key characteristics of this written promise to pay ( see Figure 12.12 ) include an established date for repayment , a specific payable amount , interest terms , and the possibility of debt resale to another party .   A short-term note is classified as a current liability because it is wholly honored within a company ’ s operating period .   This payable account would appear on the balance sheet under Current Liabilities . "
36,Which of the following is an organism that obtains its energy from the transfer of electrons originating from chemical compounds and its carbon from an inorganic source?,"Carbon is one of the most important elements to living organisms , as shown by its abundance and presence in all organic molecules . The carbon cycle exemplifies the connection between organisms in various ecosystems . Carbon is exchanged between heterotroph s and autotroph s within and between ecosystems primarily by way of atmospheric CO 2 , a fully oxidized version of carbon that serves as the basic building block that autotrophs use to build multicarbon , high-energy organic molecules such as glucose .  Photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs harness energy from the sun and from inorganic chemical compounds , respectively , to covalently bond carbon atoms together into reduced organic compounds whose energy can be later accessed through the processes of respiration and fermentation ( Figure 8.24 ) .  Organisms can also be identified by the energy source they use .  All energy is derived from the transfer of electrons , but the source of electrons differs between various types of organisms .   The prefixes photo - ( “ light ” ) and chemo - ( “ chemical ” ) refer to the energy sources that various organisms use .   Those that get their energy for electron transfer from light are phototroph s , whereas chemotroph s obtain energy for electron transfer by breaking chemical bonds .   There are two types of chemotrophs : organotroph s and lithotroph s .   Organotrophs , including humans , fungi , and many prokaryotes , are chemotrophs that obtain energy from organic compounds .   Lithotrophs ( “ litho ” means “ rock ” ) are chemotrophs that get energy from inorganic compounds , including hydrogen sulfide ( H 2 S ) and reduced iron .  Lithotrophy is unique to the microbial world ."
36,Which of the following molecules is reduced?,"The energy released from the breakdown of the chemical bonds within nutrients can be stored either through the reduction of electron carriers or in the bonds of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . In living systems , a small class of compounds functions as mobile electron carrier s , molecules that bind to and shuttle high-energy electrons between compounds in pathways . The principal electron carriers we will consider originate from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides ; they are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate , and flavin adenine dinucleotide . These compounds can be easily reduced or oxidized . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + / NADH ) is the most common mobile electron carrier used in catabolism . NAD + is the oxidized form of the molecule ; NADH is the reduced form of the molecule .  Nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP + ) , the oxidized form of an NAD + variant that contains an extra phosphate group , is another important electron carrier ; it forms NADPH when reduced .  The oxidized form of flavin adenine dinucleotide is FAD , and its reduced form is FADH 2 . Both NAD + / NADH and FAD / FADH 2 are extensively used in energy extraction from sugars during catabolism in chemoheterotroph s , whereas NADP + / NADPH plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis . Collectively , FADH 2 , NADH , and NADPH are often referred to as having reducing power due to their ability to donate electrons to various chemical reactions ."
36,Enzymes work by which of the following?, An enzyme functions by lowering the activation energy of a chemical reaction inside the cell .  Activation energy is the energy needed to form or break chemical bonds and convert reactants to products ( Figure 8.5 ) . Enzymes lower the activation energy by binding to the reactant molecules and holding them in such a way as to speed up the reaction .
36,To which of the following does a competitive inhibitor most structurally resemble?,"Enzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity . There are many different kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function , and various mechanisms exist for doing so ( Figure 8.8 ) .  A competitive inhibitor is a molecule similar enough to a substrate that it can compete with the substrate for binding to the active site by simply blocking the substrate from binding .   For a competitive inhibitor to be effective , the inhibitor concentration needs to be approximately equal to the substrate concentration .  Sulfa drugs provide a good example of competitive competition . They are used to treat bacterial infections because they bind to the active site of an enzyme within the bacterial folic acid synthesis pathway . When present in a sufficient dose , a sulfa drug prevents folic acid synthesis , and bacteria are unable to grow because they cannot synthesize DNA , RNA , and proteins . Humans are unaffected because we obtain folic acid from our diets ."
36,Which of the following are organic molecules that help enzymes work correctly?," Coenzymes are organic helper molecules that are required for enzyme action .  Like enzymes , they are not consumed and , hence , are reusable . The most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins . Some vitamins are precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes . Many enzyme s do not work optimally , or even at all , unless bound to other specific nonprotein helper molecules , either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds .  Binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes .   Two types of helper molecules are cofactor s and coenzyme s . Cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron ( Fe 2 + ) and magnesium ( Mg 2 + ) that help stabilize enzyme conformation and function .  One example of an enzyme that requires a metal ion as a cofactor is the enzyme that builds DNA molecules , DNA polymerase , which requires a bound zinc ion ( Zn 2 + ) to function ."
36,During which of the following is ATP not made by substrate-level phosphorylation?,"The Krebs cycle transfers remaining electrons from the acetyl group produced during the transition reaction to electron carrier molecules , thus reducing them .  The Krebs cycle also occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes along with glycolysis and the transition reaction , but it takes place in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotic cells where the transition reaction also occurs .  The Krebs cycle is named after its discoverer , British scientist Hans Adolf Krebs ( 1900 – 1981 ) and is also called the citric acid cycle , or the tricarboxylic acid cycle ( TCA ) because citric acid has three carboxyl groups in its structure . Unlike glycolysis , the Krebs cycle is a closed loop : The last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step ( Figure 8.13 ) .  The eight steps of the cycle are a series of chemical reactions that capture the two-carbon acetyl group ( the CoA carrier does not enter the Krebs cycle ) from the transition reaction , which is added to a four-carbon intermediate in the Krebs cycle , producing the six-carbon intermediate citric acid ( giving the alternate name for this cycle ) .  As one turn of the cycle returns to the starting point of the four-carbon intermediate , the cycle produces two CO 2 molecules , one ATP molecule ( or an equivalent , such as guanosine triphosphate [ GTP ] ) produced by substrate-level phosphorylation , and three molecules of NADH and one of FADH 2 . ( A discussion and detailed illustration of the full Krebs cycle appear in Appendix C . )"
36,"During the catabolism of glucose, which of the following is produced only in the Krebs cycle?"," The Krebs cycle transfers remaining electrons from the acetyl group produced during the transition reaction to electron carrier molecules , thus reducing them .  The Krebs cycle also occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes along with glycolysis and the transition reaction , but it takes place in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotic cells where the transition reaction also occurs .

( A discussion and detailed illustration of the full Krebs cycle appear in Appendix C . )"
36,"Which of the following is not a name for the cycle resulting in the conversion of a two-carbon acetyl to one ATP, two CO2, one FADH2, and three NADH molecules?","The Krebs cycle transfers remaining electrons from the acetyl group produced during the transition reaction to electron carrier molecules , thus reducing them . The Krebs cycle also occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes along with glycolysis and the transition reaction , but it takes place in the mitochondrial matrix of eukaryotic cells where the transition reaction also occurs .

36,Which is the location of electron transports systems in prokaryotes?,"In each transfer of an electron through the ETS , the electron loses energy , but with some transfers , the energy is stored as potential energy by using it to pump hydrogen ions ( H + ) across a membrane .  In prokaryotic cells , H + is pumped to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane ( called the periplasmic space in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria ) , and in eukaryotic cells , they are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space .  There is an uneven distribution of H + across the membrane that establishes an electrochemical gradient because H + ions are positively charged ( electrical ) and there is a higher concentration ( chemical ) on one side of the membrane . This electrochemical gradient formed by the accumulation of H + ( also known as a proton ) on one side of the membrane compared with the other is referred to as the proton motive force ( PMF ) . Because the ions involved are H + , a pH gradient is also established , with the side of the membrane having the higher concentration of H + being more acidic . Beyond the use of the PMF to make ATP , as discussed in this chapter , the PMF can also be used to drive other energetically unfavorable processes , including nutrient transport and flagella rotation for motility ."
36,Which is the source of the energy used to make ATP by oxidative phosphorylation?,"The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies . For example , the number of hydrogen ions that the electron transport system complexes can pump through the membrane varies between different species of organisms .  In aerobic respiration in mitochondria , the passage of electrons from one molecule of NADH generates enough proton motive force to make three ATP molecules by oxidative phosphorylation , whereas the passage of electrons from one molecule of FADH 2 generates enough proton motive force to make only two ATP molecules .  Thus , the 10 NADH molecules made per glucose during glycolysis , the transition reaction , and the Krebs cycle carry enough energy to make 30 ATP molecules , whereas the two FADH 2 molecules made per glucose during these processes provide enough energy to make four ATP molecules . Overall , the theoretical maximum yield of ATP made during the complete aerobic respiration of glucose is 38 molecules , with four being made by substrate-level phosphorylation and 34 being made by oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 8.16 ) . In reality , the total ATP yield is usually less , ranging from one to 34 ATP molecules , depending on whether the cell is using aerobic respiration or anaerobic respiration ; in eukaryotic cells , some energy is expended to transport intermediates from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria , affecting ATP yield ."
36,A cell might perform anaerobic respiration for which of the following reasons?," The cell lacks genes encoding an appropriate cytochrome oxidase for transferring electrons to oxygen at the end of the electron transport system .   There are many circumstances under which aerobic respiration is not possible , including any one or more of the following : "
36,"In prokaryotes, which of the following is true?"," In each transfer of an electron through the ETS , the electron loses energy , but with some transfers , the energy is stored as potential energy by using it to pump hydrogen ions ( H + ) across a membrane .   In prokaryotic cells , H + is pumped to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane ( called the periplasmic space in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria ) , and in eukaryotic cells , they are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space .

Beyond the use of the PMF to make ATP , as discussed in this chapter , the PMF can also be used to drive other energetically unfavorable processes , including nutrient transport and flagella rotation for motility ."
36,Which of the following is not an electron carrier within an electron transport system?,"Once the light harvesting complex transfers the energy to the reaction center , the reaction center delivers its high-energy electrons , one by one , to an electron carrier in an electron transport system , and electron transfer through the ETS is initiated . The ETS is similar to that used in cellular respiration and is embedded within the photosynthetic membrane . Ultimately , the electron is used to produce NADH or NADPH .  The electrochemical gradient that forms across the photosynthetic membrane is used to generate ATP by chemiosmosis through the process of photophosphorylation , another example of oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 8.21 ) .   The electron transport system ( ETS ) is the last component involved in the process of cellular respiration ; it comprises a series of membrane-associated protein complexes and associated mobile accessory electron carriers ( Figure 8.15 ) .  Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons from NADH and FADH 2 are passed rapidly from one ETS electron carrier to the next . These carriers can pass electrons along in the ETS because of their redox potential . For a protein or chemical to accept electrons , it must have a more positive redox potential than the electron donor . Therefore , electrons move from electron carriers with more negative redox potential to those with more positive redox potential .  The four major classes of electron carriers involved in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic electron transport systems are the cytochrome s , flavoprotein s , iron-sulfur protein s , and the quinone s . In aerobic respiration , the final electron acceptor ( i . e . , the one having the most positive redox potential ) at the end of the ETS is an oxygen molecule ( O 2 ) that becomes reduced to water ( H 2 O ) by the final ETS carrier .   This electron carrier , cytochrome oxidase , differs between bacterial types and can be used to differentiate closely related bacteria for diagnoses .  For example , the gram-negative opportunist Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-negative cholera-causing Vibrio cholerae use cytochrome c oxidase , which can be detected by the oxidase test , whereas other gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae , like E . coli , are negative for this test because they produce different cytochrome oxidase types ."
36,Which of the following is the purpose of fermentation?," Beyond lactic acid fermentation and alcohol fermentation , many other fermentation methods occur in prokaryotes , all for the purpose of ensuring an adequate supply of NAD + for glycolysis ( Table 8.3 ) .  Without these pathways , glycolysis would not occur and no ATP would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose . It should be noted that most forms of fermentation besides homolactic fermentation produce gas , commonly CO 2 and / or hydrogen gas . Many of these different types of fermentation pathways are also used in food production and each results in the production of different organic acids , contributing to the unique flavor of a particular fermented food product . The propionic acid produced during propionic acid fermentation contributes to the distinctive flavor of Swiss cheese , for example ."
36,Which molecule typically serves as the final electron acceptor during fermentation?,"If respiration does not occur , NADH must be reoxidized to NAD + for reuse as an electron carrier for glycolysis , the cell ’ s only mechanism for producing any ATP , to continue .  Some living systems use an organic molecule ( commonly pyruvate ) as a final electron acceptor through a process called fermentation .  Fermentation does not involve an electron transport system and does not directly produce any additional ATP beyond that produced during glycolysis by substrate-level phosphorylation . Organisms carrying out fermentation , called fermenters , produce a maximum of two ATP molecules per glucose during glycolysis . Table 8.2 compares the final electron acceptors and methods of ATP synthesis in aerobic respiration , anaerobic respiration , and fermentation . Note that the number of ATP molecules shown for glycolysis assumes the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway . The number of ATP molecules made by substrate-level phosphorylation ( SLP ) versus oxidative phosphorylation ( OP ) are indicated ."
36,Which fermentation product is important for making bread rise?,"Another familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation , which produces ethanol . The ethanol fermentation reaction is shown in Figure 8.17 . In the first reaction , the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase removes a carboxyl group from pyruvate , releasing CO 2 gas while producing the two-carbon molecule acetaldehyde . The second reaction , catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase , transfers an electron from NADH to acetaldehyde , producing ethanol and NAD + .  The ethanol fermentation of pyruvate by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used in the production of alcoholic beverages and also makes bread products rise due to CO 2 production .  Outside of the food industry , ethanol fermentation of plant products is important in biofuel production ."
36,Which of the following is not a commercially important fermentation product?,"Several fermentation products are important commercially outside of the food industry .  For example , chemical solvents such as acetone and butanol are produced during acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation .   Complex organic pharmaceutical compounds used in antibiotics ( e . g . , penicillin ) , vaccines , and vitamins are produced through mixed acid fermentation .  Fermentation products are used in the laboratory to differentiate various bacteria for diagnostic purposes . For example , enteric bacteria are known for their ability to perform mixed acid fermentation , reducing the pH , which can be detected using a pH indicator . Similarly , the bacterial production of acetoin during butanediol fermentation can also be detected . Gas production from fermentation can also be seen in an inverted Durham tube that traps produced gas in a broth culture .  Another familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation , which produces ethanol .  The ethanol fermentation reaction is shown in Figure 8.17 . In the first reaction , the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase removes a carboxyl group from pyruvate , releasing CO 2 gas while producing the two-carbon molecule acetaldehyde .

36,Which of the following molecules is not produced during the breakdown of phospholipids?," The resulting products of lipid catabolism , glycerol and fatty acids , can be further degraded .   Glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol - 3 - phosphate and easily converted to glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate , which continues through glycolysis .   The released fatty acids are catabolized in a process called β-oxidation , which sequentially removes two-carbon acetyl groups from the ends of fatty acid chains , reducing NAD + and FAD to produce NADH and FADH 2 , respectively , whose electrons can be used to make ATP by oxidative phosphorylation .   The acetyl groups produced during β-oxidation are carried by coenzyme A to the Krebs cycle , and their movement through this cycle results in their degradation to CO 2 , producing ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and additional NADH and FADH 2 molecules ( see Appendix C for a detailed illustration of β-oxidation ) . "
36,Caseinase is which type of enzyme?,"Proteins are degraded through the concerted action of a variety of microbial protease enzymes .  Extracellular proteases cut proteins internally at specific amino acid sequences , breaking them down into smaller peptides that can then be taken up by cells .  Some clinically important pathogens can be identified by their ability to produce a specific type of extracellular protease . For example , the production of the extracellular protease gelatinase by members of the genera Proteus and Serratia can be used to distinguish them from other gram-negative enteric bacteria . Following inoculation and growth of microbes in gelatin broth , degradation of the gelatin protein due to gelatinase production prevents solidification of gelatin when refrigerated . Other pathogens can be distinguished by their ability to degrade casein , the main protein found in milk .  When grown on skim milk agar , production of the extracellular protease caseinase causes degradation of casein , which appears as a zone of clearing around the microbial growth .  Caseinase production by the opportunist pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be used to distinguish it from other related gram-negative bacteria ."
36,Which of the following is the first step in triglyceride degradation?," Triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals .  They are made of glycerol and three fatty acids ( see Figure 7.12 ) . Phospholipids compose the cell and organelle membranes of all organisms except the archaea . Phospholipid structure is similar to triglycerides except that one of the fatty acids is replaced by a phosphorylated head group ( see Figure 7.13 ) .  Triglycerides and phospholipids are broken down first by releasing fatty acid chains ( and / or the phosphorylated head group , in the case of phospholipids ) from the three-carbon glycerol backbone .  The reactions breaking down triglycerides are catalyzed by lipases and those involving phospholipids are catalyzed by phospholipases . These enzymes contribute to the virulence of certain microbes , such as the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans . These microbes use phospholipases to destroy lipids and phospholipids in host cells and then use the catabolic products for energy ( see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens ) ."
36,"During the light-dependent reactions, which molecule loses an electron?"," Photosynthetic pigments within the photosynthetic membranes are organized into photosystem s , each of which is composed of a light-harvesting ( antennae ) complex and a reaction center .  The light-harvesting complex consists of multiple proteins and associated pigments that each may absorb light energy and , thus , become excited . This energy is transferred from one pigment molecule to another until eventually ( after about a millionth of a second ) it is delivered to the reaction center . Up to this point , only energy — not electrons — has been transferred between molecules .  The reaction center contains a pigment molecule that can undergo oxidation upon excitation , actually giving up an electron .   It is at this step in photosynthesis that light energy is converted into an excited electron .   Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages : the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions ( Figure 8.19 ) .   In the light-dependent reaction s , energy from sunlight is absorbed by pigment molecules in photosynthetic membranes and converted into stored chemical energy .  In the light-independent reaction s , the chemical energy produced by the light-dependent reactions is used to drive the assembly of sugar molecules using CO 2 ; however , these reactions are still light dependent because the products of the light-dependent reactions necessary for driving them are short-lived . The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and either NADPH or NADH to temporarily store energy . These energy carriers are used in the light-independent reactions to drive the energetically unfavorable process of “ fixing ” inorganic CO 2 in an organic form , sugar ."
36,"In prokaryotes, in which direction are hydrogen ions pumped by the electron transport system of photosynthetic membranes?"," In each transfer of an electron through the ETS , the electron loses energy , but with some transfers , the energy is stored as potential energy by using it to pump hydrogen ions ( H + ) across a membrane .   In prokaryotic cells , H + is pumped to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane ( called the periplasmic space in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria ) , and in eukaryotic cells , they are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space .  There is an uneven distribution of H + across the membrane that establishes an electrochemical gradient because H + ions are positively charged ( electrical ) and there is a higher concentration ( chemical ) on one side of the membrane . This electrochemical gradient formed by the accumulation of H + ( also known as a proton ) on one side of the membrane compared with the other is referred to as the proton motive force ( PMF ) . Because the ions involved are H + , a pH gradient is also established , with the side of the membrane having the higher concentration of H + being more acidic . Beyond the use of the PMF to make ATP , as discussed in this chapter , the PMF can also be used to drive other energetically unfavorable processes , including nutrient transport and flagella rotation for motility ."
36,Which of the following does not occur during cyclic photophosphorylation in cyanobacteria?,"Photosystems have been classified into two types : photosystem I ( PSI ) and photosystem II ( PSII ) ( Figure 8.23 ) . Cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts have both photosystems , whereas anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria use only one of the photosystems . Both photosystems are excited by light energy simultaneously .  If the cell requires both ATP and NADPH for biosynthesis , then it will carry out noncyclic photophosphorylation .  Upon passing of the PSII reaction center electron to the ETS that connects PSII and PSI , the lost electron from the PSII reaction center is replaced by the splitting of water . The excited PSI reaction center electron is used to reduce NADP + to NADPH and is replaced by the electron exiting the ETS . The flow of electrons in this way is called the Z-scheme ."
36,Which of the following are two products of the light-dependent reactions?,"Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages : the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions ( Figure 8.19 ) . In the light-dependent reaction s , energy from sunlight is absorbed by pigment molecules in photosynthetic membranes and converted into stored chemical energy .  In the light-independent reaction s , the chemical energy produced by the light-dependent reactions is used to drive the assembly of sugar molecules using CO 2 ; however , these reactions are still light dependent because the products of the light-dependent reactions necessary for driving them are short-lived .   The light-dependent reactions produce ATP and either NADPH or NADH to temporarily store energy .  These energy carriers are used in the light-independent reactions to drive the energetically unfavorable process of “ fixing ” inorganic CO 2 in an organic form , sugar ."
36,"Which of the following is the group of archaea that can use CO2 as their final electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration, producing CH4?"," Bacteria and archaea that use methane as their carbon source are called methanotroph s . Reduced one-carbon compounds like methane accumulate in certain anaerobic environments when CO 2 is used as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration by archaea called methanogen s . Some methanogens also ferment acetate ( two carbons ) to produce methane and CO 2 .  Methane accumulation due to methanogenesis occurs in both natural anaerobic soil and aquatic environments ; methane accumulation also occurs as a result of animal husbandry because methanogens are members of the normal microbiota of ruminants . Environmental methane accumulation due to methanogenesis is of consequence because it is a strong greenhouse gas , and methanotrophs help to reduce atmospheric methane levels ."
36,Which of the following processes is not involved in the conversion of organic nitrogen to nitrogen gas?," The nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is eventually converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by microbes through three steps : ammonification , nitrification , and denitrification .  In terrestrial systems , the first step is the ammonification process , in which certain bacteria and fungi convert nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead organisms into ammonia ( NH 3 ) . This ammonia is then oxidized to nitrite ( NO 2 − ) , ( NO 2 − ) , then to nitrate ( NO 3 − ) , ( NO 3 − ) , by nitrifying soil bacteria such as members of the genus Nitrosomonas , through the process of nitrification . Last , the process of denitrification occurs , whereby soil bacteria , such as members of the genera Pseudomonas and Clostridium , use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in anaerobic respiration , converting it into nitrogen gas that reenters the atmosphere . A similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle , where these three processes are performed by marine bacteria and archaea ."
36,Which of the following processes produces hydrogen sulfide?,"Sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living organisms . As part of the amino acids cysteine and methionine , it is involved in the formation of proteins . It is also found in several vitamins necessary for the synthesis of important biological molecules like coenzyme A . Several groups of microbes are responsible for carrying out processes involved in the sulfur cycle ( Figure 8.26 ) . Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria as well as chemoautotrophic archaea and bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor , oxidizing it first to elemental sulfur ( S 0 ) , then to sulfate ( SO 4 2 − ) . ( SO 4 2 − ) .  This leads to stratification of hydrogen sulfide in soil , with levels increasing at deeper , more anaerobic depths . "
36,The biogeochemical cycle of which of the following elements is based on changes in solubility rather than redox chemistry?," Beyond their involvement in the carbon , nitrogen , and sulfur cycles , prokaryotes are involved in other biogeochemical cycles as well .  Like the carbon , nitrogen , and sulfur cycles , several of these additional biogeochemical cycles , such as the iron ( Fe ) , manganese ( Mn ) , and chromium ( Cr ) cycles , also involve redox chemistry , with prokaryotes playing roles in both oxidation and reduction .  Several other elements undergo chemical cycles that do not involve redox chemistry .   Examples of these are phosphorus ( P ) , calcium ( Ca ) , and silica ( Si ) cycles .  The cycling of these elements is particularly important in oceans because large quantities of these elements are incorporated into the exoskeletons of marine organisms .  These biogeochemical cycle s do not involve redox chemistry but instead involve fluctuations in the solubility of compounds containing calcium , phosphorous , and silica .  The overgrowth of naturally occurring microbial communities is typically limited by the availability of nitrogen ( as previously mentioned ) , phosphorus , and iron . Human activities introducing excessive amounts of iron , nitrogen , or phosphorus ( typically from detergents ) may lead to eutrophication ."
37,When an individual creates and promotes malicious falsehoods about another that individual may be liable for:," Defamation occurs when an individual intentionally creates and promotes malicious falsehoods about another .   Defamation can occur in two ways : slander and libel .  Slander is , in effect , when falsehoods are spoken . Libel occurs when falsehoods are expressed in written or other recorded forums ."
37,All of the following are elements of negligence except:," Intentional torts and negligence arise based on intentional and unintentional acts committed by individuals .  Damages are decided in civil courts by first determining fault and harm , and then by assigning a remedy . Sometimes , the damage can be excused if the circumstances indicate that the defendant acted with permission , or in his or her own defense .  The main standard used to make a decision is the reasonable standard of care : what would a reasonable person do ?  6.2 Product and Strict Liability"
37,Which of the following is a special relationship giving rise to a duty to act to aid or protect one in peril?," In some cases , the duty of care is based on a special relationship , which is a relationship based on an implied duty of care .   This implied duty of care often comes about as a duty to aid , or a duty to protect another , e . g . , a nurse caring for patients in a hospital , or a lifeguard being responsible for swimmers in the guarded area ( Baime , 2018 ) .  A passerby does not have a duty to aid , but if the individual tries to help , then he or she is responsible for acting responsibly ."
37,The elements of res ipsa loquitor that a plaintiff must establish in a product liability lawsuit include all of the following except:," The behavior of the plaintiff did not significantly contribute to the harm caused .   Under normal use and circumstances , the product would not cause damage or harm , but damage or harm has occurred in the case in question .   The defendant had control over the product in question while it was being manufactured .  It is not always possible to conclusively prove that an act or omission was responsible for the harm ( Baime , 2018 ) .  As a result , the courts developed the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor , which means that whatever it is speaks for itself .   The burden of proof shifts from the plaintiff to the defendant , who must disprove negligence .   However , the plaintiff must first establish three factors ( Baime , 2018 ): "
38,Which of the following is not a part of budgeting?," As you ’ ve learned , an advantage of budgeting is evaluating performance .  Having a strong understanding of their budgets helps managers keep track of expenses and work toward the company ’ s goals .  Companies need to understand their revenue and expense details to develop budgets as a tool for planning operations and cash flow .   Part of understanding revenue and expenses is evaluating the prior year .  Did the company earn the expected profit ? Could it have earned a higher profit ? What expenses or revenues were not on the budget ?  Critically evaluating the actual results versus the estimated budgetary results can help management plan for the future .   Variance analysis helps the manager analyze its results .   It does not necessarily find a problem , but it does indicate where a problem may exist .  The same is true for favorable variances as well as unfavorable variances . A favorable variance occurs when revenue is higher than budgeted or expenses are lower than budgeted . An unfavorable variance is when revenue is lower than budgeted or expenses are higher than budgeted ."
38,Which of the following is an operating budget?,"The master budget has two major categories : the financial budget and the operating budget . The financial budget plans the use of assets and liabilities and results in a projected balance sheet .  The operating budget helps plan future revenue and expenses and results in a projected income statement .   The operating budget has several subsidiary budgets that all begin with projected sales .   For example , management estimates sales for the upcoming few years .   It then breaks down estimated sales into quarters , months , and weeks and prepares the sales budget .  The sales budget is the foundation for other operating budgets . Management uses the number of units from the sales budget and the company ’ s inventory policy to determine how many units need to be produced .  This information in units and in dollars becomes the production budget . "
38,Which of the following is a finance budget?," A financial budget consists of the cash budget , the budgeted balance sheet , and the budget for capital expenses .  Similar to the individual budgets that make up the operating budgets , the financial budgets serve to assist with planning and monitoring the financing requirements of the organization . Management plans its capital asset needs and states them in the capital expense budget . Management addresses its collection and payment policies to determine when it will receive cash from sales and when it will pay the material , labor , and overhead expenses . The capital expense budget and the estimated payment and collection of cash allow management to build a cash budget and determine when it will need financing or have additional funds to pay back loans . These budgets taken together will be part of the budgeted balance sheet . Figure 7.6 shows how these budgets relate ."
38,Which approach requires management to justify all its expenditures?," Zero-based budgeting begins with zero dollars and then adds to the budget only revenues and expenses that can be supported or justified .  Figure 7.3 illustrates the difference between traditional budget preparation and zero-based budgeting in a bottom-up budgeting scenario .  The advantage to zero-based budgeting is that unnecessary expenses are eliminated because managers cannot justify them .  The drawback is that every expense needs to be justified , including obvious ones , so it takes a lot of time to complete . A compromise tactic is to use a zero-based budgeting approach for certain expenses , like travel , that can be easily justified and linked to the company goals ."
38,Which of the following is true in a bottom-up budgeting approach?," The bottom-up approach ( sometimes also named a self-imposed or participative budget ) begins at the lowest level of the company .   After senior management has communicated the expected departmental goals , the departments then plans and predicts their sales and estimates the amount of resources needed to reach these goals .   This information is communicated to the supervisor , who then passes it on to upper levels of management .  The advantages of this approach are that managers feel their work is valued and that knowledgeable individuals develop the budget with realistic numbers . Therefore , the budget is more likely to be attainable . The drawback is that managers may not fully understand or may misunderstand the strategic plan ."
38,The most common budget is prepared for a ________.,"All budgets are quantitative plans for the future and will be constructed based on the needs of the organization for which the budget is being created . Depending on the complexity , some budgets can take months or even years to develop .  The most common time period covered by a budget is one year , although the time period may vary from strategic , long-term budgets to very detailed , short-term budgets .  Generally , the closer the company is to the start of the budget ’ s time period , the more detailed the budget becomes ."
38,Which of the operating budgets is prepared first?,"The master budget has two major categories : the financial budget and the operating budget . The financial budget plans the use of assets and liabilities and results in a projected balance sheet . The operating budget helps plan future revenue and expenses and results in a projected income statement .  The operating budget has several subsidiary budgets that all begin with projected sales .   For example , management estimates sales for the upcoming few years .   It then breaks down estimated sales into quarters , months , and weeks and prepares the sales budget .   The sales budget is the foundation for other operating budgets .  Management uses the number of units from the sales budget and the company ’ s inventory policy to determine how many units need to be produced . This information in units and in dollars becomes the production budget ."
38,The direct materials budget is prepared using which budget’s information?,"The cash payments schedule , on the other hand , shows when cash will be used to pay for Accounts Payable . One such example are direct material purchases , which originates from the direct materials budget .  When the production budget is determined from the sales , management prepares the direct materials budget to determine when and how much material needs to be ordered .  Orders for materials take place throughout the quarter , and payments for the purchases are made at different intervals from the orders . A schedule of cash payments is similar to the cash collections schedule , except that it accounts for the company ’ s purchases instead of the company ’ s sales . The information from the cash payments schedule feeds into the cash budget . Similar to the production budget , management wants to have an ending inventory available to ensure there are enough materials on hand .  The direct materials budget illustrates how much material needs to be ordered and how much that material costs .  The calculation is similar to that used in the production budget , with the addition of the cost per unit . From the production budget , management knows how many units need to be produced in each budget period .  Management is already aware of how much material it needs to produce each unit and can combine the direct material per unit with the production budget to compute the direct materials budget .   This information is used to ensure the correct quantity of materials is ordered and the correct amount is budgeted for those materials . "
38,Which of the following is not an operating budget?," The production budget is then broken up into budgets for materials , labor , and overhead , which use the standard quantity and standard price for raw materials that need to be purchased , the standard direct labor rate and the standard direct labor hours that need to be scheduled , and the standard costs for all other direct and indirect operating expenses .  Companies use the historic quantities of the amount of material per unit and the hours of direct labor per unit to compute a standard used to estimate the quantity of materials and labor hours needed for the expected level of production . Current costs are used to develop standard costs for the price of materials , the direct labor rate , as well as an estimate of overhead costs . The master budget has two major categories : the financial budget and the operating budget . The financial budget plans the use of assets and liabilities and results in a projected balance sheet . The operating budget helps plan future revenue and expenses and results in a projected income statement .  The operating budget has several subsidiary budgets that all begin with projected sales .   For example , management estimates sales for the upcoming few years .  It then breaks down estimated sales into quarters , months , and weeks and prepares the sales budget .  The sales budget is the foundation for other operating budgets .  Management uses the number of units from the sales budget and the company ’ s inventory policy to determine how many units need to be produced .  This information in units and in dollars becomes the production budget . "
38,Which of the following statements is not correct?," From the production budget , management knows how many units need to be produced in each budget period .   Management is already aware of how much material it needs to produce each unit and can combine the direct material per unit with the production budget to compute the direct materials budget .  This information is used to ensure the correct quantity of materials is ordered and the correct amount is budgeted for those materials ."
38,The units required in production each period are computed by which of the following methods?," When determining the number of units needed to be produced , start with the estimated sales plus the desired ending inventory to derive the maximum number of units that must be available during the period .   Since the number of units in beginning inventory are already produced , subtracting the beginning inventory from the goods available results in the number of units that need to be produced . "
38,The cash budget is part of which category of budgets?," Preparing a financial budget first requires preparing the capital asset budget , the cash budgets , and the budgeted balance sheet .  The capital asset budget represents a significant investment in cash , and the amount is carried to the cash budget . Therefore , it needs to be prepared before the cash budget . If the cash will not be available , the capital asset budget can be adjusted and , again , carried to the cash budget .  A financial budget consists of the cash budget , the budgeted balance sheet , and the budget for capital expenses .  Similar to the individual budgets that make up the operating budgets , the financial budgets serve to assist with planning and monitoring the financing requirements of the organization . Management plans its capital asset needs and states them in the capital expense budget . Management addresses its collection and payment policies to determine when it will receive cash from sales and when it will pay the material , labor , and overhead expenses . The capital expense budget and the estimated payment and collection of cash allow management to build a cash budget and determine when it will need financing or have additional funds to pay back loans . These budgets taken together will be part of the budgeted balance sheet . Figure 7.6 shows how these budgets relate ."
38,Which is not a section of the cash budget?,"The estimated sales information is used to prepare the cash collections schedule , and the direct materials budget is used to prepare the cash payment schedule .  The cash receipts and cash payments budget are combined with the direct labor budget , the manufacturing overhead budget , the sales and administrative budget , and the capital assets budget to develop the cash budget .  Finally , all the information is used to flow to the budgeted balance sheet . Because the cash budget accounts for every inflow and outflow of cash , it is broken down into smaller components . The cash collections schedule includes all of the cash inflow expected to be received from customer sales , whether those customers pay at the same rate or even if they pay at all .  The cash collections schedule includes all the cash expected to be received and does not include the amount of the receivables estimated as uncollectible .  The cash payments schedule plans the outflow or payments of all accounts payable , showing when cash will be used to pay for direct material purchases . Both the cash collections schedule and the cash payments schedule are included along with other cash transactions in a cash budget . The cash budget , then , combines the cash collection schedule , the cash payment schedule , and all other budgets that plan for the inflow or outflow of cash . When everything is combined into one budget , that budget shows if financing arrangements are needed to maintain balances or if excess cash is available to pay for additional liabilities or assets ."
38,Which budget is the starting point in preparing financial budgets?," A budgeted income statement is formatted similarly to a traditional income statement except that it contains budgeted data .   Once all of the operating budgets have been created , these costs are used to prepare a budgeted income statement and budgeted balance sheet .  The manufacturing costs are allocated to the cost of goods sold and the ending inventory ."
38,Which of the following includes only financial budgets?," Preparing a financial budget first requires preparing the capital asset budget , the cash budgets , and the budgeted balance sheet .   The capital asset budget represents a significant investment in cash , and the amount is carried to the cash budget .   Therefore , it needs to be prepared before the cash budget .  If the cash will not be available , the capital asset budget can be adjusted and , again , carried to the cash budget .  A financial budget consists of the cash budget , the budgeted balance sheet , and the budget for capital expenses .  Similar to the individual budgets that make up the operating budgets , the financial budgets serve to assist with planning and monitoring the financing requirements of the organization . Management plans its capital asset needs and states them in the capital expense budget . Management addresses its collection and payment policies to determine when it will receive cash from sales and when it will pay the material , labor , and overhead expenses . The capital expense budget and the estimated payment and collection of cash allow management to build a cash budget and determine when it will need financing or have additional funds to pay back loans . These budgets taken together will be part of the budgeted balance sheet . Figure 7.6 shows how these budgets relate ."
38,Which budget evaluates the results of operations at the actual level of activity?," A flexible budget is one based on different volumes of sales .   A flexible budget flexes the static budget for each anticipated level of production .   This flexibility allows management to estimate what the budgeted numbers would look like at various levels of sales .   Flexible budgets are prepared at each analysis period ( usually monthly ) , rather than in advance , since the idea is to compare the operating income to the expenses deemed appropriate at the actual production level . "
38,What is the main difference between static and flexible budgets?," A static budget is one that is prepared based on a single level of output for a given period .   The master budget , and all the budgets included in the master budget , are examples of static budgets .   Actual results are compared to the static budget numbers as one means to evaluate company performance .   However , this comparison may be like comparing apples to oranges because variable costs should follow production , which should follow sales .  Thus , if sales differ from what is budgeted , then comparing actual costs to budgeted costs may not provide a clear indicator of how well the company is meeting its targets . A flexible budget created each period allows for a comparison of apples to apples because it will calculate budgeted costs based on the actual sales activity ."
39,Negative effects of stress are most likely to be experienced when an event is perceived as ________.,"If a person appraises an event as harmful and believes that the demands imposed by the event exceed the available resources to manage or adapt to it , the person will subjectively experience a state of stress .  In contrast , if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening , she is unlikely to experience stress .  According to this definition , environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they are interpreted and the meanings they are assigned . In short , stress is largely in the eye of the beholder : it ’ s not so much what happens to you as it is how you respond ( Selye , 1976 ) ."
39,"Between 2006 and 2009, the greatest increases in stress levels were found to occur among ________.","Figure 14.6 depicts the results of three national surveys in which several thousand individuals from different demographic groups completed a brief stress questionnaire ; the surveys were administered in 1983 , 2006 , and 2009 ( Cohen & Janicki-Deverts , 2012 ) . All three surveys demonstrated higher stress in women than in men . Unemployed individuals reported high levels of stress in all three surveys , as did those with less education and income ; retired persons reported the lowest stress levels .  However , from 2006 to 2009 the greatest increase in stress levels occurred among men , Whites , people aged 45 – 64 , college graduates , and those with full-time employment .  One interpretation of these findings is that concerns surrounding the 2008 – 2009 economic downturn ( e . g . , threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of retirement savings ) may have been especially stressful to White , college-educated , employed men with limited time remaining in their working careers ."
39,At which stage of Selye’s general adaptation syndrome is a person especially vulnerable to illness?," If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time , the stage of exhaustion ensues .  At this stage , the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor : the body ’ s ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body ’ s tissues and organs .  As a result , illness , disease , and other permanent damage to the body — even death — may occur .  If a missing child still remained missing after three months , the long-term stress associated with this situation may cause a parent to literally faint with exhaustion at some point or even to develop a serious and irreversible illness ."
39,"During an encounter judged as stressful, cortisol is released by the ________.","In short bursts , this process can have some favorable effects , such as providing extra energy , improving immune system functioning temporarily , and decreasing pain sensitivity . However , extended release of cortisol — as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress — often comes at a high price . High levels of cortisol have been shown to produce a number of harmful effects . For example , increases in cortisol can significantly weaken our immune system ( Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser , 2005 ) , and high levels are frequently observed among depressed individuals ( Geoffroy , Hertzman , Li , & Power , 2013 ) .  In summary , a stressful event causes a variety of physiological reactions that activate the adrenal glands , which in turn release epinephrine , norepinephrine , and cortisol .  These hormones affect a number of bodily processes in ways that prepare the stressed person to take direct action , but also in ways that may heighten the potential for illness . What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress ? The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex , but they generally involve the work of two systems — the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis .  When a person first perceives something as stressful ( Selye ’ s alarm reaction ) , the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands .  Release of these hormones activates the fight-or-flight responses to stress , such as accelerated heart rate and respiration . At the same time , the HPA axis , which is primarily endocrine in nature , becomes especially active , although it works much more slowly than the sympathetic nervous system . In response to stress , the hypothalamus ( one of the limbic structures in the brain ) releases corticotrophin-releasing factor , a hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) ( Figure 14.11 ) . The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream ; an important one is cortisol , which can affect virtually every organ within the body .  Cortisol is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor , preparing us to run away or fight .  However , sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system ."
39,"According to the Holmes and Rahe scale, which life event requires the greatest amount of readjustment?"," In developing their scale , Holmes and Rahe asked 394 participants to provide a numerical estimate for each of the 43 items ; each estimate corresponded to how much readjustment participants felt each event would require .  These estimates resulted in mean value scores for each event — often called life change units ( LCUs ) ( Rahe , McKeen , & Arthur , 1967 ) . The numerical scores ranged from 11 to 100 , representing the perceived magnitude of life change each event entails .  Death of a spouse ranked highest on the scale with 100 LCUs , and divorce ranked second highest with 73 LCUs .  In addition , personal injury or illness , marriage , and job termination also ranked highly on the scale with 53 , 50 , and 47 LCUs , respectively . Conversely , change in residence ( 20 LCUs ) , change in eating habits ( 15 LCUs ) , and vacation ( 13 LCUs ) ranked low on the scale ( Table 14.1 ) . Minor violations of the law ranked the lowest with 11 LCUs . To complete the scale , participants checked yes for events experienced within the last 12 months . LCUs for each checked item are totaled for a score quantifying the amount of life change . Agreement on the amount of adjustment required by the various life events on the SRRS is highly consistent , even cross-culturally ( Holmes & Masuda , 1974 ) ."
39,What is one of the major criticisms of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale?," The Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) provides researchers a simple , easy-to-administer way of assessing the amount of stress in people ’ s lives , and it has been used in hundreds of studies ( Thoits , 2010 ) .  Despite its widespread use , the scale has been subject to criticism . First , many of the items on the SRRS are vague ; for example , death of a close friend could involve the death of a long-absent childhood friend that requires little social readjustment ( Dohrenwend , 2006 ) . In addition , some have challenged its assumption that undesirable life events are no more stressful than desirable ones ( Derogatis & Coons , 1993 ) . However , most of the available evidence suggests that , at least as far as mental health is concerned , undesirable or negative events are more strongly associated with poor outcomes ( such as depression ) than are desirable , positive events ( Hatch & Dohrenwend , 2007 ) .  Perhaps the most serious criticism is that the scale does not take into consideration respondents ’ appraisals of the life events it contains .  As you recall , appraisal of a stressor is a key element in the conceptualization and overall experience of stress . Being fired from work may be devastating to some but a welcome opportunity to obtain a better job for others . The SRRS remains one of the most well-known instruments in the study of stress , and it is a useful tool for identifying potential stress-related health outcomes ( Scully et al . , 2000 ) ."
39,Which of the following is not a dimension of job burnout?,"Some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout , which is a general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one ’ s job ( Maslach & Jackson , 1981 ) . Job burnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs ( e . g . , social workers , teachers , therapists , and police officers ) . Job burnout consists of three dimensions .  The first dimension is exhaustion — a sense that one ’ s emotional resources are drained or that one is at the end of her rope and has nothing more to give at a psychological level .   Second , job burnout is characterized by depersonalization : a sense of emotional detachment between the worker and the recipients of his services , often resulting in callous , cynical , or indifferent attitudes toward these individuals .   Third , job burnout is characterized by diminished personal accomplishment , which is the tendency to evaluate one ’ s work negatively by , for example , experiencing dissatisfaction with one ’ s job-related accomplishments or feeling as though one has categorically failed to influence others ’ lives through one ’ s work . "
39,The white blood cells that attack foreign invaders to the body are called ________.,"When evaluating these findings , it is important to remember that there is a tangible physiological connection between the brain and the immune system . For example , the sympathetic nervous system innervates immune organs such as the thymus , bone marrow , spleen , and even lymph nodes ( Maier , Watkins , & Fleshner , 1994 ) . Also , we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis activation can adversely impact immune function .  One way they do this is by inhibiting the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells that circulate in the body ’ s fluids that are important in the immune response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) . "
39,The risk of heart disease is especially high among individuals with ________.," It is important to point out that depression may be just one piece of the emotional puzzle in elevating the risk for heart disease , and that chronically experiencing several negative emotional states may be especially important .  A longitudinal investigation of Vietnam War veterans found that depression , anxiety , hostility , and trait anger each independently predicted the onset of heart disease ( Boyle , Michalek , & Suarez , 2006 ) . However , when each of these negative psychological attributes was combined into a single variable , this new variable ( which researchers called psychological risk factor ) predicted heart disease more strongly than any of the individual variables . Thus , rather than examining the predictive power of isolated psychological risk factors , it seems crucial for future researchers to examine the effects of combined and more general negative emotional and psychological traits in the development of cardiovascular illnesses .  The American Heart Association , fully aware of the established importance of depression in cardiovascular diseases , several years ago recommended routine depression screening for all heart disease patients ( Lichtman et al . , 2008 ) .  Recently , they have recommended including depression as a risk factor for heart disease patients ( AHA , 2014 ) .  Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg ( 1937 ) , who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia ( an archaic term for depression ) was six times higher than that of the population .  A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over 8,000 manic-depressive persons in Denmark , finding a nearly 50 % increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general Danish population ( Weeke , 1979 ) .  By the early 1990s , evidence began to accumulate showing that depressed individuals who were followed for long periods of time were at increased risk for heart disease and cardiac death ( Glassman , 2007 ) .  In one investigation of over 700 Denmark residents , those with the highest depression scores were 71 % more likely to have experienced a heart attack than were those with lower depression scores ( Barefoot & Schroll , 1996 ) . Figure 14.20 illustrates the gradation in risk of heart attacks for both men and women ."
39,The most lethal dimension of Type A behavior pattern seems to be ________.," Extensive research clearly suggests that the anger / hostility dimension of Type A behavior pattern may be one of the most important factors in the development of heart disease .   This relationship was initially described in the Haynes et al .   ( 1980 ) study mentioned above : Suppressed hostility was found to substantially elevate the risk of heart disease for both men and women .  Also , one investigation followed over 1,000 male medical students from 32 to 48 years . At the beginning of the study , these men completed a questionnaire assessing how they react to pressure ; some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger , whereas others indicated that they respond with less anger . Decades later , researchers found that those who earlier had indicated the highest levels of anger were over 6 times more likely than those who indicated less anger to have had a heart attack by age 55 , and they were 3.5 times more likely to have experienced heart disease by the same age ( Chang , Ford , Meoni , Wang , & Klag , 2002 ) . From a health standpoint , it clearly does not pay to be an angry young person ."
39,Which of the following statements pertaining to asthma is false?,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , around 4,000 people die each year from asthma-related causes , and asthma is a contributing factor to another 7,000 deaths each year ( CDC , 2013a ) . The CDC has revealed that asthma affects 18.7 million U . S . adults and is more common among people with lower education and income levels ( CDC , 2013b ) .  Especially concerning is that asthma is on the rise , with rates of asthma increasing 157 % between 2000 and 2010 ( CDC , 2013b ) . "
39,Emotion-focused coping would likely be a better method than problem-focused coping for dealing with which of the following stressors?," While many stressors elicit both kinds of coping strategies , problem-focused coping is more likely to occur when encountering stressors we perceive as controllable , while emotion-focused coping is more likely to predominate when faced with stressors that we believe we are powerless to change ( Folkman & Lazarus , 1980 ) .  Clearly , emotion-focused coping is more effective in dealing with uncontrollable stressors . For example , if at midnight you are stressing over a 40 - page paper due in the morning that you have not yet started , you are probably better off recognizing the hopelessness of the situation and doing something to take your mind off it ; taking a problem-focused approach by trying to accomplish this task would only lead to frustration , anxiety , and even more stress ."
39,The concept of learned helplessness was formulated by Seligman to explain the ________.,"Dig Deeper Learned Helplessness When we lack a sense of control over the events in our lives , particularly when those events are threatening , harmful , or noxious , the psychological consequences can be profound .  In one of the better illustrations of this concept , psychologist Martin Seligman conducted a series of classic experiments in the 1960s ( Seligman & Maier , 1967 ) in which dogs were placed in a chamber where they received electric shocks from which they could not escape .   Later , when these dogs were given the opportunity to escape the shocks by jumping across a partition , most failed to even try ; they seemed to just give up and passively accept any shocks the experimenters chose to administer .   In comparison , dogs who were previously allowed to escape the shocks tended to jump the partition and escape the pain ( Figure 14.22 ) . "
39,Which of the following is not one of the presumed components of happiness?," Some psychologists have suggested that happiness consists of three distinct elements : the pleasant life , the good life , and the meaningful life , as shown in Figure 14.25 ( Seligman , 2002 ; Seligman , Steen , Park , & Peterson , 2005 ) .   The pleasant life is realized through the attainment of day-to-day pleasures that add fun , joy , and excitement to our lives .  For example , evening walks along the beach and a fulfilling sex life can enhance our daily pleasure and contribute to the pleasant life .  The good life is achieved through identifying our unique skills and abilities and engaging these talents to enrich our lives ; those who achieve the good life often find themselves absorbed in their work or their recreational pursuits .  The meaningful life involves a deep sense of fulfillment that comes from using our talents in the service of the greater good : in ways that benefit the lives of others or that make the world a better place . In general , the happiest people tend to be those who pursue the full life — they orient their pursuits toward all three elements ( Seligman et al . , 2005 ) ."
39,Researchers have identified a number of factors that are related to happiness. Which of the following is not one of them?,"So we ’ ve identified many factors that exhibit some correlation to happiness . What factors don ’ t show a correlation ?  Researchers have studied both parenthood and physical attractiveness as potential contributors to happiness , but no link has been identified .  Although people tend to believe that parenthood is central to a meaningful and fulﬁlling life , aggregate findings from a range of countries indicate that people who do not have children are generally happier than those who do ( Hansen , 2012 ) . And although one ’ s perceived level of attractiveness seems to predict happiness , a person ’ s objective physical attractiveness is only weakly correlated with her happiness ( Diener , Wolsic , & Fujita , 1995 ) ."
39,How does positive affect differ from optimism?,"Although positive affect and optimism are related in some ways , they are not the same ( Pressman & Cohen , 2005 ) .  Whereas positive affect is mostly concerned with positive feeling states , optimism has been regarded as a generalized tendency to expect that good things will happen ( Chang , 2001 ) .  It has also been conceptualized as a tendency to view life ’ s stressors and difficulties as temporary and external to oneself ( Peterson & Steen , 2002 ) . Numerous studies over the years have consistently shown that optimism is linked to longevity , healthier behaviors , fewer postsurgical complications , better immune functioning among men with prostate cancer , and better treatment adherence ( Rasmussen & Wallio , 2008 ) . Further , optimistic people report fewer physical symptoms , less pain , better physical functioning , and are less likely to be rehospitalized following heart surgery ( Rasmussen , Scheier , & Greenhouse , 2009 ) ."
40,The study of nutrient cycling though the environment is an example of which of the following?,"The Karner blue butterflies and the wild lupine live in an oak-pine barren habitat . This habitat is characterized by natural disturbance and nutrient-poor soils that are low in nitrogen . The availability of nutrients is an important factor in the distribution of the plants that live in this habitat .  Researchers interested in ecosystem ecology could ask questions about the importance of limited resources and the movement of resources , such as nutrients , though the biotic and abiotic portions of the ecosystem .   Ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal , population , and community ecology .  The ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components ( living things ) in an area along with the abiotic components ( non-living things ) of that area . Some of the abiotic components include air , water , and soil .  Ecosystem biologists ask questions about how nutrients and energy are stored and how they move among organisms and the surrounding atmosphere , soil , and water . "
40,Understory plants in a temperate forest have adaptations to capture limited ________.,"Energy from the sun is captured by green plants , algae , cyanobacteria , and photosynthetic protists . These organisms convert solar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things . Light availability can be an important force directly affecting the evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers .  For instance , plants in the understory of a temperate forest are shaded when the trees above them in the canopy completely leaf out in the late spring .   Not surprisingly , understory plants have adaptations to successfully capture available light .  One such adaptation is the rapid growth of spring ephemeral plants such as the spring beauty ( Figure 44.8 ) . These spring flowers achieve much of their growth and finish their life cycle ( reproduce ) early in the season before the trees in the canopy develop leaves ."
40,Which of the following biomes is characterized by abundant water resources?," Tropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in these areas are ideal for plant growth .  Therefore , the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant communities with very high species diversities ( Figure 44.13 ) . Tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any other biome ; on average between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare ( 2.5 acres ) of South America . One way to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome . On the forest floor is a sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter . Above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage . A layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopy — the uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves . Some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy . These layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants , fungi , animals , and other organisms within the tropical wet forests . For instance , epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants , which typically are not harmed . Epiphytes are found throughout tropical wet forest biomes . Many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet forests for food and shelter . Some organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle . The temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes , with the temperatures ranging from 20 ° C to 34 ° C ( 68 ° F to 93 ° F ) . When one compares the annual temperature variation of tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes , the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest becomes apparent . This lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth , rather than the seasonal ( spring , summer , and fall ) growth seen in other biomes . In contrast to other ecosystems , tropical ecosystems do not have long days and short days during the yearly cycle . Instead , a constant daily amount of sunlight ( 11 – 12 hrs per day ) provides more solar radiation , thereby , a longer period of time for plant growth . The annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 to 660 cm ( 50 – 200 in ) with some monthly variation . While sunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent , annual rainfall is highly variable .  Tropical wet forests have wet months in which there can be more than 30 cm ( 11 – 12 in ) of precipitation , as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10 cm ( 3.5 in ) of rainfall .   However , the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds the annual rainfall of some other biomes , such as deserts . "
40,Which of the following biomes is characterized by short growing seasons?,"The Arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the Arctic regions of the northern hemisphere ( Figure 44.12 ) . The average winter temperature is - 34 ° C ( - 34 ° F ) and the average summer temperature is from 3 ° C to 12 ° C ( 37 ° F – 52 ° F ) .  Plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 10 – 12 weeks .  However , during this time , there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid . The annual precipitation of the Arctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation . And , as in the boreal forests , there is little evaporation due to the cold temperatures . Plants in the Arctic tundra are generally low to the ground ( Figure 44.20 ) . There is little species diversity , low net primary productivity , and low aboveground biomass . The soils of the Arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost . The permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter , which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter . During the growing season , the ground of the Arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens ."
40,A key feature of estuaries is:," Estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water , such as a river , meets the ocean .   Therefore , both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity ; mixing results in a diluted ( brackish ) saltwater .  Estuaries form protected areas where many of the young offspring of crustaceans , mollusks , and fish begin their lives . Salinity is a very important factor that influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries . The salinity of estuaries varies and is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources . Once or twice a day , high tides bring salt water into the estuary . Low tides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water . The ocean is the largest marine biome . It is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical composition ; it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter . Within the ocean , coral reefs are a second kind of marine biome .  Estuaries , coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix , form a third unique marine biome . "
40,Which of the following natural forces is responsible for the release of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gases?,"Finally , volcanic eruptions are a third natural driver of climate change .  Volcanic eruptions can last a few days , but the solids and gases released during an eruption can influence the climate over a period of a few years , causing short-term climate changes .   The gases and solids released by volcanic eruptions can include carbon dioxide , water vapor , sulfur dioxide , hydrogen sulfide , hydrogen , and carbon monoxide .  Generally , volcanic eruptions cool the climate . This occurred in 1783 when volcanos in Iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide . This led to haze-effect cooling , a global phenomenon that occurs when dust , ash , or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result ; haze-effect cooling usually extends for one or more years . In Europe and North America , haze-effect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784 ."
41,"That a business may only report activities on financial statements that are specifically related to company operations, not those activities that affect the owner personally, is known as which of the following?"," The separate entity concept prescribes that a business may only report activities on financial statements that are specifically related to company operations , not those activities that affect the owner personally .  This concept is called the separate entity concept because the business is considered an entity separate and apart from its owner ( s ) ."
41,"That companies can present useful information in shorter time periods such as years, quarters, or months is known as which of the following?","A potential or existing investor wants timely i nformation by which to measure the performance of the company , and to help decide whether to invest .  Because of the time period assumption , we need to be sure to recognize revenues and expenses in the proper period .  This might mean allocating costs over more than one accounting or reporting period .  The time period assumption states that a company can present useful information in shorter time periods , such as years , quarters , or months .  The information is broken into time frames to make comparisons and evaluations easier . The information will be timely and current and will give a meaningful picture of how the company is operating ."
41,"The system of using a monetary unit, such as the US dollar, to value the transaction is known as which of the following?"," In order to record a transaction , we need a system of monetary measurement , or a monetary unit by which to value the transaction .  In the United States , this monetary unit is the US dollar . Without a dollar amount , it would be impossible to record information in the financial records . It also would leave stakeholders unable to make financial decisions , because there is no comparability measurement between companies . This concept ignores any change in the purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation ."
41,Which of the following terms is used when assuming a business will continue to operate in the foreseeable future?," The going concern assumption assumes a business will continue to operate in the foreseeable future .  A common time frame might be twelve months . However , one should presume the business is doing well enough to continue operations unless there is evidence to the contrary . For example , a business might have certain expenses that are paid off ( or reduced ) over several time periods . If the business will stay operational in the foreseeable future , the company can continue to recognize these long-term expenses over several time periods . Some red flags that a business may no longer be a going concern are defaults on loans or a sequence of losses ."
41,"The standards, procedures, and principles companies must follow when preparing their financial statements are known as which of the following?"," In Introduction to Financial Statements , you learned that the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) is an independent , nonprofit organization that sets the standards for financial accounting and reporting , including generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) , for both public - and private-sector businesses in the United States . "
41,"These are used by the FASB, and it is a set of concepts that guide financial reporting.","As you learned in Role of Accounting in Society , US-based companies will apply US GAAP as created by the FASB , and most international companies will apply IFRS as created by the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) .  As illustrated in this chapter , the starting point for either FASB or IASB in creating accounting standards , or principles , is the conceptual framework .  Both FASB and IASB cover the same topics in their frameworks , and the two frameworks are similar . The conceptual framework helps in the standard-setting process by creating the foundation on which those standards should be based . It can also help companies figure out how to record transactions for which there may not currently be an applicable standard . Though there are many similarities between the conceptual framework under US GAAP and IFRS , these similar foundations result in different standards and / or different interpretations .  The FASB uses a conceptual framework , which is a set of concepts that guide financial reporting .  These concepts can help ensure information is comparable and reliable to stakeholders . Guidance may be given on how to report transactions , measurement requirements , and application on financial statements , among other things . 3 3 Financial Accounting Standards Board . “ The Conceptual Framework . ” http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/BridgePage&cid=1176168367774"
41,"This is the independent federal agency protecting the interests of investors, regulating stock markets, and ensuring companies adhere to GAAP requirements."," You also learned that the SEC is an independent federal agency that is charged with protecting the interests of investors , regulating stock markets , and ensuring companies adhere to GAAP requirements .  By having proper accounting standards such as US GAAP or IFRS , information presented publicly is considered comparable and reliable . As a result , financial statement users are more informed when making decisions . The SEC not only enforces the accounting rules but also delegates the process of setting standards for US GAAP to the FASB ."
41,Which of the following is the principle that a business must report any business activities that could affect what is reported on the financial statements?," The full disclosure principle states that a business must report any business activities that could affect what is reported on the financial statements .  These activities could be nonfinancial in nature or be supplemental details not readily available on the main financial statement . Some examples of this include any pending litigation , acquisition information , methods used to calculate certain figures , or stock options . These disclosures are usually recorded in footnotes on the statements , or in addenda to the statements ."
41,"Also known as the historical cost principle, ________ states that everything the company owns or controls (assets) must be recorded at their value at the date of acquisition."," The cost principle states that you must record an asset on the books for the price you bought it for and then leave it on the books at that value unless there is a specific rule to the contrary .  The company purchased the building for $ 175,000 . It must stay on the books at $ 175,000 . Companies are not allowed to increase the value of an asset on their books just because they believe it is worth more .  The cost principle , also known as the historical cost principle , states that virtually everything the company owns or controls ( assets ) must be recorded at its value at the date of acquisition .  For most assets , this value is easy to determine as it is the price agreed to when buying the asset from the vendor . There are some exceptions to this rule , but always apply the cost principle unless FASB has specifically stated that a different valuation method should be used in a given circumstance ."
41,Which of the following principles matches expenses with associated revenues in the period in which the revenues were generated?, The expense recognition principle ( also referred to as the matching principle ) states that we must match expenses with associated revenues in the period in which the revenues were earned .  A mismatch in expenses and revenues could be an understated net income in one period with an overstated net income in another period . There would be no reliability in statements if expenses were recorded separately from the revenues generated .
41,Which of the following does not accurately represent the accounting equation?," As you have learned , the accounting equation represents the idea that a company needs assets to operate , and there are two major sources that contribute to operations : liabilities and equity .   The company borrows the funds , creating liabilities , or the company can take the funds provided by the profits generated in the current or past periods , creating retained earnings or some other form of stockholder ’ s equity .  Recall the accounting equation ’ s basic form ."
41,Which of these statements is false ?," Remember that the accounting equation must remain balanced , and assets need to equal liabilities plus equity .  On the asset side of the equation , we show an increase of $ 20,000 . On the liabilities and equity side of the equation , there is also an increase of $ 20,000 , keeping the equation balanced . Changes to assets , specifically cash , will increase assets on the balance sheet and increase cash on the statement of cash flows . Changes to stockholder ’ s equity , specifically common stock , will increase stockholder ’ s equity on the balance sheet ."
41,Which of these accounts is an asset?," The company purchased supplies , which are assets to the business until used .  Supplies is increasing , because the company has more supplies than it did before . Supplies is an asset that is increasing on the debit side ."
41,Which of these accounts is a liability?,"Printing Plus did not pay immediately for the supplies and asked to be billed for the supplies , payable at a later date .  This creates a liability for the company , Accounts Payable .  This liability increases Accounts Payable ; thus , Accounts Payable increases on the credit side .  Accounts Payable recognized the liability the company had to the supplier to pay for the equipment .  Since the company is now paying off the debt it owes , this will decrease Accounts Payable . Liabilities decrease on the debit side ; therefore , Accounts Payable will decrease on the debit side by $ 3,500 ."
41,Which process of the accounting cycle often requires the most analytical thought?," If a trial balance is in balance , does this mean that all of the numbers are correct ?   Not necessarily .   We can have errors and still be mathematically in balance .   It is important to go through each step very carefully and recheck your work often to avoid mistakes early on in the process .  Once all the monthly transactions have been analyzed , journalized , and posted on a continuous day-to-day basis over the accounting period ( a month in our example ) , we are ready to start working on preparing a trial balance ( unadjusted ) .  Preparing an unadjusted trial balance is the fourth step in the accounting cycle .  A trial balance is a list of all accounts in the general ledger that have nonzero balances .  A trial balance is an important step in the accounting process , because it helps identify any computational errors throughout the first three steps in the cycle . "
41,The step-by-step process to record business activities and events to keep financial records up to date is ________.,"This chapter on analyzing and recording transactions is the first of three consecutive chapters ( including The Adjustment Process and Completing the Accounting Cycle ) covering the steps in one continuous process known as the accounting cycle .  The accounting cycle is a step-by-step process to record business activities and events to keep financial records up to date .  The process occurs over one accounting period and will begin the cycle again in the following period . A period is one operating cycle of a business , which could be a month , quarter , or year . Review the accounting cycle in Figure 3.5 ."
41,"One operating cycle of a business, which could be a month, quarter, or year, is commonly referred to as which of the following?","This chapter on analyzing and recording transactions is the first of three consecutive chapters ( including The Adjustment Process and Completing the Accounting Cycle ) covering the steps in one continuous process known as the accounting cycle .

The process occurs over one accounting period and will begin the cycle again in the following period .  A period is one operating cycle of a business , which could be a month , quarter , or year .  Review the accounting cycle in Figure 3.5 ."
41,________ takes all transactions from the journal during a period and moves the information to a general ledger (ledger).,"Step 3 . The third step in the process is posting journal information to a ledger .  Posting takes all transactions from the journal during a period and moves the information to a general ledger , or ledger .  As you ’ ve learned , account balances can be represented visually in the form of T-accounts ."
41,Which of these events will not be recognized?," There also does not have to be a correlation between when cash is collected and when revenue is recognized .   A customer may not pay for the service on the day it was provided .  Even though the customer has not yet paid cash , there is a reasonable expectation that the customer will pay in the future .  Since the company has provided the service , it would recognize the revenue as earned , even though cash has yet to be collected . "
41,What is the impact on the accounting equation when a current month’s utility expense is paid?,"Paying a utility bill creates an expense for the company .  Utility Expense increases , and does so on the debit side of the accounting equation . "
41,What is the impact on the accounting equation when a payment of account payable is made?," Accounts Payable recognized the liability the company had to the supplier to pay for the equipment .   Since the company is now paying off the debt it owes , this will decrease Accounts Payable .   Liabilities decrease on the debit side ; therefore , Accounts Payable will decrease on the debit side by $ 3,500 . "
41,What is the impact on the accounting equation when an accounts receivable is collected?,"The customer did not immediately pay for the services and owes Printing Plus payment . This money will be received in the future , increasing Accounts Receivable .  Accounts Receivable is an asset account .   Asset accounts increase on the debit side .  Therefore , Accounts Receivable will increase for $ 5,500 on the debit side ."
41,What is the impact on the accounting equation when a sale occurs?,"Distribution of earnings to ownership is called a dividend . The dividend could be paid with cash or be a distribution of more company stock to current shareholders . Either way , dividends will decrease retained earnings . Dividends are considered a contra equity account . An account is a contra account if its normal balance is opposite of the normal balance of the category to which it belongs . The normal balance for the equity category is a credit balance whereas the normal balance for dividends is a debit balance resulting in dividends reducing total equity . Also affecting retained earnings are revenues and expenses , by way of net income or net loss .  Revenues are earnings from the sale of goods and services .   An increase in revenues will also contribute toward an increase in retained earnings .  Expenses are the cost of resources associated with earning revenues . An increase to expenses will contribute toward a decrease in retained earnings . Recall that this concept of recognizing expenses associated with revenues is the expense recognition principle . Some examples of expenses include bill payments for utilities , employee salaries , and loan interest expense . A business does not have an expense until it is “ incurred . ” Incurred means the resource is used or consumed . For example , you will not recognize utilities as an expense until you have used the utilities . The difference between revenues earned and expenses incurred is called net income ( loss ) and can be found on the income statement ."
41,"What is the impact on the accounting equation when stock is issued, in exchange for assets?","When the company issues stock , stockholders purchase common stock , yielding a higher common stock figure than before issuance .  The common stock account is increasing and affects equity .   Looking at the expanded accounting equation , we see that Common Stock increases on the credit side .  Analysis : Looking at the accounting equation , we know cash is an asset and common stock is stockholder ’ s equity . When a company collects cash , this will increase assets because cash is coming into the business .  When a company issues common stock , this will increase a stockholder ’ s equity because he or she is receiving investments from owners . "
41,Which of the following accounts is increased by a debit?,"The company purchased supplies , which are assets to the business until used . Supplies is increasing , because the company has more supplies than it did before .  Supplies is an asset that is increasing on the debit side . "
41,Which of the following accounts does not increase with a debit entry?,"Advertising is an expense of doing business . You have incurred more expenses , so you want to increase an expense account .  Expense accounts increase with debit entries .  Debit advertising expense . Net income reported on the income statement flows into the statement of retained earnings .  If a business has net income ( earnings ) for the period , then this will increase its retained earnings for the period .  This means that revenues exceeded expenses for the period , thus increasing retained earnings . If a business has net loss for the period , this decreases retained earnings for the period . This means that the expenses exceeded the revenues for the period , thus decreasing retained earnings ."
41,Which of the following pairs increase with credit entries?,"You have mowed lawns and earned more revenue . You want the total of your revenue account to increase to reflect this additional revenue .  Revenue accounts increase with credit entries , so credit lawn-mowing revenue . "
41,Which of the following accounts will normally have a debit balance?,"The company purchased supplies , which are assets to the business until used . Supplies is increasing , because the company has more supplies than it did before .  Supplies is an asset that is increasing on the debit side . "
41,What type of account is prepaid insurance?," Prepaid expenses are items paid for in advance of their use .   They are considered assets until used .  Some examples can include insurance and rent . Insurance , for example , is usually purchased for more than one month at a time ( six months typically ) . The company does not use all six months of the insurance at once , it uses it one month at a time . However , the company prepays for all of it up front . As each month passes , the company will adjust its records to reflect the cost of one month of insurance usage ."
41,Unearned service revenue occurs when which of the following occurs?, The revenue recognition principle directs a company to recognize revenue in the period in which it is earned ; revenue is not considered earned until a product or service has been provided .  This means the period of time in which you performed the service or gave the customer the product is the period in which revenue is recognized .
41,Which of these transactions requires a debit entry to Cash?," You have received more cash from customers , so you want the total cash to increase .   Cash is an asset , and assets increase with debit entries , so debit cash . "
41,Which of these transactions requires a credit entry to Revenue?,"Printing Plus provided the services , which means the company can recognize revenue as earned in the Service Revenue account .  Service Revenue increases equity ; therefore , Service Revenue increases on the credit side . "
41,Which of the following accounting records is the main source of information used to prepare the financial statements?," In The Adjustment Process we review steps 5 , 6 , and 7 in the accounting cycle : record adjusting entries , prepare an adjusted trial balance , and prepare financial statements .  In Completing the Accounting Cycle , we review steps 8 and 9 : closing entries and prepare a post-closing trial balance . As stated previously , we do not cover reversing entries ."
42,Which of the following is NOT a way the normal microbiota of the intestine helps to prevent infection?," The constant movement of materials through the gastrointestinal tract also helps to move transient pathogens out of the body .  In fact , feces are composed of approximately 25 % microbes , 25 % sloughed epithelial cells , 25 % mucus , and 25 % digested or undigested food .  Finally , the normal microbiota provides an additional barrier to infection via a variety of mechanisms .   For example , these organisms outcompete potential pathogens for space and nutrients within the intestine .  This is known as competitive exclusion . Members of the microbiota may also secrete protein toxins known as bacteriocins that are able to bind to specific receptors on the surface of susceptible bacteria . The environment of most of the GI tract is harsh , which serves two purposes : digestion and immunity .  The stomach is an extremely acidic environment ( pH 1.5 – 3.5 ) due to the gastric juices that break down food and kill many ingested microbes ; this helps prevent infection from pathogens .  The environment in the small intestine is less harsh and is able to support microbial communities . Microorganisms present in the small intestine can include lactobacilli , diptherioids and the fungus Candida . On the other hand , the large intestine ( colon ) contains a diverse and abundant microbiota that is important for normal function . These microbes include Bacteriodetes ( especially the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella ) and Firmicutes ( especially members of the genus Clostridium ) . Methanogenic archaea and some fungi are also present , among many other species of bacteria .  These microbes all aid in digestion and contribute to the production of feces , the waste excreted from the digestive tract , and flatus , the gas produced from microbial fermentation of undigested food .  They can also produce valuable nutrients . For example , lactic acid bacteria such as bifidobacteria can synthesize vitamins , such as vitamin B12 , folate , and riboflavin , that humans cannot synthesize themselves . E . coli found in the intestine can also break down food and help the body produce vitamin K , which is important for blood coagulation ."

E . coli found in the intestine can also break down food and help the body produce vitamin K , which is important for blood coagulation .  The digestive system contains normal microbiota , including archaea , bacteria , fungi , protists , and even viruses .  Because this microbiota is important for normal functioning of the digestive system , alterations to the microbiota by antibiotics or diet can be harmful . Additionally , the introduction of pathogens to the GI tract can cause infections and diseases . In this section , we will review the microbiota found in a healthy digestive tract and the general signs and symptoms associated with oral and GI infections ."
42,What pathogen is the most important contributor to biofilms in plaque?,"Additionally , poor oral health can contribute to the development of disease . Increased bacterial growth in the mouth can cause inflammation and infection in other parts of the body .  For example , Streptococcus in the mouth , the main contributor to biofilms on teeth , tartar , and dental caries , can spread throughout the body when there is damage to the tissues inside the mouth , as can happen during dental work .  S . mutans produces a surface adhesin known as P1 , which binds to salivary agglutinin on the surface of the tooth . P1 can also bind to extracellular matrix proteins including fibronectin and collagen . When Streptococcus enters the bloodstream as a result of tooth brushing or dental cleaning , it causes inflammation that can lead to the accumulation of plaque in the arteries and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis , a condition associated with cardiovascular disease , heart attack , and stroke . In some cases , bacteria that spread through the blood vessels can lodge in the heart and cause endocarditis ( an example of a focal infection ) . Tooth decay results from the metabolic activity of microbes that live on the teeth . A layer of proteins and carbohydrates forms when clean teeth come into contact with saliva . Microbes are attracted to this food source and form a biofilm called plaque .  The most important cariogenic species in these biofilms is Streptococcus mutans .  When sucrose , a disaccharide sugar from food , is broken down by bacteria in the mouth , glucose and fructose are produced . The glucose is used to make dextran , which is part of the extracellular matrix of the biofilm . Fructose is fermented , producing organic acids such as lactic acid . These acids dissolve the minerals of the tooth , including enamel , even though it is the hardest material in the body . The acids work even more quickly on exposed dentin ( Figure 24.7 ) . Over time , the plaque biofilm can become thick and eventually calcify . When a heavy plaque deposit becomes hardened in this way , it is called tartar or dental calculus ( Figure 24.8 ) . These substantial plaque biofilms can include a variety of bacterial species , including Streptococcus and Actinomyces species ."
42,What type of organism causes thrush?," The yeast Candida is part of the normal human microbiota , but overgrowths , especially of Candida albicans , can lead to infections in several parts of the body .   When Candida infection develops in the oral cavity , it is called oral thrush .  Oral thrush is most common in infants because they do not yet have well developed immune systems and have not acquired the robust normal microbiota that keeps Candida in check in adults . Oral thrush is also common in immunodeficient patients and is a common infection in patients with AIDS . The environment of most of the GI tract is harsh , which serves two purposes : digestion and immunity . The stomach is an extremely acidic environment ( pH 1.5 – 3.5 ) due to the gastric juices that break down food and kill many ingested microbes ; this helps prevent infection from pathogens . The environment in the small intestine is less harsh and is able to support microbial communities .

42,"In mumps, what glands swell to produce the disease’s characteristic appearance?"," The viral disease mumps is an infection of the parotid glands , the largest of the three pairs of salivary glands ( Figure 24.3 ) .  The causative agent is mumps virus ( MuV ) , a paramyxovirus with an envelope that has hemagglutinin and neuraminidase spikes . A fusion protein located on the surface of the envelope helps to fuse the viral envelope to the host cell plasma membrane ."
42,Which of the following is true of HSV-1?," As described in Viral Infections of the Skin and Eyes , infections by herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) frequently manifest as oral herpes , also called acute herpes labialis and characterized by cold sores on the lips , mouth , or gums .   HSV - 1 can also cause acute herpetic gingivostomatitis , a condition that results in ulcers of the mucous membranes inside the mouth ( Figure 24.12 ) .   Herpetic gingivostomatitis is normally self-limiting except in immunocompromised patients .  Like oral herpes , the infection is generally diagnosed through clinical examination , but cultures or biopsies may be obtained if other signs or symptoms suggest the possibility of a different causative agent . If treatment is needed , mouthwashes or antiviral medications such as acyclovir , famciclovir , or valacyclovir may be used ."
42,Which type of E. coli infection can be severe with life-threatening consequences such as hemolytic uremic syndrome?," EHEC can cause disease ranging from relatively mild to life-threatening .   Symptoms include bloody diarrhea with severe cramping , but no fever .   Although it is often self-limiting , it can lead to hemorrhagic colitis and profuse bleeding .  One possible complication is HUS . Diagnosis involves culture , often using MacConkey with sorbitol agar to differentiate between E . coli O157 : H7 , which does not ferment sorbitol , and other less virulent strains of E . coli that can ferment sorbitol ."
42,Which species of Shigella has a type that produces Shiga toxin?," S . dysenteriae type 1 is able to produce Shiga toxin , which targets the endothelial cells of small blood vessels in the small and large intestine by binding to a glycosphingolipid .  Once inside the endothelial cells , the toxin targets the large ribosomal subunit , thus affecting protein synthesis of these cells . Hemorrhaging and lesions in the colon can result . The toxin can target the kidney ’ s glomerulus , the blood vessels where filtration of blood in the kidney begins , thus resulting in HUS ."
42,Which type of bacterium produces an A-B toxin?," Because V . cholerae is killed by stomach acid , relatively large doses are needed for a few microbial cells to survive to reach the intestines and cause infection .   The motile cells travel through the mucous layer of the intestines , where they attach to epithelial cells and release cholera enterotoxin .   The toxin is an A-B toxin with activity through adenylate cyclase ( see Virulence Factors of Bacterial and Viral Pathogens ) .  Within the intestinal cell , cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels increase , which activates a chloride channel and results in the release of ions into the intestinal lumen . This increase in osmotic pressure in the lumen leads to water also entering the lumen . As the water and electrolytes leave the body , it causes rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance . Diarrhea is so profuse that it is often called “ rice water stool , ” and patients are placed on cots with a hole in them to monitor the fluid loss ( Figure 24.19 ) ."
42,Which form of hepatitisvirus can only infect an individual who is already infected with another hepatitisvirus?," HDV is uncommon in the United States and only occurs in individuals who are already infected with HBV , which it requires for replication .  Therefore , vaccination against HBV is also protective against HDV infection . HDV is transmitted through contact with infected blood ."
42,Which cause of viral gastroenteritis commonly causes projectile vomiting?," The signs and symptoms of norovirus infection are similar to those for rotavirus , with watery diarrhea , mild cramps , and fever .   Additionally , these viruses sometimes cause projectile vomiting .  The illness is usually relatively mild , develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure , and clears within a couple of days without treatment . However , dehydration may occur ."
42,Which protozoan is associated with the ability to cause severe dysentery?," The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebiasis , which is known as amoebic dysentery in severe cases .   E . histolytica is generally transmitted through water or food that has fecal contamination .  The disease is most widespread in the developing world and is one of the leading causes of mortality from parasitic disease worldwide . Disease can be caused by as few as 10 cysts being transmitted ."
42,"Which protozoan has a unique appearance, with a blue halo, when viewed using ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy?"," Microscopic examination is used for diagnosis .  A stool O & P examination may be helpful .  The oocysts have a distinctive blue halo when viewed using ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 24.30 ) .   The intestinal disease cyclosporiasis is caused by the protozoan Cyclospora cayetanensis .  It is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions and therefore uncommon in the United States , although there have been outbreaks associated with contaminated produce imported from regions where the protozoan is more common ."
42,"The micrograph shows protozoans attached to the intestinal wall of a gerbil. Based on what you know about protozoan intestinal parasites, what is it?"," This protist is transmitted through contaminated food and water and reaches the lining of the small intestine , where it causes infection .  Signs and symptoms begin within seven to ten days after ingestion . Based on limited data , it appears to be seasonal in ways that differ regionally and that are poorly understood . 19 19 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . “ Cyclosporiasis FAQs for Health Professionals . ” Updated June 13 , 2014 . http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/health_professionals/hp-faqs.html .  The intestinal disease cyclosporiasis is caused by the protozoan Cyclospora cayetanensis .  It is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions and therefore uncommon in the United States , although there have been outbreaks associated with contaminated produce imported from regions where the protozoan is more common . Signs and symptoms range from nonexistent to mild diarrhea to severe amoebic dysentery . Severe infection causes the abdomen to become distended and may be associated with fever .  The parasite may live in the colon without causing signs or symptoms or may invade the mucosa to cause colitis .  In some cases , the disease spreads to the spleen , brain , genitourinary tract , or lungs . In particular , it may spread to the liver and cause an abscess . When a liver abscess develops , fever , nausea , liver tenderness , weight loss , and pain in the right abdominal quadrant may occur . Chronic infection may occur and is associated with intermittent diarrhea , mucus , pain , flatulence , and weight loss .  The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebiasis , which is known as amoebic dysentery in severe cases .  E . histolytica is generally transmitted through water or food that has fecal contamination . The disease is most widespread in the developing world and is one of the leading causes of mortality from parasitic disease worldwide . Disease can be caused by as few as 10 cysts being transmitted .  Another protozoan intestinal illness is cryptosporidiosis , which is usually caused by Cryptosporidium parvum or C . hominis .  ( Figure 24.29 ) These pathogens are commonly found in animals and can be spread in feces from mice , birds , and farm animals . Contaminated water and food are most commonly responsible for transmission . The protozoan can also be transmitted through human contact with infected animals or their feces .  Also called backpacker ’ s diarrhea or beaver fever , giardiasis is a common disease in the United States caused by the flagellated protist Giardia lamblia , also known as Giardia intestinalis or Giardia duodenalis ( Figure 1.16 ) .   To establish infection , G . lamblia uses a large adhesive disk to attach to the intestinal mucosa .  The disk is comprised of microtubules . During adhesion , the flagella of G . lamblia move in a manner that draws fluid out from under the disk , resulting in an area of lower pressure that promotes its adhesion to the intestinal epithelial cells . Due to its attachment , Giardia also blocks absorption of nutrients , including fats ."
42,What is another name for Trichuris trichiura?," The nematode whipworm Trichuris trichiura is a parasite that is transmitted by ingestion from soil-contaminated hands or food and causes trichuriasis .  Infection is most common in warm environments , especially when there is poor sanitation and greater risk of fecal contamination of soil , or when food is grown in soil using manure as a fertilizer . The signs and symptoms may be minimal or nonexistent . When a substantial infection develops , signs and symptoms include painful , frequent diarrhea that may contain mucus and blood . It is possible for the infection to cause rectal prolapse , a condition in which a portion of the rectum becomes detached from the inside of the body and protrudes from the anus ( Figure 24.35 ) . Severely infected children may experience reduced growth and their cognitive development may be affected ."
42,Which type of helminth infection can be diagnosed using tape?," Infection is diagnosed in any of three ways .   First , because the worms emerge at night to lay eggs , it is possible to inspect the perianal region for worms while an individual is asleep .   An alternative is to use transparent tape to remove eggs from the area around the anus first thing in the morning for three days to yield eggs for microscopic examination .  Finally , it may be possible to detect eggs through examination of samples from under the fingernails , where eggs may lodge due to scratching . Once diagnosis has been made , mebendazole , albendazole , and pyrantel pamoate are effective for treatment .  Pinworms ( Enterobiasis ) "
43,Which of the following does not represent a group that participated significantly in westward migration after 1870?," In addition to a significant European migration westward , several thousand African Americans migrated west following the Civil War , as much to escape the racism and violence of the Old South as to find new economic opportunities .   They were known as exodusters , referencing the biblical flight from Egypt , because they fled the racism of the South , with most of them headed to Kansas from Kentucky , Tennessee , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas .  Over twenty-five thousand exodusters arrived in Kansas in 1879 – 1880 alone . By 1890 , over 500,000 Blacks lived west of the Mississippi River . Although the majority of Black migrants became farmers , approximately twelve thousand worked as cowboys during the Texas cattle drives . Some also became “ Buffalo Soldiers ” in the wars against Native Americans . “ Buffalo Soldiers ” were African Americans allegedly so-named by various Native tribes who equated their black , curly hair with that of the buffalo . Many had served in the Union army in the Civil War and were now organized into six , all-Black cavalry and infantry units whose primary duties were to protect settlers from Native American attacks during the westward migration , as well as to assist in building the infrastructure required to support western settlement ( Figure 17.5 ) . Nearly 400,000 settlers had made the trek westward by the height of the movement in 1870 . The vast majority were men , although families also migrated , despite incredible hardships for women with young children .  More recent immigrants also migrated west , with the largest numbers coming from Northern Europe and Canada .   Germans , Scandinavians , and Irish were among the most common .  These ethnic groups tended to settle close together , creating strong rural communities that mirrored the way of life they had left behind . According to U . S . Census Bureau records , the number of Scandinavians living in the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century exploded , from barely 18,000 in 1850 to over 1.1 million in 1900 . During that same time period , the German-born population in the United States grew from 584,000 to nearly 2.7 million and the Irish-born population grew from 961,000 to 1.6 million . As they moved westward , several thousand immigrants established homesteads in the Midwest , primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin , where , as of 1900 , over one-third of the population was foreign-born , and in North Dakota , whose immigrant population stood at 45 percent at the turn of the century . Compared to European immigrants , those from China were much less numerous , but still significant .  More than 200,000 Chinese arrived in California between 1876 and 1890 , albeit for entirely different reasons related to the Gold Rush . "
43,Which of the following represents an action that the U.S. government took to help Americans fulfill the goal of western expansion?," The Homestead Act allowed any head of household , or individual over the age of twenty-one — including unmarried women — to receive a parcel of 160 acres for only a nominal filing fee .  All that recipients were required to do in exchange was to “ improve the land ” within a period of five years of taking possession . The standards for improvement were minimal : Owners could clear a few acres , build small houses or barns , or maintain livestock .  Under this act , the government transferred over 270 million acres of public domain land to private citizens .   To assist the settlers in their move westward and transform the migration from a trickle into a steady flow , Congress passed two significant pieces of legislation in 1862 : the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Act .  Born largely out of President Abraham Lincoln ’ s growing concern that a potential Union defeat in the early stages of the Civil War might result in the expansion of slavery westward , Lincoln hoped that such laws would encourage the expansion of a “ free soil ” mentality across the West ."
43,What specific types of hardships did an average American farmer not face as he built his homestead in the Midwest?," The first houses built by western settlers were typically made of mud and sod with thatch roofs , as there was little timber for building .   Rain , when it arrived , presented constant problems for these sod houses , with mud falling into food , and vermin , most notably lice , scampering across bedding ( Figure 17.8 ) .   Weather patterns not only left the fields dry , they also brought tornadoes , droughts , blizzards , and insect swarms .   Tales of swarms of locusts were commonplace , and the crop-eating insects would at times cover the ground six to twelve inches deep .  One frequently quoted Kansas newspaper reported a locust swarm in 1878 during which the insects devoured “ everything green , stripping the foliage off the bark and from the tender twigs of the fruit trees , destroying every plant that is good for food or pleasant to the eye , that man has planted . ”"
43,Which of the following groups was not impacted by the invention of barbed wire?,"Americana Barbed Wire and a Way of Life Gone Called the “ devil ’ s rope ” by Native Americans , barbed wire had a profound impact on the American West . Before its invention , settlers and ranchers alike were stymied by a lack of building materials to fence off land . Communal grazing and long cattle drives were the norm . But with the invention of barbed wire , large cattle ranchers and their investors were able to cheaply and easily parcel off the land they wanted — whether or not it was legally theirs to contain . As with many other inventions , several people “ invented ” barbed wire around the same time . In 1873 , it was Joseph Glidden , however , who claimed the winning design and patented it .  Not only did it spell the end of the free range for settlers and cowboys , it kept more land away from Native tribes , who had never envisioned a culture that would claim to own land ( Figure 17.11 ) .  Life as a cowboy was dirty and decidedly unglamorous . The terrain was difficult ; conflicts with Native Americans , especially in Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) , were notoriously deadly . But the longhorn cattle were hardy stock , and could survive and thrive while grazing along the long trail , so cowboys braved the trip for the promise of steady employment and satisfying wages . Eventually , however , the era of the free range ended .  Ranchers developed the land , limiting grazing opportunities along the trail , and in 1873 , the new technology of barbed wire allowed ranchers to fence off their lands and cattle claims .  With the end of the free range , the cattle industry , like the mining industry before it , grew increasingly dominated by eastern businessmen . Capital investors from the East expanded rail lines and invested in ranches , ending the reign of the cattle drives ."
43,The American cowboy owes much of its model to what other culture?,"Between 1865 and 1885 , as many as forty thousand cowboys roamed the Great Plains , hoping to work for local ranchers . They were all men , typically in their twenties , and close to one-third of them were Hispanic or African American .  It is worth noting that the stereotype of the American cowboy — and indeed the cowboys themselves — borrowed much from the Mexicans who had long ago settled those lands .  The saddles , lassos , chaps , and lariats that define cowboy culture all arose from the Mexican ranchers who had used them to great effect before the cowboys arrived ."
43,Which of the following was not a primary method by which the American government dealt with American Indians during the period of western settlement?," Beginning in the 1880s , clergymen , government officials , and social workers all worked to assimilate Native peoples into American life .  The government permitted reformers to remove Native American children from their homes and place them in boarding schools , such as the Carlisle Indian School or the Hampton Institute , where they were taught to abandon their tribal traditions and embrace the tools of American productivity , modesty , and sanctity through total immersion . Such schools not only acculturated Native American boys and girls , but also provided vocational training for males and domestic science classes for females . Adults were also targeted by religious reformers , specifically evangelical Protestants as well as a number of Catholics , who sought to convince Native people to abandon their language , clothing , and social customs for a more Euro-American lifestyle ( Figure 17.14 ) . Despite their success at Little Bighorn , neither the Sioux nor any other Plains tribe followed this battle with any other armed encounter .  Rather , they either returned to tribal life or fled out of fear of remaining troops , until the U . S . Army arrived in greater numbers and began to exterminate Indian encampments and force others to accept payment for forcible removal from their lands .  Sitting Bull himself fled to Canada , although he later returned in 1881 and subsequently worked in Buffalo Bill ’ s Wild West show . In Montana , the Blackfoot and Crow were forced to leave their tribal lands . In Colorado , the Utes gave up their lands after a brief period of resistance . In Idaho , most of the Nez Perce gave up their lands peacefully , although in an incredible episode , a band of some eight hundred Indians sought to evade U . S . troops and escape into Canada . Back east , the popular vision of the West was of a vast and empty land . But of course this was an exaggerated depiction . On the eve of westward expansion , as many as 250,000 Native Americans , representing a variety of tribes , populated the Great Plains . Previous wars against these tribes in the early nineteenth century , as well as the failure of earlier treaties , had led to a general policy of the forcible removal of many tribes in the eastern United States .  The Indian Removal Act of 1830 resulted in the infamous “ Trail of Tears , ” which saw nearly fifty thousand Seminole , Choctaw , Chickasaw , and Creek people relocated west of the Mississippi River to what is now Oklahoma between 1831 and 1838 .  Building upon such a history , the U . S . government was prepared , during the era of western settlement , to deal with tribes that settlers viewed as obstacles to expansion ."
43,What did the Last Arrow pageant symbolize?,"A vital part of the assimilation effort was land reform . During earlier negotiations , the government had respected that the Native tribes used their land communally . Most Native American belief structures did not allow for the concept of individual land ownership ; rather , land was available for all to use , and required responsibility from all to protect it . As a part of their plan to Americanize the tribes , reformers sought legislation to replace this concept with the popular Euro-American notion of real estate ownership and self-reliance . One such law was the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 , named after a reformer and senator from Massachusetts , which struck a deadly blow to the Native American way of life . In what was essentially a new version of the original Homestead Act , the Dawes Act permitted the federal government to divide the lands of any tribe and grant 160 acres of farmland or 320 acres of grazing land to each head of family , with lesser amounts to single persons and others . In a nod towards the paternal relationship with which Whites viewed Native Americans — similar to the justification of the previous treatment of enslaved African Americans — the Dawes Act permitted the federal government to hold an individual Native American ’ s newly acquired land in trust for twenty-five years . Only then would they obtain full title and be granted the citizenship rights that land ownership entailed . It would not be until 1924 that formal citizenship was granted to all Native Americans . Under the Dawes Act , Native Americans were given the most arid , useless land . Further , inefficiencies and corruption in the government meant that much of the land due to be allotted to Native Americans was simply deemed “ surplus ” and claimed by settlers . Once all allotments were determined , the remaining tribal lands — as much as eighty million acres — were sold to White American settlers .  The final element of “ Americanization ” was the symbolic “ last arrow ” pageant , which often coincided with the formal redistribution of tribal lands under the Dawes Act .  At these events , Native Americans were forced to assemble in their tribal garb , carrying a bow and arrow . They would then symbolically fire their “ last arrow ” into the air , enter a tent where they would strip away their traditional clothing , dress in a White farmer ’ s coveralls , and emerge to take a plow and an American flag to show that they had converted to a new way of life . It was a seismic shift for the Native Americans , and one that left them bereft of their culture and history . 17.5 The Impact of Expansion on Chinese Immigrants and Hispanic Citizens Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
43,What brought the majority of Chinese immigrants to the U.S.?,"The initial arrival of Chinese immigrants to the United States began as a slow trickle in the 1820s , with barely 650 living in the U . S . by the end of 1849 .  However , as gold rush fever swept the country , Chinese immigrants , too , were attracted to the notion of quick fortunes .   By 1852 , over 25,000 Chinese immigrants had arrived , and by 1880 , over 300,000 Chinese lived in the United States , most in California .  While they had dreams of finding gold , many instead found employment building the first transcontinental railroad ( Figure 17.15 ) . Some even traveled as far east as the former cotton plantations of the Old South , which they helped to farm after the Civil War . Several thousand of these immigrants booked their passage to the United States using a “ credit-ticket , ” in which their passage was paid in advance by American businessmen to whom the immigrants were then indebted for a period of work . Most arrivals were men : Few wives or children ever traveled to the United States . As late as 1890 , less than 5 percent of the Chinese population in the U . S . was female . Regardless of gender , few Chinese immigrants intended to stay permanently in the United States , although many were reluctantly forced to do so , as they lacked the financial resources to return home ."
43,How were Hispanic citizens deprived of their wealth and land in the course of western settlement?,"In a few instances , frustrated Hispanic citizens fought back against the White settlers who dispossessed them of their belongings .  In 1889 – 1890 in New Mexico , several hundred Mexican Americans formed las Gorras Blancas ( the White Caps ) to try and reclaim their land and intimidate White Americans , preventing further land seizures .  White Caps conducted raids of White farms , burning homes , barns , and crops to express their growing anger and frustration . However , their actions never resulted in any fundamental changes . Several White Caps were captured , beaten , and imprisoned , whereas others eventually gave up , fearing harsh reprisals against their families . Some White Caps adopted a more political strategy , gaining election to local offices throughout New Mexico in the early 1890s , but growing concerns over the potential impact upon the territory ’ s quest for statehood led several citizens to heighten their repression of the movement . Other laws passed in the United States intended to deprive Mexican Americans of their heritage as much as their lands . “ Sunday Laws ” prohibited “ noisy amusements ” such as bullfights , cockfights , and other cultural gatherings common to Hispanic communities at the time . “ Greaser Laws ” permitted the imprisonment of any unemployed Mexican American on charges of vagrancy . Although Hispanic Americans held tightly to their cultural heritage as their remaining form of self-identity , such laws did take a toll . In California and throughout the Southwest , the massive influx of Anglo-American settlers simply overran the Hispanic populations that had been living and thriving there , sometimes for generations . Despite being U . S . citizens with full rights , Hispanics quickly found themselves outnumbered , outvoted , and , ultimately , outcast . Corrupt state and local governments favored Whites in land disputes , and mining companies and cattle barons discriminated against them , as with the Chinese workers , in terms of pay and working conditions . In growing urban areas such as Los Angeles , barrios , or clusters of working-class homes , grew more isolated from the White American centers . Hispanic Americans , like the Native Americans and Chinese , suffered the fallout of the White settlers ’ relentless push west ."
44,The crime of larceny includes:,"Larceny and embezzlement are two forms of theft that can occur within a business .  Larceny occurs when a person unlawfully takes the personal property of another person or a business .  For example , if an employee takes another employee ’ s computer with the intent of stealing it , he or she may be guilty of larceny . In contrast , embezzlement occurs when a person has been entrusted with an item of value and then refuses to return it or does not return the item . For example , if an employee is entrusted with the petty cash at his or her office and that person purposefully takes some of the money for himself or herself , this would be embezzlement ."
44,Businesses can be charged with crimes.," Businesses can be charged with criminal acts as well .  In 2017 , Oliver Schmidt , former manager of a Volkswagen engineering office near Detroit , was arrested . He faced years in prison for attempts to defraud the United States , wire fraud , violation of the Clean Air Act , and a charge of giving an untrue statement under the Clean Air Act . Schmidt ’ s actions directly violated a business law and , since his actions violated an established law , he was held criminally liable . In December of 2017 , Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison . It is important to know that not all people charged with business crimes or white collar crimes are necessarily guilty .  A person must be found guilty of the crime before he or she is convicted .   Regardless , business crimes and white collar crimes negatively impact the individual , the organization he or she worked for , the community , and customers .  5.2 Civil vs . Criminal Liability"
44,The burden of proof is a criminal case is:,"Typically , there is a difference in the burden of proof for the two types of cases .  In a criminal case , the defendant must be proven guilty “ beyond a reasonable doubt . ” In a civil case , the defendant must be proven liable through a “ preponderance of the evidence . ” In other words , the prosecution in a civil case must prove that it is more probable than not that the defendant is liable .  Then , there will be discovery and trial .  In criminal cases , the jury will convict only if convinced “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” that the defendant committed the crime , and the verdict must be unanimous .  This type of case involves a higher burden of proof than in civil cases ."
44,Which of the following is a goal of an arraignment?," The next stage is called the arraignment , where the defendant appears in court so that the court can determine or confirm his or her identity , inform the defendant of the charge the prosecutor has filed against him or her , and hear the defendant ’ s plea . "
44,The criminal act necessary to commit a crime is known as:,"There are usually two components to criminal conduct that must be proven by the prosecutor .  The prosecutor prosecutes the case against the accused : mens rea ( the criminal , or guilty , or “ wrongful ” mind ) and actus reus ( the criminal , or guilty , or “ wrongful ” act ) . "
45,Where does perception occur?,"Vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images . Animals are bombarded with sensory information , and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic . Fortunately , the visual systems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli .  The importance of vision to humans is further substantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual information .  Light"
45,"If a person’s cold receptors no longer convert cold stimuli into sensory signals, that person has a problem with the process of ________.","Senses provide information about the body and its environment . Humans have five special senses : olfaction ( smell ) , gustation ( taste ) , equilibrium ( balance and body position ) , vision , and hearing . Additionally , we possess general senses , also called somatosensation , which respond to stimuli like temperature , pain , pressure , and vibration . Vestibular sensation , which is an organism ’ s sense of spatial orientation and balance , proprioception ( position of bones , joints , and muscles ) , and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia ( limb movement ) are part of somatosensation .  Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different , all share a common function : to convert a stimulus ( such as light , or sound , or the position of the body ) into an electrical signal in the nervous system .  This process is called sensory transduction . There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction . In one , a neuron works with a sensory receptor , a cell , or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus . Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron , which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system . In the second type of sensory transduction , a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment : this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor . Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli , thus showing little receptor specificity . For example , pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature changes , chemical stimulation , or pressure ."
45,"After somatosensory transduction, the sensory signal travels through the brain as a(n) _____ signal."," The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system .  This takes place at the sensory receptor , and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential . How is sensory input , such as pressure on the skin , changed to a receptor potential ? In this example , a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor ( as shown in Figure 36.2 ) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure . Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron , changing its electrical potential . Recall that in the nervous system , a positive change of a neuron ’ s electrical potential ( also called the membrane potential ) , depolarizes the neuron . Receptor potentials are graded potentials : the magnitude of these graded ( receptor ) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus . If the magnitude of depolarization is sufficient ( that is , if membrane potential reaches a threshold ) , the neuron will fire an action potential . In most cases , the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction , although for some receptors , such as those in the visual system , this is not always the case .

45,"_____ are found only in _____ skin, and detect skin deflection.","Sensory receptors are classified into five categories : mechanoreceptors , thermoreceptors , proprioceptors , pain receptors , and chemoreceptors .

45,Which of the following has the fewest taste receptors?,"Detecting a taste ( gustation ) is fairly similar to detecting an odor ( olfaction ) , given that both taste and smell rely on chemical receptors being stimulated by certain molecules . The primary organ of taste is the taste bud . A taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors ( taste cells ) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae ( singular : papilla ) ( illustrated in Figure 36.10 ) . There are several structurally distinct papillae .  Filiform papillae , which are located across the tongue , are tactile , providing friction that helps the tongue move substances , and contain no taste cells .  In contrast , fungiform papillae , which are located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue , each contain one to eight taste buds and also have receptors for pressure and temperature . The large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a V near the posterior margin of the tongue . In addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillae — leaf-like papillae located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue , as seen in the Figure 36.10 micrograph . Foliate papillae contain about 1,300 taste buds within their folds . Finally , there are circumvallate papillae , which are wall-like papillae in the shape of an inverted “ V ” at the back of the tongue . Each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds . Each taste bud ’ s taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days . These are elongated cells with hair-like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore ( illustrate in Figure 36.11 ) . Food molecules ( tastants ) are dissolved in saliva , and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli . The receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue , outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent ."
45,How many different taste molecules do taste cells each detect?," In humans , there are five primary tastes , and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor .  Thus , like olfaction , each receptor is specific to its stimulus ( tastant ) . Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect the molecular composition of the tastant . A salty tastant ( containing NaCl ) provides the sodium ions ( Na + ) that enter the taste neurons and excite them directly . Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family . Binding of an acid or other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion ( H + ) concentrations in the taste neurons , thus depolarizing them . Sweet , bitter , and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled receptor . These tastants bind to their respective receptors , thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them ."

45,All sensory signals except _____ travel to the _____ in the brain before the cerebral cortex.,"Once in the brain , visual information is processed in several places , and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of visual information to humans and other animals .  One route takes the signals to the thalamus , which serves as the routing station for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction .  In the thalamus , the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions remain intact , and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each . When visual signals leave the thalamus , they travel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain . From the visual cortex , the visual signals travel in two directions . One stream that projects to the parietal lobe , in the side of the brain , carries magnocellular ( “ where ” ) information . A second stream projects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular ( “ where ” ) and parvocellular ( “ what ” ) information .  All sensory signals , except those from the olfactory system , are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex .  Recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves as a clearinghouse and relay station for sensory ( as well as motor ) signals . When the sensory signal exits the thalamus , it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex ( Figure 36.3 ) dedicated to processing that particular sense ."
45,"In sound, pitch is measured in _____, and volume is measured in _____.","As is true for all waves , there are four main characteristics of a sound wave : frequency , wavelength , period , and amplitude . Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time , and in sound is heard as pitch . High-frequency ( ≥ 15.000 Hz ) sounds are higher-pitched ( short wavelength ) than low-frequency ( long wavelengths ; ≤ 100Hz ) sounds .  Frequency is measured in cycles per second , and for sound , the most commonly used unit is hertz ( Hz ) , or cycles per second .  Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz . Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies , but everyone ’ s ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age . Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz ; cats , 60,000 Hz ; bats , 100,000 Hz ; and dolphins 150,000 Hz , and American shad ( Alosa sapidissima ) , a fish , can hear 180,000 Hz . Those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound . Amplitude , or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough , in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in Figure 36.12 . The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds .  For sound , volume is measured in decibels ( dB ) .  The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point . Humans speak normally at 60 decibels ."
45,Auditory hair cells are indirectly anchored to the _____.,"The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti ( spiral organ ) .  It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil , with their exposed short , hair-like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them .  The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row , numbering approximately 3,500 . The stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membrane ’ s lower surface . The outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows . They number approximately 12,000 , and they function to fine tune incoming sound waves . The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane . All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors , and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel ( refer to Figure 36.2 ) . As a result , the hair cell membrane is depolarized , and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve . Intensity ( volume ) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated . The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way . The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions , according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it . Likewise , the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a specific frequency of sound waves . Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies , but they require stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range . The difference in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent . Compare that to adjacent piano strings , which are about six percent different . Place theory , which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear , states that high frequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port ( the oval window ) . Lower frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane . The basic pitch-determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated . The place theory is the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception . Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear , it is thought that there must be some auditory “ sharpening ” mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution ."
45,Which of the following are found both in the auditory system and the vestibular system?," The vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system .   It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system , but it excites them in different ways .  There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear : the utricle , the saccule , and three semicircular canals . Together , they make up what ’ s known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in Figure 36.15 . The utricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line , such as gravity . The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle and 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer , with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin . Embedded in this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystals — like tiny rocks . When the head is tilted , the crystals continue to be pulled straight down by gravity , but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift , thereby bending the stereocilia . The bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons , and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted , allowing the maintenance of balance . It is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance ."
45,Why do people over 55 often need reading glasses?,"The main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis . The lens is dynamic , focusing and re-focusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field . The lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken , changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina .  With age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens , and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results .  Presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina . Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short . For both defects , images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry . Myopia ( nearsightedness ) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina . In this case , images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear ."
45,"Why is it easier to see images at night using peripheral, rather than the central, vision?","The fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision . The fovea has a high density of cones . When you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light , the eyes orient so that the object ’ s image falls on the fovea .  However , when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light , the object can be better viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina , rather than the cones at the center , that operate better in low light .  In humans , cones far outnumber rods in the fovea . There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina : rods and cones , named for their general appearance as illustrated in Figure 36.18 . Rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina .  They detect dim light and are used primarily for peripheral and nighttime vision .  Cones are weakly photosensitive and are located near the center of the retina .  They respond to bright light , and their primary role is in daytime , color vision . "
45,A person catching a ball must coordinate her head and eyes. What part of the brain is helping to do this?," Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain , where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information .  Finally , there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) of the hypothalamus . The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body ’ s internal clock , which controls our circadian ( day-long ) cycle . The SCN sends information to the pineal gland , which is important in sleep / wake patterns and annual cycles ."
46,"A(n) ________ is a sudden, permanent change in a sequence of DNA.","Sickle-cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes . For example , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful amino acids into harmless byproducts . If someone with this condition goes untreated , he or she will experience significant deficits in cognitive function , seizures , and increased risk of various psychiatric disorders . Because PKU is a recessive trait , each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order to produce a child with the condition ( Figure 3.6 ) . So far , we have discussed traits that involve just one gene , but few human characteristics are controlled by a single gene . Most traits are polygenic : controlled by more than one gene . Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from ? Gene mutations provide one source of harmful genes .  A mutation is a sudden , permanent change in a gene .  While many mutations can be harmful or lethal , once in a while , a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who do not have the mutation . Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations . In order for this process to occur , there must be competition — more technically , there must be variability in genes ( and resultant traits ) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment . If a population consisted of identical individuals , then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way , and there would be no variation in selection . In contrast , diversity in genes and associated traits allows some individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change . This creates a distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and genetic transmission ."
46,"________ refers to a person’s genetic makeup, while ________ refers to a person’s physical characteristics.","Genetic variation , the genetic difference between individuals , is what contributes to a species ’ adaptation to its environment . In humans , genetic variation begins with an egg , about 100 million sperm , and fertilization . Fertile women ovulate roughly once per month , releasing an egg from follicles in the ovary . During the egg's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes . Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs . In each chromosome , sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics , known as traits , such as eye color , hair color , and so on . A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles . An allele is a specific version of a gene . So , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has . When a sperm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes .  Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) .   A person ’ s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual .  Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’ s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( Figure 3.4 ) . Most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by one gene . A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent . In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b . ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele . When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele . When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous . For example , smooth chin is a recessive trait , which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele ( bb ) . Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin . What type of chin will their child have ? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries . If the woman is homozygous for cleft chin ( BB ) , her offspring will always have cleft chin . It gets a little more complicated , however , if the mother is heterozygous for this gene ( Bb ) . Since the father has a smooth chin — therefore homozygous for the recessive allele ( bb ) — we can expect the offspring to have a 50 % chance of having a cleft chin and a 50 % chance of having a smooth chin ( Figure 3.5 ) ."
46,________ is the field of study that focuses on genes and their expression.,"Genes do not exist in a vacuum . Although we are all biological organisms , we also exist in an environment that is incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves , but also in what combination . Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction . Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall . For example , if an individual ’ s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation . According to the concept of range of reaction , genes set definite limits on potential , and environment determines how much of that potential is achieved . Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person ’ s potential . Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic environmental correlation . Stated simply , our genes influence our environment , and our environment influences the expression of our genes ( Figure 3.7 ) . Not only do our genes and environment interact , as in range of reaction , but they also influence one another bidirectionally . For example , the child of an NBA player would probably be exposed to basketball from an early age . Such exposure might allow the child to realize his or her full genetic , athletic potential . Thus , the parents ’ genes , which the child shares , influence the child ’ s environment , and that environment , in turn , is well suited to support the child ’ s genetic potential .  In another approach to gene-environment interactions , the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways .   In other words , researchers study how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes .  As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious . For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings ) . But even with identical genes , there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin ’ s life . Sometimes , one twin will develop a disease and the other will not . In one example , Tiffany , an identical twin , died from cancer at age 7 , but her twin , now 19 years old , has never had cancer . Although these individuals share an identical genotype , their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is expressed over time . The epigenetic perspective is very different from range of reaction , because here the genotype is not fixed and limited . Link to Learning"

In each chromosome , sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics , known as traits , such as eye color , hair color , and so on . A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles . An allele is a specific version of a gene . So , a given gene may code for the trait of hair color , and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has .  When a sperm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes pair up and create a zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes .  Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) . A person ’ s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual . Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’ s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( Figure 3.4 ) . Most traits are controlled by multiple genes , but some traits are controlled by one gene . A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent . In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b . ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele . When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele . When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous . For example , smooth chin is a recessive trait , which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele ( bb ) . Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin . What type of chin will their child have ? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries . If the woman is homozygous for cleft chin ( BB ) , her offspring will always have cleft chin . It gets a little more complicated , however , if the mother is heterozygous for this gene ( Bb ) . Since the father has a smooth chin — therefore homozygous for the recessive allele ( bb ) — we can expect the offspring to have a 50 % chance of having a cleft chin and a 50 % chance of having a smooth chin ( Figure 3.5 ) ."
46,The ________ receive(s) incoming signals from other neurons.,"In healthy individuals , the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons , where synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synapse ( Figure 3.9 ) . The synapse is a very small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs .  Once neurotransmitters are released into the synapse , they travel across the small space and bind with corresponding receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron .  Receptors , proteins on the cell surface where neurotransmitters attach , vary in shape , with different shapes “ matching ” different neurotransmitters . The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma , or cell body . The soma has branching extensions known as dendrites .  The neuron is a small information processor , and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are received from other neurons .  These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon , which ends at multiple terminal buttons . The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemical messengers of the nervous system ."
46,A(n) ________ facilitates or mimics the activity of a given neurotransmitter system.," Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system .  Agonists are chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site and , thus , strengthen its effects . An antagonist , on the other hand , blocks or impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor . Agonist and antagonist drugs are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person ’ s condition . For example , Parkinson's disease , a progressive nervous system disorder , is associated with low levels of dopamine . Therefore dopamine agonists , which mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors , are one treatment strategy ."
46,Multiple sclerosis involves a breakdown of the ________.,"Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet . In some axons , glial cells form a fatty substance known as the myelin sheath , which coats the axon and acts as an insulator , increasing the speed at which the signal travels . The myelin sheath is crucial for the normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system : the loss of the insulation it provides can be detrimental to normal function . To understand how this works , let ’ s consider an example .  Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , an autoimmune disorder , involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout the nervous system .  The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms , such as dizziness , fatigue , loss of motor control , and sexual dysfunction . While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and manage certain symptoms , there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis ."
46,An action potential involves Na+ moving ________ the cell and K+ moving ________ the cell.,"Between signals , the neuron membrane ’ s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential . Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i . e . , a sodium-potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) . Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas , and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge .  In the resting state , sodium ( Na + ) is at higher concentrations outside the cell , so it will tend to move into the cell .   Potassium ( K + ) , on the other hand , is more concentrated inside the cell , and will tend to move out of the cell ( Figure 3.10 ) .  In addition , the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside . This provides an additional force on sodium , causing it to move into the cell . From this resting potential state , the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly ( Figure 3.11 ) . When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites — due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding to its receptors — small pores , or gates , open on the neuronal membrane , allowing Na + ions , propelled by both charge and concentration differences , to move into the cell . With this influx of positive ions , the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive . If that charge reaches a certain level , called the threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins . Many additional pores open , causing a massive influx of Na + ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential , the peak action potential . At the peak of the spike , the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open . As positively charged potassium ions leave , the cell quickly begins repolarization . At first , it hyperpolarizes , becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential , and then it levels off , returning to the resting potential . This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals . The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions . The action potential moves all the way down the axon to the terminal buttons ."
46,Our ability to make our legs move as we walk across the room is controlled by the ________ nervous system.," The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary .  It is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS ; therefore , it consists of motor neurons and sensory neurons . Motor neurons , carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles , are efferent fibers ( efferent means “ moving away from ” ) . Sensory neurons , carrying sensory information to the CNS , are afferent fibers ( afferent means “ moving toward ” ) . Each nerve is basically a two-way superhighway , containing thousands of axons , both efferent and afferent ."
46,"If your ________ is activated, you will feel relatively at ease."," Once the threat has been resolved , the parasympathetic nervous system takes over and returns bodily functions to a relaxed state .  Our hunter ’ s heart rate and blood pressure return to normal , his pupils constrict , he regains control of his bladder , and the liver begins to store glucose in the form of glycogen for future use . These processes are associated with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system . 3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to : The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be outside the realm of voluntary control . It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions ( Figure 3.14 ) .  The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related activities ; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine , day-to-day operations .  The two systems have complementary functions , operating in tandem to maintain the body ’ s homeostasis . Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium , in which biological conditions ( such as body temperature ) are maintained at optimal levels ."
46,The central nervous system is comprised of ________.,"The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions : the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) , shown in Figure 3.13 .  The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord ; the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body .  In this section , we focus on the peripheral nervous system ; later , we look at the brain and spinal cord ."
46,Sympathetic activation is associated with ________.,"The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations . The activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors , increasing their chances of survival . Imagine , for example , that one of our early ancestors , out hunting small game , suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs .  At that moment , his body undergoes a series of changes — a direct function of sympathetic activation — preparing him to face the threat .   His pupils dilate , his heart rate and blood pressure increase , his bladder relaxes , his liver releases glucose , and adrenaline surges into his bloodstream .  This constellation of physiological changes , known as the fight or flight response , allows the body access to energy reserves and heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety ."
46,"The ________ is a sensory relay station where all sensory information, except for smell, goes before being sent to other areas of the brain for further processing.","Other Areas of the Forebrain Other areas of the forebrain , located beneath the cerebral cortex , include the thalamus and the limbic system .  The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain .  All of our senses , with the exception of smell , are routed through the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing ( Figure 3.22 ) ."
46,"Damage to the ________ disrupts one’s ability to comprehend language, but it leaves one’s ability to produce words intact.","The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head ( temporal means “ near the temples ” ) , and is associated with hearing , memory , emotion , and some aspects of language . The auditory cortex , the main area responsible for processing auditory information , is located within the temporal lobe .  Wernicke ’ s area , important for speech comprehension , is also located here .  Whereas individuals with damage to Broca ’ s area have difficulty producing language , those with damage to Wernicke ’ s area can produce sensible language , but they are unable to understand it ( Figure 3.21 ) ."
46,A(n) ________ uses magnetic fields to create pictures of a given tissue.," In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , a person is placed inside a machine that generates a strong magnetic field .  The magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body ’ s cells to move . When the magnetic field is turned off , the hydrogen atoms emit electromagnetic signals as they return to their original positions . Tissues of different densities give off different signals , which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) operates on the same principles , but it shows changes in brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels . The fMRI provides more detailed images of the brain ’ s structure , as well as better accuracy in time , than is possible in PET scans ( Figure 3.28 ) . With their high level of detail , MRI and fMRI are often used to compare the brains of healthy individuals to the brains of individuals diagnosed with psychological disorders . This comparison helps determine what structural and functional differences exist between these populations ."
46,The two major hormones secreted from the pancreas are:,"The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response , such as epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) .  The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar levels : insulin and glucagon .  These pancreatic hormones are essential for maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels ( insulin ) or raising them ( glucagon ) . People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin ; therefore , they must take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production , and they must closely control the amount of sugars and carbohydrates they consume . The gonads secrete sexual hormones , which are important in reproduction , and mediate both sexual motivation and behavior . The female gonads are the ovaries ; the male gonads are the testes . Ovaries secrete estrogens and progesterone , and the testes secrete androgens , such as testosterone . Dig Deeper Athletes and Anabolic Steroids Although it is against Federal laws and many professional athletic associations ( The National Football League , for example ) have banned their use , anabolic steroid drugs continue to be used by amateur and professional athletes . The drugs are believed to enhance athletic performance . Anabolic steroid drugs mimic the effects of the body ’ s own steroid hormones , like testosterone and its derivatives . These drugs have the potential to provide a competitive edge by increasing muscle mass , strength , and endurance , although not all users may experience these results . Moreover , use of performance-enhancing drugs ( PEDs ) does not come without risks . Anabolic steroid use has been linked with a wide variety of potentially negative outcomes , ranging in severity from largely cosmetic ( acne ) to life threatening ( heart attack ) . Furthermore , use of these substances can result in profound changes in mood and can increase aggressive behavior ( National Institute on Drug Abuse , 2001 ) . Baseball player Alex Rodriguez ( A-Rod ) has been at the center of a media storm regarding his use of illegal PEDs . Rodriguez ’ s performance on the field was unparalleled while using the drugs ; his success played a large role in negotiating a contract that made him the highest paid player in professional baseball . Although Rodriguez maintains that he has not used PEDs for the several years , he received a substantial suspension in 2013 that , if upheld , will cost him more than 20 million dollars in earnings ( Gaines , 2013 ) . What are your thoughts on athletes and doping ? Why or why not should the use of PEDs be banned ? What advice would you give an athlete who was considering using PEDs ?"
46,The ________ secretes messenger hormones that direct the function of the rest of the endocrine glands.,"Major Glands The pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain , and acts in close association with it .  The pituitary is often referred to as the “ master gland ” because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system , although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus .  In addition to messenger hormones , the pituitary also secretes growth hormone , endorphins for pain relief , and a number of key hormones that regulate fluid levels in the body .  Hormones are involved in regulating all sorts of bodily functions , and they are ultimately controlled through interactions between the hypothalamus ( in the central nervous system ) and the pituitary gland ( in the endocrine system ) .  Imbalances in hormones are related to a number of disorders . This section explores some of the major glands that make up the endocrine system and the hormones secreted by these glands ."

46,The ________ secretes hormones that regulate the body’s fluid levels.,"Major Glands The pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain , and acts in close association with it . The pituitary is often referred to as the “ master gland ” because its messenger hormones control all the other glands in the endocrine system , although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus .  In addition to messenger hormones , the pituitary also secretes growth hormone , endorphins for pain relief , and a number of key hormones that regulate fluid levels in the body . "
47,The energy currency used by cells is ________.,"A living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy . Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell , which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell . Rather , a cell must be able to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed . Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .  ATP is often called the “ energy currency ” of the cell , and , like currency , this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell .  How ? It functions similarly to a rechargeable battery ."
47,A reducing chemical reaction ________.,"Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways . Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions . Oxidation and reduction occur in tandem .  An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound , and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction .  Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together , these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions , or redox reactions . Electrons and Energy"
47,"During the second half of glycolysis, what occurs?"," The last step in glycolysis will not occur if pyruvate kinase , the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate , is not available in sufficient quantities .   In this situation , the entire glycolysis pathway will proceed , but only two ATP molecules will be made in the second half .  Thus , pyruvate kinase is a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis . 7.3 Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to : So far , glycolysis has cost the cell two ATP molecules and produced two small , three-carbon sugar molecules .  Both of these molecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway , and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two ATP molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional ATP molecules and two even higher-energy NADH molecules . "
47,What is removed from pyruvate during its conversion into an acetyl group?,"The first reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase , a cytoplasmic enzyme , with a coenzyme of thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP , derived from vitamin B 1 and also called thiamine ) . A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvic acid , releasing carbon dioxide as a gas .  The loss of carbon dioxide reduces the size of the molecule by one carbon , making acetaldehyde .  The second reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize NADH to NAD + and reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol . The fermentation of pyruvic acid by yeast produces the ethanol found in alcoholic beverages . Ethanol tolerance of yeast is variable , ranging from about 5 percent to 21 percent , depending on the yeast strain and environmental conditions . Step 1 .  A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate , releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium .  The result of this step is a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme ( pyruvate dehydrogenase ) . This is the first of the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed . This step proceeds twice ( remember : there are two pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis ) for every molecule of glucose metabolized ; thus , two of the six carbons will have been removed at the end of both steps ."
47,What do the electrons added to NAD+ do?,"Here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway . The continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the oxidized form of the electron carrier , NAD + .  Thus , NADH must be continuously oxidized back into NAD + in order to keep this step going .   If NAD + is not available , the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops .   If oxygen is available in the system , the NADH will be oxidized readily , though indirectly , and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will be used to produce ATP .  In an environment without oxygen , an alternate pathway ( fermentation ) can provide the oxidation of NADH to NAD + . Step 6 .  The sixth step in glycolysis ( Figure 7.7 ) oxidizes the sugar ( glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate ) , extracting high-energy electrons , which are picked up by the electron carrier NAD + , producing NADH .  The sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition of a second phosphate group , producing 1,3- bisphosphoglycerate . Note that the second phosphate group does not require another ATP molecule ."
47,GTP or ATP is produced during the conversion of ________.,"Step 5 . In step five , a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme A , and a high-energy bond is formed .  This energy is used in substrate-level phosphorylation ( during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate ) to form either guanine triphosphate ( GTP ) or ATP .  There are two forms of the enzyme , called isoenzymes , for this step , depending upon the type of animal tissue in which they are found . One form is found in tissues that use large amounts of ATP , such as heart and skeletal muscle . This form produces ATP . The second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways , such as liver . This form produces GTP . GTP is energetically equivalent to ATP ; however , its use is more restricted . In particular , protein synthesis primarily uses GTP ."
47,How many NADH molecules are produced on each turn of the citric acid cycle?,"Two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group , representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose molecule . Two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle ; however , these do not necessarily contain the most recently added carbon atoms . The two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle ; thus , all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide .  Each turn of the cycle forms three NADH molecules and one FADH 2 molecule .  These carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration to produce ATP molecules . One GTP or ATP is also made in each cycle . Several of the intermediate compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing non-essential amino acids ; therefore , the cycle is amphibolic ( both catabolic and anabolic ) . 7.4 Oxidative Phosphorylation Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
47,What compound receives electrons from NADH?," To start , two electrons are carried to the first complex aboard NADH .   This complex , labeled I , is composed of flavin mononucleotide ( FMN ) and an iron-sulfur ( Fe-S ) - containing protein .  FMN , which is derived from vitamin B 2 , also called riboflavin , is one of several prosthetic groups or co-factors in the electron transport chain . A prosthetic group is a non-protein molecule required for the activity of a protein . Prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic , non-peptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its function ; prosthetic groups include co-enzymes , which are the prosthetic groups of enzymes . The enzyme in complex I is NADH dehydrogenase and is a very large protein , containing 45 amino acid chains . Complex I can pump four hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix into the intermembrane space , and it is in this way that the hydrogen ion gradient is established and maintained between the two compartments separated by the inner mitochondrial membrane ."
47,Chemiosmosis involves ________.," In chemiosmosis , the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions ( protons ) across the membrane .  The uneven distribution of H + ions across the membrane establishes both concentration and electrical gradients ( thus , an electrochemical gradient ) , owing to the hydrogen ions ’ positive charge and their aggregation on one side of the membrane ."
47,Which of the following fermentation methods can occur in animal skeletal muscles?," The fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria , like those in yogurt , is lactic acid fermentation ( Figure 7.14 ) .   This type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has an insufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration to continue ( that is , in muscles used to the point of fatigue ) .  In muscles , lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation and the lactate brought to the liver for further metabolism . The chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation are the following :"
47,A major connection for sugars in glycolysis is ________.,"Step 2 .  In the second step of glycolysis , an isomerase converts glucose - 6 - phosphate into one of its isomers , fructose - 6 - phosphate .  An isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers .  ( This change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules .  ) . Step 1 .  The first step in glycolysis ( Figure 7.6 ) is catalyzed by hexokinase , an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars .   Hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using ATP as the source of the phosphate , producing glucose - 6 - phosphate , a more reactive form of glucose .  This reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from continuing to interact with the GLUT proteins , and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane ."
47,Beta-oxidation is ________.,"Triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals . Triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids . Animals can make most of the fatty acids they need . Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the glucose catabolism pathways . Glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol - 3 - phosphate , which continues through glycolysis .  Fatty acids are catabolized in a process called beta-oxidation that takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts their fatty acid chains into two carbon units of acetyl groups .  The acetyl groups are picked up by CoA to form acetyl CoA that proceeds into the citric acid cycle ."
47,The effect of high levels of ADP is to ________.,"Step 3 . The third step is the phosphorylation of fructose - 6 - phosphate , catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase . A second ATP molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose - 6 - phosphate , producing fructose -1,6- bi sphosphate .  In this pathway , phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme .   It is active when the concentration of ADP is high ; it is less active when ADP levels are low and the concentration of ATP is high .  Thus , if there is “ sufficient ” ATP in the system , the pathway slows down . This is a type of end product inhibition , since ATP is the end product of glucose catabolism ."
47,The control of which enzyme exerts the most control on glycolysis?," Phosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis .  High levels of ATP , citrate , or a lower , more acidic pH decrease the enzyme ’ s activity . An increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle . Fermentation , with its production of organic acids like lactic acid , frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell ; however , the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells ."
48,Which of the following statements about blood is true?,"The normal temperature of blood is slightly higher than normal body temperature — about 38 ° C ( or 100.4 ° F ) , compared to 37 ° C ( or 98.6 ° F ) for an internal body temperature reading , although daily variations of 0.5 ° C are normal . Although the surface of blood vessels is relatively smooth , as blood flows through them , it experiences some friction and resistance , especially as vessels age and lose their elasticity , thereby producing heat . This accounts for its slightly higher temperature .  The pH of blood averages about 7.4 ; however , it can range from 7.35 to 7.45 in a healthy person .  Blood is therefore somewhat more basic ( alkaline ) on a chemical scale than pure water , which has a pH of 7.0 . Blood contains numerous buffers that actually help to regulate pH .  Blood is viscous and somewhat sticky to the touch .   It has a viscosity approximately five times greater than water .  Viscosity is a measure of a fluid ’ s thickness or resistance to flow , and is influenced by the presence of the plasma proteins and formed elements within the blood . The viscosity of blood has a dramatic impact on blood pressure and flow . Consider the difference in flow between water and honey . The more viscous honey would demonstrate a greater resistance to flow than the less viscous water . The same principle applies to blood ."
48,Which of the following statements about albumin is true?," Albumin is the most abundant of the plasma proteins .  Manufactured by the liver , albumin molecules serve as binding proteins — transport vehicles for fatty acids and steroid hormones . Recall that lipids are hydrophobic ; however , their binding to albumin enables their transport in the watery plasma . Albumin is also the most significant contributor to the osmotic pressure of blood ; that is , its presence holds water inside the blood vessels and draws water from the tissues , across blood vessel walls , and into the bloodstream . This in turn helps to maintain both blood volume and blood pressure . Albumin normally accounts for approximately 54 percent of the total plasma protein content , in clinical levels of 3.5 – 5.0 g / dL blood ."
48,Which of the following plasma proteins is not produced by the liver?,"The least abundant plasma protein is fibrinogen .  Like albumin and the alpha and beta globulins , fibrinogen is produced by the liver .  It is essential for blood clotting , a process described later in this chapter . Fibrinogen accounts for about 7 percent of the total plasma protein volume , in clinical levels of 0.2 – 0.45 g / dL blood . The second most common plasma proteins are the globulins . A heterogeneous group , there are three main subgroups known as alpha , beta , and gamma globulins . The alpha and beta globulins transport iron , lipids , and the fat-soluble vitamins A , D , E , and K to the cells ; like albumin , they also contribute to osmotic pressure . The gamma globulins are proteins involved in immunity and are better known as an antibodies or immunoglobulins .  Although other plasma proteins are produced by the liver , immunoglobulins are produced by specialized leukocytes known as plasma cells .  ( Seek additional content for more information about immunoglobulins . ) Globulins make up approximately 38 percent of the total plasma protein volume , in clinical levels of 1.0 – 1.5 g / dL blood ."
48,Which of the formed elements arise from myeloid stem cells?," Myeloid stem cells give rise to all the other formed elements , including the erythrocytes ; megakaryocytes that produce platelets ; and a myeloblast lineage that gives rise to monocytes and three forms of granular leukocytes : neutrophils , eosinophils , and basophils . "
48,Interleukins are associated primarily with which of the following?,"Interleukins are another class of cytokine signaling molecules important in hemopoiesis . They were initially thought to be secreted uniquely by leukocytes and to communicate only with other leukocytes , and were named accordingly , but are now known to be produced by a variety of cells including bone marrow and endothelium .  Researchers now suspect that interleukins may play other roles in body functioning , including differentiation and maturation of cells , producing immunity and inflammation .  To date , more than a dozen interleukins have been identified , with others likely to follow . They are generally numbered IL - 1 , IL - 2 , IL - 3 , etc ."
48,"Which of the following statements about mature, circulating erythrocytes is true?"," Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation , after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid phagocytic cell called a macrophage , located primarily within the bone marrow , liver , and spleen .  The components of the degraded erythrocytes ’ hemoglobin are further processed as follows :  As an erythrocyte matures in the red bone marrow , it extrudes its nucleus and most of its other organelles .  During the first day or two that it is in the circulation , an immature erythrocyte , known as a reticulocyte , will still typically contain remnants of organelles . Reticulocytes should comprise approximately 1 – 2 percent of the erythrocyte count and provide a rough estimate of the rate of RBC production , with abnormally low or high rates indicating deviations in the production of these cells . These remnants , primarily of networks ( reticulum ) of ribosomes , are quickly shed , however , and mature , circulating erythrocytes have few internal cellular structural components . Lacking mitochondria , for example , they rely on anaerobic respiration . This means that they do not utilize any of the oxygen they are transporting , so they can deliver it all to the tissues . They also lack endoplasmic reticula and do not synthesize proteins . Erythrocytes do , however , contain some structural proteins that help the blood cells maintain their unique structure and enable them to change their shape to squeeze through capillaries . This includes the protein spectrin , a cytoskeletal protein element ."
48,A molecule of hemoglobin ________.," Hemoglobin is a large molecule made up of proteins and iron .   It consists of four folded chains of a protein called globin , designated alpha 1 and 2 , and beta 1 and 2 ( Figure 18.7 a ) .   Each of these globin molecules is bound to a red pigment molecule called heme , which contains an ion of iron ( Fe 2 + ) ( Figure 18.7 b ) .  Each iron ion in the heme can bind to one oxygen molecule ; therefore , each hemoglobin molecule can transport four oxygen molecules . An individual erythrocyte may contain about 300 million hemoglobin molecules , and therefore can bind to and transport up to 1.2 billion oxygen molecules ( see Figure 18.7 b ) ."
48,The production of healthy erythrocytes depends upon the availability of ________.," B vitamins .  The B vitamins folate and vitamin B 12 function as co-enzymes that facilitate DNA synthesis . Thus , both are critical for the synthesis of new cells , including erythrocytes .  Zinc .  The trace mineral zinc functions as a co-enzyme that facilitates the synthesis of the heme portion of hemoglobin .  Copper .  A trace mineral , copper is a component of two plasma proteins , hephaestin and ceruloplasmin . Without these , hemoglobin could not be adequately produced . Located in intestinal villi , hephaestin enables iron to be absorbed by intestinal cells . Ceruloplasmin transports copper . Both enable the oxidation of iron from Fe 2 + to Fe 3 + , a form in which it can be bound to its transport protein , transferrin , for transport to body cells . In a state of copper deficiency , the transport of iron for heme synthesis decreases , and iron can accumulate in tissues , where it can eventually lead to organ damage .  Iron .  We have said that each heme group in a hemoglobin molecule contains an ion of the trace mineral iron . On average , less than 20 percent of the iron we consume is absorbed . Heme iron , from animal foods such as meat , poultry , and fish , is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron from plant foods . Upon absorption , iron becomes part of the body ’ s total iron pool . The bone marrow , liver , and spleen can store iron in the protein compounds ferritin and hemosiderin . Ferroportin transports the iron across the intestinal cell plasma membranes and from its storage sites into tissue fluid where it enters the blood . When EPO stimulates the production of erythrocytes , iron is released from storage , bound to transferrin , and carried to the red marrow where it attaches to erythrocyte precursors .  Production of erythrocytes in the marrow occurs at the staggering rate of more than 2 million cells per second .  For this production to occur , a number of raw materials must be present in adequate amounts . These include the same nutrients that are essential to the production and maintenance of any cell , such as glucose , lipids , and amino acids .  However , erythrocyte production also requires several trace elements : "
48,Aging and damaged erythrocytes are removed from the circulation by ________.," Erythrocytes live up to 120 days in the circulation , after which the worn-out cells are removed by a type of myeloid phagocytic cell called a macrophage , located primarily within the bone marrow , liver , and spleen .  The components of the degraded erythrocytes ’ hemoglobin are further processed as follows :"
48,"A patient has been suffering for 2 months with a chronic, watery diarrhea. A blood test is likely to reveal ________.","In contrast to anemia , an elevated RBC count is called polycythemia and is detected in a patient ’ s elevated hematocrit .  It can occur transiently in a person who is dehydrated ; when water intake is inadequate or water losses are excessive , the plasma volume falls .   As a result , the hematocrit rises .   For reasons mentioned earlier , a mild form of polycythemia is chronic but normal in people living at high altitudes .  Some elite athletes train at high elevations specifically to induce this phenomenon . Finally , a type of bone marrow disease called polycythemia vera ( from the Greek vera = “ true ” ) causes an excessive production of immature erythrocytes .  Polycythemia vera can dangerously elevate the viscosity of blood , raising blood pressure and making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood throughout the body .  It is a relatively rare disease that occurs more often in men than women , and is more likely to be present in elderly patients those over 60 years of age . 18.4 Leukocytes and Platelets Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to :"
48,The process by which leukocytes squeeze through adjacent cells in a blood vessel wall is called ________.,"One of the most distinctive characteristics of leukocytes is their movement . Whereas erythrocytes spend their days circulating within the blood vessels , leukocytes routinely leave the bloodstream to perform their defensive functions in the body ’ s tissues . For leukocytes , the vascular network is simply a highway they travel and soon exit to reach their true destination . When they arrive , they are often given distinct names , such as macrophage or microglia , depending on their function .  As shown in Figure 18.10 , they leave the capillaries — the smallest blood vessels — or other small vessels through a process known as emigration ( from the Latin for “ removal ” ) or diapedesis ( dia - = “ through ” ; - pedan = “ to leap ” ) in which they squeeze through adjacent cells in a blood vessel wall . "
48,Which of the following describes a neutrophil?," Neutrophils are rapid responders to the site of infection and are efficient phagocytes with a preference for bacteria .  Their granules include lysozyme , an enzyme capable of lysing , or breaking down , bacterial cell walls ; oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide ; and defensins , proteins that bind to and puncture bacterial and fungal plasma membranes , so that the cell contents leak out . Abnormally high counts of neutrophils indicate infection and / or inflammation , particularly triggered by bacteria , but are also found in burn patients and others experiencing unusual stress . A burn injury increases the proliferation of neutrophils in order to fight off infection that can result from the destruction of the barrier of the skin . Low counts may be caused by drug toxicity and other disorders , and may increase an individual ’ s susceptibility to infection .  The most common of all the leukocytes , neutrophils will normally comprise 50 – 70 percent of total leukocyte count .  They are 10 – 12 µ m in diameter , significantly larger than erythrocytes . They are called neutrophils because their granules show up most clearly with stains that are chemically neutral ( neither acidic nor basic ) . The granules are numerous but quite fine and normally appear light lilac . The nucleus has a distinct lobed appearance and may have two to five lobes , the number increasing with the age of the cell . Older neutrophils have increasing numbers of lobes and are often referred to as polymorphonuclear ( a nucleus with many forms ) , or simply “ polys . ” Younger and immature neutrophils begin to develop lobes and are known as “ bands . ”"
48,T and B lymphocytes ________.," B cells and T cells , also called B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes , play prominent roles in defending the body against specific pathogens ( disease-causing microorganisms ) and are involved in specific immunity .  One form of B cells ( plasma cells ) produces the antibodies or immunoglobulins that bind to specific foreign or abnormal components of plasma membranes . This is also referred to as humoral ( body fluid ) immunity . T cells provide cellular-level immunity by physically attacking foreign or diseased cells . A memory cell is a variety of both B and T cells that forms after exposure to a pathogen and mounts rapid responses upon subsequent exposures . Unlike other leukocytes , memory cells live for many years . B cells undergo a maturation process in the b one marrow , whereas T cells undergo maturation in the t hymus . This site of the maturation process gives rise to the name B and T cells . The functions of lymphocytes are complex and will be covered in detail in the chapter covering the lymphatic system and immunity . Smaller lymphocytes are either B or T cells , although they cannot be differentiated in a normal blood smear . Abnormally high lymphocyte counts are characteristic of viral infections as well as some types of cancer . Abnormally low lymphocyte counts are characteristic of prolonged ( chronic ) illness or immunosuppression , including that caused by HIV infection and drug therapies that often involve steroids ."
48,Thrombocytes are more accurately called ________.," You may occasionally see platelets referred to as thrombocytes , but because this name suggests they are a type of cell , it is not accurate .  A platelet is not a cell but rather a fragment of the cytoplasm of a cell called a megakaryocyte that is surrounded by a plasma membrane . Megakaryocytes are descended from myeloid stem cells ( see Figure 18.4 ) and are large , typically 50 – 100 µ m in diameter , and contain an enlarged , lobed nucleus . As noted earlier , thrombopoietin , a glycoprotein secreted by the kidneys and liver , stimulates the proliferation of megakaryoblasts , which mature into megakaryocytes . These remain within bone marrow tissue ( Figure 18.12 ) and ultimately form platelet-precursor extensions that extend through the walls of bone marrow capillaries to release into the circulation thousands of cytoplasmic fragments , each enclosed by a bit of plasma membrane . These enclosed fragments are platelets . Each megakarocyte releases 2000 – 3000 platelets during its lifespan . Following platelet release , megakaryocyte remnants , which are little more than a cell nucleus , are consumed by macrophages . Platelets are relatively small , 2 – 4 µ m in diameter , but numerous , with typically 150,000 – 160,000 per µ L of blood . After entering the circulation , approximately one-third migrate to the spleen for storage for later release in response to any rupture in a blood vessel . They then become activated to perform their primary function , which is to limit blood loss . Platelets remain only about 10 days , then are phagocytized by macrophages ."
48,The first step in hemostasis is ________.,"Platelets are key players in hemostasis , the process by which the body seals a ruptured blood vessel and prevents further loss of blood .  Although rupture of larger vessels usually requires medical intervention , hemostasis is quite effective in dealing with small , simple wounds .   There are three steps to the process : vascular spasm , the formation of a platelet plug , and coagulation ( blood clotting ) .  Failure of any of these steps will result in hemorrhage — excessive bleeding ."
48,Prothrombin is converted to thrombin during the ________.,"An anticoagulant is any substance that opposes coagulation . Several circulating plasma anticoagulants play a role in limiting the coagulation process to the region of injury and restoring a normal , clot-free condition of blood . For instance , a cluster of proteins collectively referred to as the protein C system inactivates clotting factors involved in the intrinsic pathway . TFPI ( tissue factor pathway inhibitor ) inhibits the conversion of the inactive factor VII to the active form in the extrinsic pathway .  Antithrombin inactivates factor X and opposes the conversion of prothrombin ( factor II ) to thrombin in the common pathway .  And as noted earlier , basophils release heparin , a short-acting anticoagulant that also opposes prothrombin . Heparin is also found on the surfaces of cells lining the blood vessels . A pharmaceutical form of heparin is often administered therapeutically , for example , in surgical patients at risk for blood clots . Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways lead to the common pathway , in which fibrin is produced to seal off the vessel .  Once factor X has been activated by either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway , the enzyme prothrombinase converts factor II , the inactive enzyme prothrombin , into the active enzyme thrombin .  ( Note that if the enzyme thrombin were not normally in an inactive form , clots would form spontaneously , a condition not consistent with life . ) Then , thrombin converts factor I , the soluble fibrinogen , into the insoluble fibrin protein strands . Factor XIII then stabilizes the fibrin clot ."
48,Hemophilia is characterized by ________.," Another reason for failure of the blood to clot is the inadequate production of functional amounts of one or more clotting factors .   This is the case in the genetic disorder hemophilia , which is actually a group of related disorders , the most common of which is hemophilia A , accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases .  This disorder results in the inability to synthesize sufficient quantities of factor VIII . Hemophilia B is the second most common form , accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases . In this case , there is a deficiency of factor IX . Both of these defects are linked to the X chromosome and are typically passed from a healthy ( carrier ) mother to her male offspring , since males are XY . Females would need to inherit a defective gene from each parent to manifest the disease , since they are XX . Patients with hemophilia bleed from even minor internal and external wounds , and leak blood into joint spaces after exercise and into urine and stool . Hemophilia C is a rare condition that is triggered by an autosomal ( not sex ) chromosome that renders factor XI nonfunctional . It is not a true recessive condition , since even individuals with a single copy of the mutant gene show a tendency to bleed . Regular infusions of clotting factors isolated from healthy donors can help prevent bleeding in hemophiliac patients . At some point , genetic therapy will become a viable option ."
48,"The process in which antibodies attach to antigens, causing the formation of masses of linked cells, is called ________."," Because the arms of the Y-shaped antibodies attach randomly to more than one nonself erythrocyte surface , they form clumps of erythrocytes .   This process is called agglutination .  Antigens are generally large proteins , but may include other classes of organic molecules , including carbohydrates , lipids , and nucleic acids . Following an infusion of incompatible blood , erythrocytes with foreign antigens appear in the bloodstream and trigger an immune response .  Proteins called antibodies ( immunoglobulins ) , which are produced by certain B lymphocytes called plasma cells , attach to the antigens on the plasma membranes of the infused erythrocytes and cause them to adhere to one another . "
48,People with ABO blood type O ________.,"Normally the body must be exposed to a foreign antigen before an antibody can be produced . This is not the case for the ABO blood group . Individuals with type A blood — without any prior exposure to incompatible blood — have preformed antibodies to the B antigen circulating in their blood plasma . These antibodies , referred to as anti-B antibodies , will cause agglutination and hemolysis if they ever encounter erythrocytes with B antigens . Similarly , an individual with type B blood has pre-formed anti-A antibodies . Individuals with type AB blood , which has both antigens , do not have preformed antibodies to either of these .  People with type O blood lack antigens A and B on their erythrocytes , but both anti-A and anti-B antibodies circulate in their blood plasma . "
48,Hemolytic disease of the newborn is a risk during a subsequent pregnancy in which ________.,"Table 18.2 In contrast to the ABO group antibodies , which are preformed , antibodies to the Rh antigen are produced only in Rh − individuals after exposure to the antigen . This process , called sensitization , occurs following a transfusion with Rh-incompatible blood or , more commonly , with the birth of an Rh + baby to an Rh − mother . Problems are rare in a first pregnancy , since the baby ’ s Rh + cells rarely cross the placenta ( the organ of gas and nutrient exchange between the baby and the mother ) . However , during or immediately after birth , the Rh − mother can be exposed to the baby ’ s Rh + cells ( Figure 18.15 ) . Research has shown that this occurs in about 13 − 14 percent of such pregnancies . After exposure , the mother ’ s immune system begins to generate anti-Rh antibodies .  If the mother should then conceive another Rh + baby , the Rh antibodies she has produced can cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream and destroy the fetal RBCs .   This condition , known as hemolytic disease of the newborn ( HDN ) or erythroblastosis fetalis , may cause anemia in mild cases , but the agglutination and hemolysis can be so severe that without treatment the fetus may die in the womb or shortly after birth .
