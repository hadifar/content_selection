The soil is dried out and dusty. Plants may be few and far between. Dry, bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than wetter soil or soil held in place by plant roots. ", "Like flowing water, wind picks up and transports particles. Wind carries particles of different sizes in the same ways that water carries them. You can see this in Figure 10.21. Tiny particles, such as clay and silt, move by suspension. They hang in the air, sometimes for days. They may be carried great distances and rise high above the ground. Larger particles, such as sand, move by saltation. The wind blows them in short hops. They stay close to the ground. Particles larger than sand move by traction. The wind rolls or pushes them over the surface. They stay on the ground. ", "Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it? Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and debris. Wind-blown sand has the same effect. It scours and polishes rocks and other surfaces. Wind-blown sand may carve rocks into interesting shapes. You can see an example in Figure 10.22. This form of erosion is called abrasion. It occurs any time rough sediments are blown or dragged over surfaces. Can you think of other ways abrasion might occur? ", "Like water, when wind slows down it drops the sediment its carrying. This often happens when the wind has to move over or around an obstacle. A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down. As the wind slows, it deposits the largest particles first. Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited. ", "When the wind deposits sand, it forms small hills of sand. These hills are called sand dunes. For sand dunes to form, there must be plenty of sand and wind. Sand dunes are found mainly in deserts and on beaches. You can see examples of sand dunes in Figure 10.23. ", "What causes a sand dune to form? It starts with an obstacle, such as a rock. The obstacle causes the wind to slow down. The wind then drops some of its sand. As more sand is deposited, the dune gets bigger. The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind and causes it to drop its sand. The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune, shown in Figure 10.24. ", "Once a sand dune forms, it may slowly migrate over the land. The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune. This is done by saltation. When the sand grains reach the top of the dune, they slip down the steeper side. The grains are pulled by gravity. The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground. It always moves in the same direction that the wind usually blows. Can you explain why? ", "When the wind drops fine particles of silt and clay, it forms deposits called loess. Loess deposits form vertical cliffs. Loess can become a thick, rich soil. Thats why loess deposits are used for farming in many parts of the world. You can see an example of loess in Figure 10.25. ", "Its very important to control wind erosion of soil. Good soil is a precious resource that takes a long time to form. Covering soil with plants is one way to reduce wind erosion. Plants and their roots help hold the soil in place. They also help the soil retain water so it is less likely to blow away. Planting rows of trees around fields is another way to reduce wind erosion. The trees slow down the wind, so it doesnt cause as much erosion. Fences like the one in Figure 10.26 serve the same purpose. The fence in the figure is preventing erosion and migration of sand dunes on a beach.

This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Air moves because of differences in heating. These differences create convection currents and winds. Figure 15.19 shows how this happens. Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground. The warm air rises because it is light. The light, rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface. The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere. The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface. The sinking, heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground. Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Air flowing over Earths surface is called wind. The greater the difference in pressure, the stronger the wind blows. ", "Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area. They are influenced by local geography. Nearness to an ocean, lake or mountain range can affect local winds. Some examples are found below. ", "Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land. So the sea surface is cooler than the land in the daytime. It is also cooler than the land in the summer. The opposite is also true. The water stays warmer than the land during the night and the winter. These differences in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes. Land and sea breezes are illustrated in Figure 15.20. A sea breeze blows from sea to land during the day or in summer. Thats when air over the land is warmer than air over the water. The warm air rises. Cool air from over the water flows in to take its place. A land breeze blows from land to sea during the night or in winter. Thats when air over the water is warmer than air over the land. The warm air rises. Cool air from the land flows out to take its place. ", "Monsoons are like land and sea breezes, but on a larger scale. They occur because of seasonal changes in the temperature of land and water. In the winter, they blow from land to water. In the summer, they blow from water to land. In regions that experience monsoons, the seawater offshore is extremely warm. The hot air absorbs a lot of the moisture and carries it over the land. Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land. Monsoons occur in several places around the globe. The most important monsoon in the world is in southern Asia, as shown in Figure 15.21. These monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there. ", "Global winds are winds that occur in belts that go all around the planet. You can see them in Figure 15.22. Like local winds, global winds are caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere. ", "Earth is hottest at the equator and gets cooler toward the poles. The differences in heating create huge convection currents in the troposphere. At the equator, for example, warm air rises up to the tropopause. It cant rise any higher, so it flows north or south. By the time the moving air reaches 30 N or S latitude, it has cooled. The cool air sinks to the surface. Then it flows over the surface back to the equator. Other global winds occur in much the same way. There are three enormous convection cells north of the equator and three south of the equator. ", "Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface. This causes the Coriolis effect. Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface, instead of due north or south. From which direction do the northern trade winds blow? Without Coriolis Effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north. But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The winds blow northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere. The wind belts have names. The Trade Winds are nearest the equator. The next belt is the westerlies. Finally are the polar easterlies. The names are the same in both hemispheres. ", "Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere. They are also the result of unequal heating of the atmosphere. Jet streams circle the planet, mainly from west to east. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets.

Air masses that form over oceans are called maritime air masses. Those that form over continents are called continental air masses. Figure 16.6 shows air masses that form over or near North America.

Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions. For example, a warm air mass moving over cold ground may cause an inversion. Why do air masses move? Winds and jet streams push them along. Cold air masses tend to move toward the equator. Warm air masses tend to move toward the poles. Coriolis effect causes them to move on a diagonal. Many air masses move toward the northeast over the U.S. This is the same direction that global winds blow. ", "When cold air masses move south from the poles, they run into warm air masses moving north from the tropics. The boundary between two air masses is called a front. Air masses usually dont mix at a front. The differences in temperature and pressure cause clouds and precipitation. Types of fronts include cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts. ", "A cold front occurs when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass. This is shown in Figure 16.7. The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass and lifts the warm air mass out of its way. As the warm air rises, its water vapor condenses. Clouds form, and precipitation falls. If the warm air is very humid, precipitation can be heavy. Temperature and pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds. Winds may be very strong along a cold front. As the fast-moving cold air mass keeps advancing, so does the cold front. Cold fronts often bring sudden changes in the weather. There may be a thin line of storms right at the front that moves as it moves. In the spring and summer, these storms may be thunderstorms and tornadoes. In the late fall and winter, snow storms may occur. After a cold front passes, the cold air mass behind it brings cooler temperatures. The air is likely to be less humid as well. Can you explain why? ", "When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front. This is shown in Figure 16.8. The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass, so it flows up over the cold air mass. As the warm air rises, it cools, resulting in clouds and sometimes light precipitation. Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area. After a warm front passes, the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures. The warm air is also likely to be more humid. ", "With an occluded front, a warm air mass becomes trapped between two cold air masses. The warm air is lifted up above the cold air as in Figure 16.9. Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical. ", "Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet. These stalled air masses create a stationary front. Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days. ", "Cold air is dense, so it sinks. This creates a center of high pressure. Warm air is less dense so it rises. This creates a center of low pressure. Air always flows from higher to lower pressure. As the air flows, Earths surface rotates below it causing Coriolis effect. So while the wind blows into the low pressure, it revolves in a circular pattern. This wind pattern forms a cyclone. The same happens while the wind blows out of a high pressure. This forms an anticyclone. Both are shown in Figure 16.10. A cyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of low pressure. Cyclones bring cloudy, wet weather. An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high pressure. Anticyclones bring fair, dry weather.

", "Air temperature falls at higher altitudes. You can see this in Figure 17.6. Why does this happen? Since air is less dense at higher altitudes, its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level. These molecules have fewer collisions, so they produce less heat.

At the bottom of the mountain, the temperature is high year round. How can you tell that its much cooler at the top? ", "Mountains can also affect precipitation. Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow. As winds rise up a mountain range the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range the air is dry and it sinks.

Some modern thermometers use a coiled strip composed of two kinds of metal, each of which conducts heat differently. As the temperature rises and falls, the coil unfolds or curls up tighter.

Evolutionary processes act rapidly during An extinct Tyrannosaurus rex. This fossil resembles a living organism. these times and many new species evolve to fill those available habitats. The process in which many new species evolve in a short period of time to fill available niches is called adaptive radiation. At the end of this period of rapid evolution the life forms do not look much like the ones that were around before the mass extinction. For example, after the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals underwent adaptive radiation and became the dominant life form.

Scientists now think that some dinosaurs were endotherms (warm-blooded) due to the evidence that has been collected over the decades. There are still some scientists who do not agree, but the amount of evidence makes it likely. Some dinosaurs lived in polar regions where animals that needed sunlight for warmth could not survive in winter. Dinosaurs bones had canals, similar to those of birds, indicating that they grew fast and were very active. Fast growth usually indicates an active metabolism typical of endotherms. Dinosaurs had erect posture and large brains, both correlated with endothermy. The earliest known fossil of a flowering plant is this 125 million year old Creta- ceous fossil. ", "Mammals appeared near the end of the Triassic, but the Mesozoic is known as the age of the reptiles. In a great advance over amphibians, which must live near water, reptiles developed adaptations for living away from water. Their thick skin keeps them from drying out, and the evolution of the amniote egg allowed them to lay their eggs on dry land. The amniote egg has a shell and contains all the nutrients and water required for the developing embryo . ", "Between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic, 65 million years ago, about 50% of all animal species, including the dinosaurs, became extinct. Although there are other hypotheses, most scientists think that this mass extinction took place when a giant meteorite struck Earth with 2 million times the energy of the most powerful nuclear weapon . The impact kicked up a massive dust cloud, and when the particles rained back onto the surface they heated the atmosphere until it became as hot as a kitchen oven. Animals roasted. Dust that remained in the atmosphere blocked sunlight for a year or more, causing a deep freeze and temporarily ending photosynthesis. Sulfur from the impact mixed with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which dissolved the shells of the tiny marine plankton that form the base of the food chain. With little food being produced by land plants and plankton, animals starved. Carbon dioxide was also released from the impact and eventually caused global warming. Life forms could not survive the dramatic temperature swings. You may be surprised to know that dinosaurs in one form survived the mass extinctions and live all over the world today. Birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs, and these creatures not only survived the asteroid impact and its aftermath, but they have also diversified into some of the most fantastic creatures we know .

The Burgess shale formation in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, contains an amazing diversity of middle Cambrian life forms, from about 505 million years ago.

The abundant swamps became the coal and petroleum deposits that are the source of much of our fossil fuels today.

About 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species (land animals) suffered the same fate. This was the only known mass extinction of insects.

These computers have up-to-date mathematical models that can use much more data and make many more calculations than would ever be possible by scientists working with just maps and calculators. Meteorologists can use these results to give much more accurate weather forecasts and climate predictions. In Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), atmospheric data from many sources are plugged into supercomputers running complex mathematical models . The models then calculate what will happen over time at various altitudes for a grid of evenly spaced locations. The grid points are usually between 10 and 200 kilometers apart. Using the results calculated by the model, the program projects weather further into the future. It then uses these results to project the weather still further into the future, as far as the meteorologists want to go. Once a forecast is made, it is broadcast by satellites to more than 1,000 sites around the world. NWP produces the most accurate weather forecasts, but as anyone knows, even the best forecasts are not always right.

At higher altitudes the atmospheric pressure is lower and the air is less dense than at lower altitudes. Thats what makes your ears pop when you change altitude. Gas molecules are found inside and outside your ears. When you change altitude quickly, like when an airplane is descending, your inner ear keeps the density of molecules at the original altitude.

Amphibians cant live too far from the water. Large animals generally do better in cold climates than in hot climates. Despite this, every ecosystem has the same general roles that living creatures fill. Its just the organisms that fill those niches that are different. For example, every ecosystem must have some organisms that produce food in the form of chemical energy.

Organisms that produce their own food are called producers. There are two ways of producing food energy: Photosynthesis: plants on land, phytoplankton in the surface ocean, and some other organisms. Chemosynthesis: bacteria at hydrothermal vents. Organisms that use the food energy that was created by producers are named consumers. There are many types of consumers: Herbivores eat producers directly. These animals break down the plant structures to get the materials and energy they need. Carnivores eat animals; they can eat herbivores or other carnivores. Omnivores eat plants and animals as well as fungi, bacteria, and organisms from the other kingdoms.

Competition occurs between species that try to use the same resources. When there is too much competition, one species may move or adapt so that it uses slightly different resources. It may live at the tops of trees and eat leaves that are somewhat higher on bushes, for example. If the competition does not end, one species will die out. Each niche can only be inhabited by one species. Some relationships between species are beneficial to at least one of the two interacting species. These relationships are known as symbiosis and there are three types: In mutualism, the relationship benefits both species. Most plant-pollinator relationships are mutually benefi- cial. What does each get from the relationship? In commensalism, one organism benefits and the other is not harmed. In parasitism, the parasite species benefits and the host is harmed.

Scientific proposals are reviewed by other scientists in the field and are evaluated for funding. In many fields, the funding rate is low and the money goes only to the most worthy research projects. The scientific community monitors scientific integrity. During their training, students learn how to conduct good scientific experiments. They learn not to fake, hide, or selectively report data, and they learn how to fairly evaluate data and the work of other scientists. Scientists who do not have scientific integrity are strongly condemned by the scientific community. Nothing is perfect, but considering all the scientific research that is done, there are few incidences of scientific dishonesty. Yet when they do occur, they are often reported with great vehemence by the media. Often this causes the public to mistrust scientists in ways that are unwarranted.

When gas molecules are cool, they are sluggish and do not take up as much space. With the same number of molecules in less space, both air density and air pressure are higher. When gas molecules are warm, they move vigorously and take up more space. Air density and air pressure are lower. Warmer, lighter air is more buoyant than the cooler air above it, so it rises. The cooler air then sinks down, because it is denser than the air beneath it. This is convection, which was described in the chapter Plate Tectonics.

A locations climate can be described by its air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and the type, quantity, and frequency of precipitation. The climate for a particular place is steady, and changes only very slowly. Climate is determined by many factors, including the angle of the Sun, the likelihood of cloud cover, and the air pressure. All of these factors are related to the amount of energy that is found in that location over time. The climate of a region depends on its position relative to many things.

Science is a way of learning about the natural world that depends on evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing. Scientists explain the world based on their observations. If they develop new ideas about the way the world works, they set up ways to test these new ideas. Scientific knowledge keeps changing because scientists are always doing science. ", "When Miranda and Jeanny wondered whether bacteria might decompose plastic, they were thinking like a scientist. What does it mean to think like a scientist? A scientist is observant. Miranda and Jeanny observed all the plastic trash when they visited a landfill. They also saw a lot of plastic trash along a local river. A scientist wonders and asks questions. Miranda and Jeanny wondered if any bacteria could help break down plastic. They asked: Can some bacteria consume chemicals in plastic for food? A scientist tries to find answers using evidence and logic. Often, a scientist does experiments to gather more evidence and test ideas. Miranda and Jeanny did a lot of online research to find out what other scientists had already learned. Then they did their own experiments. They gathered and tested bacteria. For example, they grew bacteria on gel like the red gel in Figure 1.2. You can learn the details of their research and their amazing results by watching this video: A scientist is skeptical. Claims must be backed by adequate evidence. Miranda and Jeanny repeated their experiments so they were confident in their results. Only then did they draw conclusions. A scientist has an open mind. Scientific knowledge is always evolving as new evidence comes in. Miranda and Jeanny made an important contribution with the evidence they gathered. They discovered two species of bacteria that could consume a harmful chemical in plastic. ", "Some knowledge in science gains the status of a theory. Scientists use the term theory differently than it is used in everyday language. You might say, I think my dad is late because he got stuck in traffic, but its just a theory. In other words, its just one of many possible explanations for why hes late. In science, a theory is much more than that. A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. Scientific theories are tested and confirmed repeatedly. Because theories are broad explanations, they generally help explain many different observations. An example in life science is the theory of evolution by natural selection. It explains how living things change through time as they adapt to their environment. This theory is supported by a huge amount of evidence. The evidence ranges from DNA to fossils like the ones in Figure 1.3. Another sort of scientific knowledge is called a law. A scientific law is a description of what always occurs under certain conditions in nature. In other words, it describes many observations but doesnt explain them. Examples of scientific laws in life science include Mendels laws of inheritance. These laws describe how traits are passed from parents to their offspring.

It also explains why there are so many different species of organisms on Earth today. You can see examples of the incredible diversity of living animals in Figure 1.6. You can read more about the theory of evolution in the chapter Evolution. ", "Most scientific theories were developed by scientists doing basic scientific research. Like other sciences, life science may be either basic or applied science. ", "The aim of basic science is to discover new knowledge. It leads to a better understanding of the natural world. It doesnt necessarily have any practical use. An example of basic research in life science is studying how yeast cells grow and divide. Yeasts are single-celled organisms that are easy to study. By studying yeast cells, life scientists discovered the series of events called the cell cycle. The cell cycle works not only in yeasts but in all other organisms with similar cells. Therefore, this basic research made a major contribution to our understanding of living things. Watch the following animation to learn more about the basic yeast research and the cell cycle. You can also see yeast cells dividing. ", "Knowledge gained by this basic research on yeast cells has been applied to practical problems. Scientists have developed drugs to treat cancer based on knowledge of the cell cycle. Cancer is a disease in which cells divide out of control. The new drugs interfere with the cell cycle of cancer cells, so the cells stop dividing. This is an example of applied science. The aim of applied science is to find solutions to practical problems.

Steps may be followed in a somewhat different order, for example, or steps may be repeated or skipped. 1. Make observations. Observations refer to anything detected with one or more senses. The senses include sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. 2. Ask a question raised by the observations. 3. Form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a potential, testable answer to a scientific question. Testable means that if the hypothesis is false, its possible to find evidence showing that its false. This step usually requires some research. You have to find out what other investigators have already learned about the observations. For example, has anyone already tried to answer the question? What other hypotheses have been proposed? 4. Test the hypothesis. Make predictions based on the hypothesis and then determine if they are correct. This may involve carrying out an experiment. An experiment is a controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab. It investigates the effects of one factor, called the independent variable, on another factor, called the dependent variable. Experimental controls are other factors that might affect the dependent variable. Controls are kept constant so they will not affect the results of the experiment. 5. Analyze the results of the test and draw a conclusion. Do the results agree with the predictions? If so, they provide support for the hypothesis. If not, they disprove the hypothesis. 6. Communicate results. One way is by presenting a poster at a scientific conference, like the scientists in Figure are communicated, scientists should describe their hypothesis and how it was tested in addition to the results of the test. This allows other scientists to repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results. This is called replication. Replication is important because it adds weight to the findings. The results are more likely to be reliable if they can be repeated. ", "You can apply the scientific method to the question that was raised above about athletic ability. Assume you are a life scientist. You observe variation in athletic abilities. Some athletes tend to build more muscle mass. Others tend to develop greater endurance. You ask, Is there a gene that might explain these differences? You research the problem on the Internet. You learn about a gene named ACE that might affect how people respond to athletic training. Based on all of your research, you develop a hypothesis. You hypothesize that people with different versions (D or I) of the ACE gene will respond differently to the same athletic training program. People with D genes will increase their muscle mass but not their endurance. People with I genes will increase their endurance but not their muscle mass. How can you test your hypothesis?

They have specialized nerve cells that can detect light, sound, touch, or other stimuli. Most animals also have a nervous system that can direct the body to respond to the stimuli. All animals can move, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Specialized muscle and nerve tissues work together to allow movement. Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates. It also helps them escape from predators and other dangers. Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food. Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them. (Other heterotrophs, such as fungi, absorb nutrients directly from the environment.) ", "Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle. A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 11.3. Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults undergo meiosis to produce haploid sperm or eggs. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse. The diploid zygote that forms develops into an embryo. The embryo eventually develops into an adult, often going through one or more larval stages on the way. A larva (larvae, plural) is a distinct juvenile form that many animals go through before becoming an adult. The larval form may be very different from the adult form. For example, a caterpillar is the larval form of an insect that becomes a butterfly as an adult. ", "The Animal Kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya Domain.

Being able to judge distances is also important. Primates have five digits (fingers or toes) on each extremity. Unlike the hooves of horses or the paddles of whales, the digits of primates are relatively unspecialized. Therefore, they can be used to do a variety of tasks, including grasping branches and holding tools. Most primates have opposable thumbs. An opposable thumb can be brought into opposition with the other fingers of the same hand. This allows the hand to grasp and hold things. Primates usually rely more on the sense of vision rather than the sense of smell, which is the dominant sense in many other mammals. The importance of vision in primates is reflected by the bony socket that surrounds and protects the primate eye. Primates have widely spaced eyes in the same plane that give them stereoscopic (3-D) vision, needed for judging distances. Some primates, including humans, have also evolved color vision. Primates tend to have bigger brains for their body size than other mammals. This is reflected in their relatively high level of intelligence and their ability to learn new behaviors. Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals their size. They reach maturity later and have longer lifespans. Being dependent on adults for a long maturation period gives young primates plenty of time to learn from their elders. ", "Except for humans and a few other species, most modern primates still live in trees at least some of the time. They live primarily in tropical rain forests of Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Some primates, such as the gibbon in Figure 14.21, have long arms and curving fingers that allow them to swing from branch to branch high up in trees. This way of traveling is called brachiation.

Crocodiles and gharials (large crocodilians with longer jaws) have salivary glands on their tongue, which are used to remove salt from their bodies. This helps with life in a saltwater environment. Crocodilians are often seen lying with their mouths open, a behavior called gaping. One of its functions is probably to cool them down. The crocodilian digestive system is highly adapted to their lifestyle. Crocodilians are known to swallow stones, known as gastroliths, which help digest their prey. The crocodilian stomach is divided into two chambers. The first is powerful and muscular. The other stomach is the most acidic digestive system of any animal. It can digest mostly everything from their prey, including bones, feathers, and horns! All crocodilians are carnivores. They feed on live animals such as birds, small mammals and fish. Crocodilians use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey. One approach is that of the ambush. The crocodilian lies motionless beneath the waters surface with only their nostrils above the water line. This keeps them concealed while they watch for prey that approaches the waters edge. The crocodilian then lunges out of the water, taking their prey by surprise and dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed. The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation, when eggs are kept warm before they hatch. This means that the sex of crocodilians is not determined genetically. If the eggs are kept at a cold or a hot temperature, then their offspring may be all male or all female. To get both male and female offspring, the temperature must be kept within a narrow range. Female crocodilians care for the young after they hatch, providing them with protection until they grow large enough to defend themselves. In many species of crocodilians, the female carries her tiny offspring in her mouth. ", "Like all reptiles, crocodilians have a relatively small brain, but the crocodilian brain is more advanced than those of other reptiles. Because of their aquatic habitat, the eyes, ears, and nostrils are all located on the same \"face\" in a line one after the other. The crocodiles have advanced sensory organs. They see well during the day and may even have color vision, and they also have excellent night vision. A third transparent eyelid, the nictitating membrane, protects their eyes underwater. The eardrums are located behind the eyes and are covered by a movable flap of skin. This flap closes, along with the nostrils and eyes, when they dive. This prevents water from entering their external head openings. Their jaws are covered with sensory pits, which hold bundles of nerve fibers that respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water. Crocodiles can detect vibrations and small pressure changes in water. This makes it possible for them to sense prey and danger even in total darkness, and becomes very useful when the animal is submerged in the water. Like mammals and birds, and unlike other reptiles, crocodiles have a four-chambered heart. But, unlike mammals, blood with and without oxygen can be mixed.

Amphibians! Amphibians are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land. Amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen. There are approximately 6,000 species of amphibians. They have many different body types, physiologies, and habitats, ranging from tropical to subarctic regions. Frogs, toads, salamanders , newts, and caecilians are all types of amphibians. ", "Transition to life on land meant significant changes to both external and internal features. In order to live on land, amphibians replaced gills with another respiratory organ, the lungs. Other adaptations include: One of the many species of amphibian is this dusky salamander. Skin that prevents loss of water. Eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water. An eardrum developed to separate the external ear from the middle ear. A tail that disappears in adulthood (in frogs and toads). ", "Like fish, amphibians are ectothermic vertebrates. They belong to the class Amphibia. There are three orders: 1. Urodela, containing salamanders and newts. 2. Anura, containing frogs and toads. 3. Apoda, containing caecilians. ", "Most amphibians live in fresh water, not salt water. Their habitats can include areas close to springs, streams, rivers, lakes, swamps and ponds. They can be found in moist areas in forests, meadows and marshes. Amphibians can be found almost anywhere there is a source of fresh water. Although there are no true saltwater amphibians, a few can live in brackish (slightly salty) water. Some species do not need any water at all, and several species have also adapted to live in drier environments. Most amphibians still need water to lay their eggs. ", "Amphibians reproduce sexually. The life cycle of amphibians happens in the following stages: 1. Egg Stage: Amphibian eggs are fertilized in a number of ways. External fertilization, employed by most frogs and toads, involves a male gripping a female across her back, almost as if he is squeezing the eggs out of her. The male releases sperm over the females eggs as they are laid. Another method is used by salamanders, whereby the male deposits a packet of sperm onto the ground. The female then pulls it into her cloaca, a single opening for her internal organ systems. Therefore, fertilization occurs internally. By contrast, caecilians and tailed frogs use internal fertilization, just like reptiles, birds, and mammals. The male deposits sperm directly into the females cloaca. 2. Larval stage: When the egg hatches, the organism is legless, lives in water, and breathes with gills, resembling their evolutionary ancestors (fish). 3. During the larval stage, the amphibian slowly transforms into an adult by losing its gills and growing four legs. Once development is complete, it can live on land.

Angiosperms live in a variety of different environments. A water lily, an oak tree, and a barrel cactus, although different, are all angiosperms. ", "Even though flowers may look very different from each other, they do have some structures in common. The structures are explained in the picture below . The green outside of a flower that often looks like a leaf is called the sepal . All of the sepals together are called the calyx, which is usually green and protects the flower before it opens. All of the petals  together are called the corolla. They are bright and colorful to attract a particular pollinator, an animal that carries pollen from one flower to another. Examples of pollinators include birds and insects. Angiosperms are the flowering plants. A complete flower has sepals, petals, sta- mens, and one or more carpels. The next structure is the stamen, consisting of the stalk-like filament that holds up the anther, or pollen sac. The pollen, which is found at the top of the stamen, is the male gametophyte. At the very center is the carpel, which is divided into three different parts: (1) the sticky stigma, where the pollen lands, (2) the tube of the style, and (3) the large, bottom part, known as the ovary. The ovary holds the ovules, the female gametophytes. When the ovules are fertilized, the ovule becomes the seed and the ovary becomes the fruit. The following table summarizes the parts of the flower ( Table 1.1). Part sepals calyx corolla stamens filament anther carpel Definition The green outside of the flower. All of the sepals together, or the outside of the flower. The petals of a flower collectively. The part of the flower that produces pollen. Stalk that holds up the anther. The structure that contains pollen in a flower. Female part of the flower; includes the stigma, style, and ovary. style ovary ovules This image shows the difference between a petal and a sepal. ", "Flowering plants can reproduce two different ways: 1. Self-pollination: Pollen falls on the stigma of the same flower. This way, a seed will be produced that can turn into a genetically identical plant. 2. Cross-fertilization: Pollen from one flower travels to a stigma of a flower on another plant. Pollen travels from flower to flower by wind or by animals. Flowers that are pollinated by animals such as birds, butterflies, or bees are often colorful and provide nectar, a sugary reward, for their animal pollinators. ", "Angiosperms are important to humans in many ways, but the most significant role of angiosperms is as food. Wheat, rye, corn, and other grains are all harvested from flowering plants. Starchy foods, such as potatoes, and legumes, such as beans, are also angiosperms. And, as mentioned previously, fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase seed dispersal and are nutritious. There are also many non-food uses of angiosperms that are important to society. For example, cotton and other plants are used to make cloth, and hardwood trees are used for lumber.

Think about why the animal is behaving that way. These pictures show examples of animal behaviors. Why do the animals behave these ways? ", "Why do animals behave the way they do? The answer to this question depends on what the behavior is. A cat chases a mouse to catch it. A mother dog nurses her puppies to feed them. All of these behaviors have the same purpose: getting or providing food. All animals need food for energy. They need energy to move around. In fact, they need energy just to stay alive. Energy allows all the processes inside cells to occur. Baby animals also need energy to grow and develop. Birds and wasps build nests to have a safe place to store their eggs and raise their young. Many other animals build nests for the same reason. Animals protect their young in other ways, as well. For example, a mother dog not only nurses her puppies. She also washes them with her tongue and protects them from strange people or other animals. All of these behaviors help the young survive and grow up to be adults. Rabbits run away from foxes and other predators to stay alive. Their speed is their best defense. Lizards sun themselves on rocks to get warm because they cannot produce their own body heat. When they are warmer, they can move faster and be more alert. This helps them escape from predators and also find food. All of these animal behaviors are important. They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection.

Like human beings, many other animals live together in groups. Some insects, including ants and bees, are well known for living in groups. In order for animals to live together in groups, they must be able to communicate with each other. Animal communication, like most other animal behaviors, increases the ability to survive and have offspring. This is known as fitness. Communication increases fitness by helping animals find food, defend themselves from predators, mate, and care for offspring. ", "Some animals communicate with sound. Most birds communicate this way. Birds use different calls to warn other birds of danger, or to tell them to flock together. Many other animals also use sound to communicate. For example, monkeys use warning cries to tell other monkeys in their troop that a predator is near. Frogs croak to attract female frogs as mates. Gibbons use calls to tell other gibbons to stay away from their area. ", "Another way some animals communicate is with sight. By moving in certain ways or by making faces, they show other animals what they mean. Most primates communicate in this way. For example, a male chimpanzee may raise his arms and stare at another male chimpanzee. This warns the other chimpanzee to keep his distance. The chimpanzee pictured below may look like he is smiling, but he is really showing fear . He is communicating to other chimpanzees that he will not challenge them. Look at the peacock pictured below . Why is he raising his beautiful tail feathers? He is also communicating. He is showing females of his species that he would be a good mate. This peacock is using his tail feathers to communicate. What is he \"saying\"? ", "Some animals communicate with scent. They release chemicals that other animals of their species can smell or detect in some other way. Ants release many different chemicals. Other ants detect the chemicals with their antennae. This explains how ants are able to work together. The different chemicals that ants produce have different meanings. Some of the chemicals signal to all of the ants in a group to come together. Other chemicals warn of danger. Still other chemicals mark trails to food sources. When an ant finds food, it marks the trail back to the nest by leaving behind a chemical on the ground. Other ants follow the chemical trail to the food. Many other animals also use chemicals to communicate. You have probably seen male dogs raise their leg to urinate on a fire hydrant or other object. Did you know that the dogs were communicating? They mark their area with a chemical in their urine. Other dogs can smell the chemical. The scent of the chemical tells other dogs to stay away. ", "Like other animals, humans communicate with one another. They mainly use sound and sight to share information. The most important way in which humans communicate is with language. Language is the use of symbols to communicate. In human languages, the symbols are words. They stand for many different things. Words stand for things, people, actions, feelings, or ideas. Think of several common words. What does each word stand for? Another important way in which humans communicate is with facial expressions. Look at the face of the young child pictured below . Can you tell from her face how she is feeling? Humans also use gestures to communicate. What are people communicating when they shrug their shoulders? When they shake their head? These are just a few examples of the ways in which humans share information without using words. What does this girls face say about how she is feeling?

Below are the four most familiar subgroups, with a description of each ( Table 1.1). Subgroup Representative Organisms Approximate Number of Species Characteristics Subgroup Araneae Representative Organisms Spiders Approximate Number of Species 40,000 Characteristics Found all over the world, ranging from tropics to the Arctic, some in extreme environments. All produce silk, which is used for trapping insects in webs, aiding in climbing, producing egg sacs, and wrapping prey. Nearly all spiders inject venom to protect themselves or to kill prey. Only about 200 species have bites that can be harmful to humans. Subgroup Opiliones Representative Organisms Daddy-long-legs Approximate Number of Species 6,300 Characteristics Known for extremely long walking legs. No silk nor poison glands. Many are omnivores, eating small insects, plant material, and fungi. Some are scavengers, eating decaying animal and other matter. Mostly nocturnal (come out at night) and colored in hues of brown. A number of diurnal (come out during the day) species have vivid patterns of yellow, green, and black. Subgroup Scorpiones Representative Organisms Scorpions Approximate Number of Species 2,000 Characteristics Characterized by a tail with six segments, the last bearing a pair of venom glands and a venom-injecting barb. Predators of small arthropods and insects. They use pincers to catch prey. Then they either crush it or inject it with a fast-acting venom, which is used to kill or paralyze the prey. Only a few species are harmful to humans. Nocturnal; during the day, they find shelter in holes or under rocks. Unlike the majority of arachnids, scorpions produce live young. The young are carried about on the mothers back until they have molted at least once. They reach an age of between four to 25 years. Subgroup Acarina Representative Organisms Mites and ticks Approximate Number of Species 30,000 Characteristics Most are small (no more than 1.0 mm in length), but some ticks, and one species of mite, may grow to be 10-20 mm in length. Live in nearly ev- ery habitat, includ- ing aquatic and ter- restrial. Many are parasitic, affecting both in- vertebrates and ver- tebrates. They may transmit diseases to humans and other mammals.

Arthropods are a very diverse group of animals. In fact, they are the biggest group of animals on the planet, with upwards of 5 million distinct species. ", "Arthropods belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which means jointed feet, and includes four living subphyla. Chelicerata, which includes spiders , mites, and scorpions. In these animals, the first pair of appendages are often modified as fangs or pincers, and are used to manipulate food. Spiders have eight legs. Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes. All of these animals live on land, and can have anywhere from ten to nearly 200 pairs of appendages. Hexapoda, which includes the insects. These animals dominate the land. All hexapods have three pairs (six appendages) of walking appendages. Crustacea, which includes lobsters, crabs, barnacles, crayfish, and shrimp. These animals dominate the ocean, and usually have a set of anterior appendages that are modified as mandibles, which function in grasping, biting, and chewing food. Spiders are one type of arthropod. ", "Characteristics of arthropods include: 1. A segmented body  with a head, a thorax, and abdomen segments. 2. Appendages on at least one segment. They can be used for feeding, sensory reception, defense, and locomo- tion. In addition to legs, antennas and mouth parts are considered modified appendages. 3. A nervous system. 4. A hard exoskeleton made of chitin, which gives them physical protection and resistance to drying out. In order to grow, arthropods shed this outer covering in a process called molting. 5. An open circulatory system with hemolymph, a blood-like fluid. A series of hearts move the hemolymph into the body cavity where it comes in direct contact with the tissues. Hemolymph is involved with oxygen distribution. 6. A complete digestive system with a mouth and an anus. 7. Aquatic arthropods use gills to exchange gases. These gills have a large surface area in contact with the water, so they can absorb more oxygen. 8. Land-living arthropods have internal surfaces that help exchange gasses. Insects and most other terrestrial species have a tracheal system, where air sacs lead into the body from pores in the exoskeleton. These pores cover a large part of their external body surface. Others use book lungs, gills modified for breathing air, as seen in species like the coconut crab. Some areas of the legs of soldier crabs are covered with an oxygen absorbing skin. Land crabs sometimes have two different structures: one used for breathing underwater, and another used to absorb oxygen from the air.

The knowledge obtained through the study of the subspecialties of the life sciences is mostly basic science. Basic science is the source of most scientific theories. For example, a scientist that tries to figure out how the body makes cholesterol, or what causes a particular disease, is performing basic science. This is also known as basic research. Additional examples of basic research would be investigating how glucose is turned into cellular energy or determining how elevated blood glucose levels can be harmful. The study of the cell (cell biology), the study of inheritance (genetics), the study of molecules (molecular biology), the study of microorganisms and viruses (microbiology and virology), the study of tissues and organs (physiology) are all types of basic research, and have all generated lots of information that is applied to humans and human health. Applied science is using scientific discoveries, such as those from basic research, to solve practical problems. For example, medicine, and all that is known about how to treat patients, is applied science based on basic research . A doctor administering a drug to lower a persons cholesterol is an example of applied science. Applied science also creates new technologies based on basic science.

We know that chickens lay eggs. But how do they do that? It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate. In birds, this will involve a type of display, usually performed by the male. Some displays are very elaborate and may include dancing, aerial flights, or wing or tail drumming. Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females. If they are successful at attracting a female, it will lead to breeding. Birds reproduce by internal fertilization, during which the egg is fertilized inside the female. Like reptiles, birds have cloaca, or a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste. The male brings his sperm to the female cloaca. The sperm fertilizes the egg. Then the hard-shelled egg develops within the female. The hard-shelled eggs have a fluid-filled amnion, a thin membrane forming a closed sac around the embryo. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. ", "Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors? Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs . This gives the eggs protection against predation. Some species, like ground-nesting nightjars, have pale eggs, but the birds camouflage the eggs with their feathers. To protect their young, different species of birds make different nests. Birds of all types, from hummingbirds to ostriches, make nests. Many can be elaborate, shaped like cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows. However, some birds, like the common guillemot, do not use nests. Instead, they lay their eggs on bare cliffs. Emperor penguins do not have a nest at all; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they hatch, a process called incubation. How else might a bird help protect its young from predators? Most species locate their nests in areas that are hidden, in order to avoid predators. Large birds, or those that nest in groups, may build nests in the open, since they are more capable of defending their young. Nest and eggs of the common moorhen, showing camouflaged eggs. ", "In birds, 90% to 95% of species are monogamous, meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one mate dies. Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are monogamous. Usually, the parents take turns incubating the eggs. Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid. In polygamous species, where there is more than one mate, one parent does all of the incubating. The wild turkey is an example of a polygamous bird. The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different species of birds. At one extreme, in a group of birds called the magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at hatching. In this case, the newly- hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away. These birds are called precocial. Other precocial birds include the domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese. At the other extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of time. For example, the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive parental care for six months, or until they are ready to fly, and then take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents . These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called altricial. In most animals, male parental care is rare. But it is very common in birds. Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks. Since birds often take great care of their young, some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism. This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in another birds nest. The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite birds eggs. Great Frigatebird adults are known to care for their young for up to 20 months after hatching, the longest in a bird species. Here, a young bird is begging for food.

Robins, ostriches, hummingbirds, chickens, and eagles. All of these are birds, but they are very different from one another. There is an amazingly wide variety of birds. Like amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and fish, birds are vertebrates. What does that mean? It means they have a backbone. Almost all birds have forelimbs modified as wings, but not all birds can fly. In some birds, the wings have evolved into other structures. Birds are in the class Aves. All birds have the following key features: they are endothermic (warm-blooded), have two legs, and lay eggs. Birds range in size from the tiny two-inch bee hummingbird to the nine-foot ostrich . With approxi- mately 10,000 living species, birds are the most numerous vertebrates with four limbs. They live in diverse habitats around the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. The ostrich can reach a height of nine feet! Pictured here is an ostrich with her young in the Negev Desert, southern Israel. ", "The digestive system of birds is unique, with a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food. Birds do not have teeth. What do you think the stones do? They help them digest their food. Defining characteristics of modern birds also include: Feathers. High metabolism. A four-chambered heart. A beak with no teeth. A lightweight but strong skeleton. Production of hard-shelled eggs. Which of the above traits do you think might be of importance to flight? ", "In comparing birds with other vertebrates, what do you think distinguishes them the most? In most birds, flight is the obvious difference. Birds have adapted their body plan for flight: Their skeleton is especially lightweight, with large, air-filled spaces connecting to their respiratory system. Their neck bones are flexible. Birds that fly have a bony ridge along the breastbone that the flight muscles attach to . This allows them to remain stable in the air as they fly. Birds also have wings that function as an aerofoil. The surface of the aerofoil is curved to help the bird control and use the air currents to fly. Aerofoils are also found on the wings of airplanes. A bony ridge along the breastbone (green) allows birds to remain stable as they fly. What other traits do you think might be important for flight? Feathers help because theyre more lightweight than scales or fur. A birds wing shape and size will determine how a species flies. For example, many birds have powered flight at certain times, requiring the flapping of their wings, while at other times they soar, using up less energy . One birds flight. A flightless cormorant can no longer fly, but it uses its wings for swimming.

One measure of the health of your cardiovascular system is blood pressure. Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels. Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart, the walls of the arteries move in a rhythmic fashion. Blood in arteries is under the greatest amount of pressure. The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels. Blood in veins is not under much pressure. ", "Blood pressure is read as two numbers. The first number is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart beats. This is the time when there is the highest pressure in the arteries. The diastolic pressure, which is the second number, is when your blood pressure is lowest, when the heart is resting between beats. Healthy ranges for blood pressure are: Systolic: less than 120 Diastolic: less than 80 Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic. For example, a reading of 120/80 is said as \"one twenty over eighty.\" These measures of blood pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day. Pressure varies with exercise, emotions, sleep, stress, nutrition, drugs, or disease. Studies have shown that people whose systolic pressure is around 115, rather than 120, have fewer health problems. Clinical trials have shown that people who have blood pressures at the low end of these ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer . A digital sphygmomanometer is made of an inflatable cuff and a pressure meter to measure blood pressure. This reading shows a blood pressure of 126/70. Hypertension, which is also called \"high blood pressure,\" occurs when a persons blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a persons systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the persons diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a persons chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \"silent killer.\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. Some health conditions, as well as a persons lifestyle and genetic background, can put someone at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure. As a person cannot alter their genetic background, lifestyle changes may be necessary to reduce the chance of developing high blood pressure. These changes include getting enough exercise, limiting the amount of sodium (salt) in the diet, not being overweight, not drinking alcohol to excess, and not smoking. Low blood pressure is not usually a concern, as long as there are no problems associated with the low pressure. Symptoms associated with low blood pressure include dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting, dehydration and unusual thirst, lack of concentration, blurred vision, nausea, and fatigue.

The chordate phylum is broken down into three subphyla: 1. Urochordata: The tunicates, pictured in the introduction, make up this group. The urochordates are sessile (non-moving) marine animals with sack-like bodies and tubes for water movement. Urochordates have a notochord and nerve cord only during the larval stage. 2. Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates include the lancelets , fish-like marine animals often found half-buried in the sand. Cephalochordates have a notochord and nerve cord but no backbone. 3. Vertebrata: Humans and other mammals, along with fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds, fall in this category. In vertebrates, the notochord is typically smaller and surrounded by a backbone. The lancelet, an example of a chordate, is found in shallow ocean waters.

Cnidarians use nematocysts to catch their food. When touched, the nematocysts release a thread of poison that can be used to paralyze prey. Cnidarians are among the simplest of the so-called \"higher\" organisms, but are also among the most beautiful. ", "The body plan of cnidarians is unique because these organisms show radial symmetry, making these animals very different from those that evolved before them. Radial symmetry means that they have a circular body plan, and any cut through the center of the animal leaves two equal halves. The cnidarians have two basic body forms: 1. Polyp: The polyp is a cup-shaped body with the mouth facing upward, such as a sea anemone and coral. 2. Medusa: The medusa is a bell-shaped body with the mouth and tentacles facing downward, such as a jellyfish. Unlike the sponges which evolved prior to cnidarians, the cnidarians are made up of true tissues. The inside of a cnidarian is called the gastrovascular cavity, a large space that helps the organism digest and move nutrients around the body. The cnidarians also have nerve tissue organized into a net-like structure, known as a nerve-net, with connected nerve cells dispersed throughout the body. Cnidarians do not have true organs, however. Reproduction is by asexual budding (polyps) or sexual formation of gametes (medusae, some polyps). The result of sexual reproduction is a larva, which can swim on its own. ", "Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies. Two examples are described below. 1. The Portuguese Man o War  looks like a single organism but is actually a colony of polyps. One polyp is filled with air to help the colony float, while several feeding polyps hang below with tentacles. The tentacles are full of nematocysts. The Portuguese Man o War is known to cause extremely painful stings to swimmers and surfers who accidentally brush up against it in the water. 2. Coral reefs  look like big rocks, but they are actually alive. They are built from cnidarians called corals. The corals are sessile (non-moving) polyps that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures that pass by. Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate, which is also known as limestone. Over long periods of time, their skeletons build on each other to produce large structures known as coral reefs. Coral reefs are important habitats for many different types of ocean life. Corals are colonial cnidarians.

But how do organisms interact with each other? Organisms interact with each other through various mechanisms, one of which is competition. Competition occurs when organisms strive for limited resources. Competition can be for food, water, light, or space. This interaction can be between organisms of the same species (intraspecific) or between organisms of different species (interspecific). Intraspecific competition happens when members of the same species compete for the same resources. For example, two trees may grow close together and compete for light. One may out-compete the other by growing taller to get more available light. As members of the same species are usually genetically different, they have different characteristics, and in this example, one tree grows taller than the other. The organism that is better adapted to that environment is better able to survive. The other organism may not survive. In this example, it is the taller tree that is better adapted to the environment. Interspecific competition happens when individuals of different species strive for a limited resource in the same area. Since any two species have different traits, one species will be able to out-compete the other. One species will be better adapted to its environment, and essentially \"win\" the competition. The other species will have lower reproductive success and lower population growth, resulting in a lower survival rate. For example, cheetahs and lions feed on similar prey. If prey is limited, then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs. This will force the cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in population. Looking at different types of competition, ecologists developed the competitive exclusion principle. The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt, move from the area, or die out. In order for two species within the same area to coexist, they may adapt by developing different specializations. This is known as character displacement. An example of character displacement is when different birds adapt to eating different types of food. They can develop different types of bills, like Darwins Finches . Therefore, competition for resources within and between species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection. An example of character displacement, showing different types of bill for eating different types of foods, in Darwins or Galapagos Finches.

All animals are consumers, and they eat other organisms. Fungi and many protists and bacteria are also consumers. But, whereas animals eat other organisms, fungi, protists, and bacteria \"consume\" organisms through different methods. The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what they consume. Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy. For example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants. The caterpillar pictured below  is a herbivore. Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments are also herbivores. Carnivores feed on animals, either herbivores or other carnivores. Snakes that eat mice are carnivores. Hawks that eat snakes are also carnivores . Omnivores eat both producers and consumers. Most people are omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables, and grains from plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals. Dogs, bears, and raccoons are also omnivores. Examples of consumers are caterpillars (herbivores) and hawks (carnivore). ", "Decomposers  get nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes. Through this process, decomposers release nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, back into the environment. These nutrients are recycled back into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them. They are passed to other organisms when they are eaten or consumed. Many of these nutrients are recycled back into the soil, so they can be taken up by the roots of plants. The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of the decomposers. Examples of decomposers include mushrooms on a decaying log. Bacteria in the soil are also decomposers. Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers. Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up and the nutrients within the waste and dead organisms would not be released back into the ecosystem. Producers would not have enough nutrients. The carbon and nitrogen necessary to build organic compounds, and then cells, allowing an organism to grow, would be insufficient. Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would also not be sufficient. Essentially, many organisms could not exist. Examples of decomposers are (a) bacte- ria and (b) fungi.

Most utilize insect-killing chemicals, but more and more rely on other methods. Ways to control insect pests are described below. ", "Biological control of pests in farming is a method of controlling pests by using other insects (or other natural predators of the pests). Biological control of insects relies on predation and parasitism. Insect predators, such as ladybugs and lacewings, consume a large number of other insects during their lifetime. If you add ladybugs to your farm or garden, they will help keep insect pests, such as aphids, under control. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions, so any control of these pests is beneficial. Ladybugs also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The larvae of many hoverfly species also feed upon aphids, with one larva consuming up to fifty aphids a day, which is about 1,000 in its lifetime. They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars. Dragonflies are important predators of mosquitoes, and can be used to control this pest. Parasitic insects include insects such as wasps and flies that lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Caterpillars also tend to be one likely target of parasitic wasps. ", "Chemical control of pests involves the use of insecticides. Insecticides, which are also known as pesticides, are most often used to kill insects. Insecticides are chemicals that kill insects. The U.S. spends $9 billion each year on pesticides. Disadvantages to using pesticides include human, fish, and honeybee poisonings, and the contamination of meat and dairy products. When choosing to use an insecticide, there are numerous points to consider. Negative effects of the pesticide should try to be minimized. Important questions to consider include the following. What is the chemicals success against the target pest? Will the insecticide provide the desired level of control of the pest? If the answer is no, other methods of control should be considered. Does the chemical have an impact on natural enemies of the pest? In large scale efforts to rid areas of mosquitoes, the insecticide used also killed the dragonfly. This effort removed a natural predator of the mosquito. This may be an unacceptable negative effect of using the insecticide. How susceptible is the crop to insect damage? If the crop is not heavily damaged, only minor pest control may be needed. This may affect the amount or type of insecticide used. How toxic is the chemical to the environment and humans? Some older insecticides are extremely poisonous. Keep in mind that users of these poisons have a community responsibility to minimize the contamination of the surrounding environment, as well as keeping animals, surrounding crops and humans safe. Does using the pesticide result in the development of resistance? If so, this can make additional use of the pesticide less effective. As the resistance will be passed to future generations of the insect (which is natural selection in action), this could be considered a negative side-effect of pesticide use.

Crustaceans are among the most successful animals, and can be considered the dominant aquatic animals. Though small, crustaceans are numerous enough to be the main source of energy for large ocean mammals. They are found as much in the oceans as insects are on land.

An exoskeleton that may be bound together, such as in the carapace, the thick back shield seen in many crustaceans that often forms a protective space for the gills. 2. A main body cavity with an expanded circulatory system. Blood is pumped by a heart located near the back. 3. A digestive system consisting of a straight tube that has a gastric mill for grinding food and a pair of digestive glands that absorb food. 4. Structures that function like kidneys to remove wastes. These are located near the antennae. 5. A brain that exists in the form of ganglia, or connections between nerve cells. 6. Crustaceans periodically shed the outer skeleton, grow rapidly for a short time, and then form another hard skeleton. They cannot grow underneath their outer exoskeleton. They are very vulnerable during this time, as they lack their hard shell. ", "Most crustaceans have separate sexes, so they reproduce sexually using eggs and sperm. Many land crustaceans, such as the Christmas Island red crab, mate every season and return to the sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, lay their eggs on land when the environment is damp. In some crustaceans, the females keep the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.

They go through cycles. Some cycles of behavior repeat each year. Other cycles of behavior repeat every day. ", "An example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is hibernation. Hibernation is a state in which an animals body processes are slower than usual, and its body temperature falls. An animal uses less energy than usual during hibernation. This helps the animal survive during a time of year when food is scarce. Hibernation may last for weeks or months. Animals that hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and snakes. Most people think that bears hibernate. In fact, bears do not go into true hibernation. In the winter, they go into a deep sleep. However, their body processes do not slow down very much. Their body temperature also remains about the same as usual. Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep. Another example of a behavior with a yearly cycle is migration. Migration is the movement of animals from one place to another. Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the environment. For example, animals may migrate when the days get shorter in the fall. Migration is most common in birds, fish, and insects. In the Northern Hemisphere, many species of birds, including robins and geese, travel south for the winter. They migrate to areas where it is warmer and where there is more food. They return north in the spring. A flock of migrating geese is pictured below . These geese are flying south for the win- ter. Flocks of geese migrate in V-shaped formations. Some animals migrate very long distances. The map shown below shows the migration route of a species of hawk called Swainsons hawk . About how many miles do the hawks travel from start to finish? Are you surprised that birds migrate that far? Some species of birds migrate even farther. Whales also are known to migrate thousands of miles each year to take advantage of warmer waters in the winter months. The great migration of millions of zebra, wildebeest and other antelope in East Africa also occurs yearly. Each year around 1.5 million wildebeest and 300,000 zebra (along with other antelope) go in search of food and water, traveling a distance of around 1800 miles. Birds and other migrating animals follow the same routes each year. How do they know where to go? It depends on the species. Some animals follow landmarks, such as rivers or coastlines. Other animals are guided by the position of the sun, the usual direction of the wind, or other clues in the environment. ", "Many animal behaviors change at certain times of day, day after day. For example, most animals go to sleep when the sun sets and wake up when the sun rises. Animals that are active during the daytime are called diurnal. Some animals do the opposite. They sleep all day and are active during the night. These animals are called nocturnal. Examples of nocturnal animals include bats, foxes, possums, skunks and coyotes. Many mammals (including humans), insects, reptiles and birds are diurnal. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock. This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. The migration route of Swainsons hawk starts in North America and ends in South America. Scientists learned their mi- gration route by attaching tiny tracking devices to the birds. The birds were then tracked by satellite. On the migra- tion south, the hawks travel almost 5,000 miles from start to finish.

About 10,000 bird species belong to 29 different orders within the class Aves. They live and breed on all seven continents. The tropics are home to the greatest biodiversity of birds. The diversity among birds is striking. Birds can vary greatly in size and color. Some fly, some swim, some just walk or run. Some are savage carnivores, others are gentle herbivores. Some are low on the food chain, others are at the top. Birds live in a variety of different habitats. Birds that live in different habitats will encounter different foods and different predators. Birds can be carnivores (feeding on other animals), herbivores (feeding on plants), or generalists (feeding on a variety of foods). The lifestyle of the bird can affect what it looks like. For example, can you think of some examples of beaks that are adapted to the type of food a bird eats? Carnivorous birds include hawks, falcons, eagles, osprey, vultures and owls. Herbivorous birds include the goose, cockatoo and parrot. The American Crow is an example of a generalist. In addition, a specialist is a bird (or other animal) that is specially adapted to eat a certain food. An example of a specialist is a hummingbird, whose long, thin beak is excellent for reaching into flowers for nectar, but not very good for eating other foods. Waterfowl are birds that live on the water. These include ducks, geese, swans, and pelicans, to name a few. Landfowl are ground-feeding birds such as chickens and turkeys. Penguins are a group of flightless birds adapted for life in the water with flippers. Diurnal raptors are birds of prey that hunt during the day. These include falcons, eagles and hawks. Nocturnal raptors hunt during the night. These include various types of owls. Parrots are brightly colored and very intelligent.

Parrots have down-curved, hooked bills, which are well-adapted for cracking seeds and nuts . Hummingbirds, on the other hand, have long, thin, pointed bills, which are adapted for getting the nectar out of flowers . Hawks, eagles, falcons and owls have a sharp, hooked beak.

Some birds, such as gulls and terns and other waterfowl, have webbed feet used for swimming or floating . Other birds, such as herons, gallinules, and rails, have four long spreading toes, which are adapted for walking delicately in the wetlands . You can predict how the beaks and feet of birds will look depending on where they live and what type of food they eat. Flightless birds also have long legs that are adapted for running. Flightless birds include the ostrich and kiwi. Raptors have clawed feet. They also have strong legs. Hawks, eagles and falcons also have excellent vision and they hunt by sight. Owls, with excellent hearing, can hunt by that sense alone. See Wild African Vulture Birds Scavage Bones of Dead Animals at  (left) The webbed feet of a great black- backed gull.

That is, ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with the nonliving part of their environment. An ecosystem consists of all the nonliving factors and living organisms interacting in the same habitat. Recall that living organisms are biotic factors. The biotic factors of an ecosystem include all the populations in a habitat, such as all the species of plants, animals, and fungi, as well as all the micro-organisms. Also recall that the nonliving factors are called abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include temperature, water, soil, and air. You can find an ecosystem in a large body of fresh water or in a small aquarium. You can find an ecosystem in a large thriving forest or in a small piece of dead wood. Examples of ecosystems are as diverse as the rainforest, the savanna, the tundra, or the desert . The differences in the abiotic factors, such as differences in temperature, rainfall, and soil quality, found in these areas greatly contribute to the differences seen in these ecosystems. Ecosystems can include well known sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park, which actually includes a few different ecosystems, some with geothermal features, such as Old Faithful geyser. Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, Ari- zona. Ecosystems need energy. Many ecosystems get their energy in the form of sunlight, which enters the ecosystem through photosynthesis. This energy then flows through the ecosystem, passed from producers to consumers. Plants are producers in many ecosystems. Energy flows from plants to the herbivores that eat the plants, and then to carnivores that eat the herbivores. The flow of energy depicts interactions of organisms within an ecosystem. Matter is also recycled in ecosystems. Biogeochemical cycles recycle nutrients, like carbon and nitrogen, so they are always available. These nutrients are used over and over again by organisms. Water is also continuously recycled. The flow of energy and the recycling of nutrients and water are examples of the interactions between organisms and the interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem.

What exactly does this mean? Essentially, it means that organisms must eat other organisms. Food chains  show the eating patterns in an ecosystem. Food energy flows from one organism to another. Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the animals. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it. For example, an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves. Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper. Next, a bird might prey on the grasshopper, a snake may eat the bird, and then an owl might eat the snake. The food chain would be: plant  grasshopper  bird  snake  owl. A food chain cannot continue to go on and on. For example the food chain could not be: plant  grasshopper  spider  frog  lizard  fox  hawk. Food chains only have 4 or 5 total levels. Therefore, a chain has only 3 or 4 levels for energy transfer. This food chain includes producers and consumers. How could you add decom- posers to the food chain? In an ocean ecosystem, one possible food chain might look like this: phytoplankton  krill  fish  shark. The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain, bringing energy into the ecosystem. Through photosynthesis, the producers create their own food in the form of glucose, but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem. The herbivores come next, then the carnivores. When these consumers eat other organisms, they use the glucose in those organisms for energy. In this example, phytoplankton are eaten by krill, which are tiny, shrimp-like animals. The krill are eaten by fish, which are then eaten by sharks. Could decomposers be added to a food chain? Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms, so simple food chains are rare in nature. There are also many different species of fish and sharks. So a food chain cannot end with a shark; it must end with a distinct species of shark. A food chain does not contain the general category of \"fish,\" it will contain specific species of fish. In ecosystems, there are many food chains. Since feeding relationships are so complicated, we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem. A food web  shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem. If you expand our original example of a food chain, you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks. A food web shows many more arrows, but still shows the flow of energy. A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships. For more information on food chains, see A Million Sharks at  .

In terms of classification, there is actually not a big difference between frogs and toads. Frogs often have long legs that are good for hopping, skin that is smooth and moist, and special pads on their toes that help them climb. Toads are more heavyset with shorter legs, and usually have drier skin, often with warty-looking bumps. Frogs are more likely to live in or near water than toads. Frogs are found in many areas of the world, from the tropics to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests. Consisting of more than 5,000 species (about 88% of amphibian species are frogs), they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Frogs range in size from less than 0.5 inches in species in Brazil and Cuba to the over 1-foot (33 cm) long goliath frog of Cameroon, which can weigh up to 7 pounds. That is 1-foot from the nose to the back of the body, not including the length of the legs. Even the largest frogs are significantly smaller than common reptiles. ", "Adult frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed finger-like parts, and the lack of a tail. They also have a three-chambered heart, as do all tetrapods except birds and mammals. Most frogs live part of the time in water and part of the time on land. They move easily on land by jumping or climbing. To become great jumpers, frogs evolved long hind legs and long ankle bones. They also have a short backbone with only ten vertebrae. Frog and toad skin hangs loosely on the body, and skin texture can be smooth, warty, or folded. Frogs and toads dont have fur, feathers, or scales on their skin. Instead, they have a moist and permeable skin layer covered with mucous glands. Their special skin allows them to breathe through their skin in addition to using their lungs. They are vulnerable to water loss through the skin in dry conditions, which is why they need to live near water or in moist environments. The thin layer of mucous keeps the skin moist. In order to live on land and in water, frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is see-through to protect the eyes underwater, and the two other ones let them see on land. Frogs also have a tympanum, which acts like a simple ear. They are found on each side of the head. In some species, the tympanum is covered by skin. A tree frog. Notice the powerful muscles in the limbs and the coverings around the eyes. ", "Frogs typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds, or lakes. Their larvae, or tadpoles, have gills, a tail, but no legs, and need to live in water. If fact, they are quite similar to a fish. Tadpoles develop into adult frogs in water ( Figure You may hear males \"ribbiting,\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. ", "Adult frogs are meat-eaters and eat mostly insects, spiders, slugs and worms. Larger species will eat mice, birds, and even other small reptiles and amphibians. Frogs do not have teeth on their lower jaw, so they usually swallow their food whole. Some frogs have teeth on the upper jaw that are used to hold the prey in place. Frogs and toads are responsible for keeping a large part of the worlds insect population under control. They catch these insects using their long tongue. The frog tongue is about a third the length of the frogs body, though they can Frogs develop from tadpoles, which de- velop from eggs. Notice the formation of the two powerful back legs used for jumping. grow even longer. They can easily reach 12 inches long in an adult frog. Frogs tongues are attached to the front of their mouths rather than at the back like humans. They release a sticky substance at the precise moment of impact with their food. When a frog catches an insect it throws its sticky tongue out of its mouth and wraps it around its prey. The frogs tongue then snaps back and throws the food down its throat. This happens about as fast as a blink of your eyes.

Scientists used to debate about which kingdom to place fungi in. Finally they decided that fungi were plants. But they were wrong. Now, scientists know that fungi are not plants at all. Fungi are very different from plants. The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy. Plants are autotrophs, meaning that they make their own \"food\" using the energy from sunlight. Fungi are heterotrophs, which means that they obtain their \"food\" from outside of themselves. In other words, they must \"eat\" their food like animals do. But they dont really eat. Instead, they absorb their nutrients. Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are all different kinds of fungi. There may be as many as 1.5 million species of fungi . You can easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope, but most fungi you cannot see.

Surface area is how much exposed area an organism has, compared to their overall volume. Most of a mushrooms surface area is actually underground. If you see a mushroom in your yard, that is just a small part of a larger fungus growing underground. These are the steps involved in fungi \"eating\": 1. Fungi squirt special enzymes into their environment. 2. The enzymes help digest large organic molecules, similar to cutting up your food before you eat. 3.

Many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. However, some reproduce only sexually and some only asexually. Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual repro- duction involves two parents. ", "Through asexual reproduction, new organisms are produced that are genetically identical to the parent. That is, they have exactly the same DNA. Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods: 1. Spores: Spores are formed by the fungi and released to create new fungi. This is the powdery substance released by puffballs. Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria, plants, algae, fungi, and protozoa. Theoretically, spores can reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring. Obviously this does not happen. If it did, the world would be covered by genetically identical fungi. 2. Budding: The fungus grows a new part of its body, which eventually breaks off. The broken-off piece becomes a new organism . 3. Fragmentation: In this method, a piece of the mycelium, the body of the fungus, splits off. The resulting fragment can eventually produce a new colony of fungi. Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction. This form of reproduction is controlled by many different factors. Outside conditions, such as the availability of food, determine when a fungus undergoes asexual reproduction. ", "Almost all fungi can reproduce sexually. But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker? Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents. This increases the genetic diversity of the species. In plants and animals, sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new individual. In fungi, however, two haploid hyphae meet together and their nuclei fuse. Instead of calling a hyphae male or female, they have different mating types, such as (+) and (-) . The common mushroom, a fruiting body, results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae, one (+) and one (-), mate, forming a mycelium with sporangia. No- tice, when the sporangia burst, the spores are released from the fruiting body.

Instead, the seeds of gymnosperms are usually found in cones. There are four phyla of gymnosperms: 1. Conifers 2. Cycads 3. Ginkgoes 4. Gnetophytes ", "Conifers, members of the phylum Coniferophyta, are probably the gymnosperms that are most familiar to you. Conifers include trees such as pines, firs, spruces, cedars, and the coastal redwood trees in California, which are the tallest living vascular plants. Conifers have their reproductive structures in cones, but they are not the only plants to have that trait . Conifer pollen cones are usually very small, while the seed cones are larger. Pollen contains gametophytes that produce the male gamete of seed plants. The pollen, which is a powder-like substance, is carried by the wind to fertilize the seed cones that contain the female gamete . Conifers have many uses. They are important sources of lumber and are also used to make paper. Resins, the sticky substance you might see oozing out of a wound on a pine tree, are collected from conifers to make a variety of products, such as the solvent turpentine and the rosin used by musicians and baseball players. The sticky rosin improves the pitchers hold on the ball or increases the friction between the bow and the strings to help create music from a violin or other stringed instrument. ", "Cycads, in the phylum Cycadophyta, are also gymnosperms. They have large, finely-divided leaves and grow as short shrubs and trees in tropical regions. Like conifers, they produce cones, but the seed cones and pollen cones are always on separate plants . One type of cycad, the Sago Palm, is a popular landscape plant. During the Age of the Dinosaurs (about 65 to 200 million years ago), cycads were the dominant plants. So you can imagine dinosaurs grazing on cycad seeds and roaming through cycad forests. The end of a pine tree branch bears the male cones that produce the pollen. Cycads bear their pollen and seeds in cones on separate plants. ", "Ginkgoes, in the phylum Ginkgophyta, are unique because they are the only species left in the phylum. Many other species in the fossil record have gone extinct . The ginkgo tree is sometimes called a \"living fossil\" because it is the last species from its phylum. One reason the ginkgo tree may have survived is because it was often grown around Buddhist temples, especially in China. The ginkgo tree is also a popular landscape tree today in American cities because it can live in polluted areas better than most plants. Ginkgoes, like cycads, has separate female and male plants. The male trees are usually preferred for landscaping because the seeds produced by the female plants smell terrible when they ripen. Ginkgo trees are gymnosperms with broad leaves. ", "Gnetophytes, in the phylum Gnetophyta, are a very small and unusual group of plants. Ephedra is an important member of this group, since this desert shrub produces the ephedrine used to treat asthma and other conditions. Welwitschia produces extremely long leaves and is found in the deserts of southwestern Africa . Overall, there are about 70 different species in this diverse phylum. One type of gnetophyte is Welwitschia.

A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem. In other words, a niche is how an organism makes a living. A niche will include the organisms role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem. This involves how the organism gets its energy, which usually has to do with what an organism eats, and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem, which has to do with what eats the organism. An organisms niche also includes how the organism interacts with other organisms, and its role in recycling nutrients. Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position. For example when the Tarpan, a small wild horse found mainly in southern Russia, became extinct in the early 1900s, its niche was filled by a small horse breed, the Konik . Often this occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche. A species niche must be specific to that species; no two species can fill the same niche. They can have very similar niches, which can overlap, but there must be distinct differences between any two niches. If two species do fill the same niche, they will compete for all necessary resources. One species will out compete the other, forcing the other species to adapt or risk extinction. This is known as competitive exclusion. When plants and animals are introduced, either intentionally or by accident, into a new environment, they can occupy the existing niches of native organisms. Sometimes new species out-compete native species, and the native species may go extinct. They can then become a serious pest. For example, kudzu, a Japanese vine, was planted in the southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss. Kudzu had no natural predators, so it was able to out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches . ", "The habitat is the physical area where a species lives. Many factors are used to describe a habitat. The average amount of sunlight received each day, the range of annual temperatures, and average yearly rainfall can all describe a habitat. These and other abiotic factors will affect the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive there. The temperature, the amount of rainfall, the type of soil and other abiotic factors all have a significant role in determining the plants that invade an area. The plants then determine the animals that come to eat the plants, and so on. A habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem: the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem, whereas the ecosystem includes both the biotic and abiotic factors in the habitat. Habitat destruction means what it sounds likean organisms habitat is destroyed. Habitat destruction can cause a population to decrease. If bad enough, it can also cause species to go extinct. Clearing large areas of land for housing developments or businesses can cause habitat destruction. Poor fire management, pest and weed invasion, and storm damage can also destroy habitats. National parks, nature reserves, and other protected areas all preserve habitats. Santa Cruz Island off the California coast has diverse habitats including a coastline with steep cliffs, coves, gigantic caves, and sandy beaches.

Your habitat can be altered, and you can easily adapt. Most people live in a few different places and go to a number of different schools throughout their life. But a plant or animal may not be able to adapt to a changed habitat. A habitat is the natural home or environment of an organism. Humans often destroy the habitats of other organisms. Habitat destruction can cause the extinction of species. Extinction is the complete disappearance of a species. Once a species is extinct, it can never recover. Some ways humans cause habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native species of plants and animals. ", "Clearing land for agriculture and development is a major cause of habitat destruction. Within the past 100 years, the amount of total land used for agriculture has almost doubled. Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled. Agriculture alone has cost the United States half of its wetlands  and almost all of its tallgrass prairies. Native prairie ecosystems, with their thick fertile soils, deep-rooted grasses, diversity of colorful flowers, burrowing prairie dogs, and herds of bison and other animals, have virtually disappeared . Wetlands such as this one in Cape May, New Jersey, filter water and protect coastal lands from storms and floods. The Flint Hills contain some of the largest remnants of tallgrass prairie habitat remaining in North America. ", "Other habitats that are being rapidly destroyed are forests, especially tropical rainforests. The largest cause of deforestation today is slash-and-burn agriculture (shown in the opening image). This means that when people want to turn a forest into a farm, they cut down all of the trees and then burn the remainder of the forest. This technique is used by over 200 million people in tropical forests throughout the world. As a consequence of slash-and-burn agriculture, nutrients are quickly lost from the soil. This often results in people abandoning the land within a few years. Then the top soil erodes and desertification can follow. Desertification Herds of bison also made up part of the tallgrass prairie community. turns forest into a desert, where it is difficult for plants to grow. Half of the Earths mature tropical forests are gone. At current rates of deforestation, all tropical forests will be gone by the year 2090. ", "One of the main causes of extinction is introduction of exotic species into an environment. These exotic and new species can also be called invasive species or non-native species. These non-native species, being new to an area, may not have natural predators in the new habitat, which allows their populations to easily adapt and grow. Invasive species out-compete the native species for resources. Sometimes invasive species are so successful at living in a certain habitat that the native species go extinct . Recently, cargo ships have transported zebra mussels, spiny waterfleas, and ruffe (a freshwater fish) into the Great Lakes . These invasive species are better at hunting for food. They have caused some of the native species to go extinct. Invasive species can disrupt food chains, carry disease, prey on native species directly, and out-compete native species for limited resources, like food. All of these effects can lead to extinction of the native species. ", "Other causes of habitat destruction include poor fire management, overfishing, mining , pollution, and storm damage. All of these can cause irreversible changes to a habitat and ecosystem. ", "A habitat that is quickly being destroyed is the wetland. By the 1980s, over 80% of all wetlands in parts of the U.S. were destroyed. In Europe, many wetland species have gone extinct. For example, many bogs in Scotland have been lost because of human development. Another example of species loss due to habitat destruction happened on Madagascars central highland plateau. From 1970 to 2000, slash-and-burn agriculture destroyed about 10% of the countrys total native plants. The area turned into a wasteland. Soil from erosion entered the waterways. Much of the river ecosystems of several large rivers were also destroyed. Several fish species are almost extinct. Also, some coral reef formations in the Indian Ocean are completely lost.

As soon as they open their eyes in the morning, they might look at the clock to see what time it is. Then, they might look out the window to see what the weather is like. They probably look in a mirror to comb their hair. In school, they use their eyes to read the board, their textbooks, and the expressions on their friends faces. After school, they might keep their eye on the ball while playing basketball . Then, they might read their homework assignment and text messages from their friends. Sight, or vision, is the ability to see light. It depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images. It also depends on the brain making sense of the images, so that we know what we are seeing. Human beings and other primates depend on vision more than many other animals. Its not surprising, then, that we have a better sense of vision than many other animals. Not only can we normally see both distant and close-up objects clearly, but we can also see in three dimensions and in color. But humans do not have the best vision. You may think you see things fairly clearly. Imagine if you could see even better. How about 8 times better? Raptors, or birds of prey, including the eagles, hawks and falcons can see up to 8 times more clearly than the sharpest human eye. A golden eagle for example can see a rabbit from a mile away. Why do you think they have such a good sense of vision? Other animals also have much better night vision then us. ", "Did you ever use 3-D glasses to watch a movie, like the boy pictured below ? If you did, then you know that the glasses make people and objects in the movie appear to jump out of the screen. They make images on the flat movie screen seem more realistic because they give them depth. Thats the difference between seeing things in two dimensions and three dimensions. We are able to see in three dimensions because we have two eyes facing the same direction but a few inches apart. As a result, we see objects and people with both eyes at the same time but from slightly different angles. Hold up a finger a few inches away from your face, and look at it, first with one eye and then with the other. Youll notice that your finger appears to move. Now hold up your finger at arms length, and look at it with one eye and then the other. Your finger seems to move less than it did when it was closer. Although you arent aware of it, your brain constantly uses such differences to determine the distance of objects. ", "For animals like us that see in color, it may be hard to imagine a world that appears to be mainly shades of gray. You can get an idea of how many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture of colorful objects. For example, look at the apple on the tree pictured below . In the top picture, they appear in color, the way you would normally see them. In the bottom picture they appear without color, in shades of gray . Humans with color vision see the apple on this tree; the bright red color of the apple stands out clearly from the green background of leaves. This black-and-white picture gives an idea of how many animals see the world. Dogs and cats would see the green and red colors as shades of gray; they are able to see blue, but red and green appear the same to them. Many animals see just one or two colors. Some see colors that we cannot see. Apes and chimps see the same colors as us. But whereas many animals cannot see colors, some animals see colors that we cannot. The range of color vision of bees and butterflies for example, extends beyond the visible spectrum of light we can see. The leaves of the flowers they pollinate have special ultraviolet patterns which guide the insects deep into the flower. ", "Why do you think primates, including humans, evolved the ability to see in three dimensions and in color? To answer that question, you need to know a little about primate evolution. Millions of years ago, primate ancestors lived in trees. To move about in the trees, they needed to be able to judge how far away the next branch was. Otherwise, they might have a dangerous fall. Being able see in depth was important. It was an adaptation that would help tree-living primates survive. Primate ancestors also mainly ate fruit. They needed to be able to spot colored fruits in the leafy background of the trees . They also had to be able to judge which fruits were ripe and which were still green. Ripe fruits are usually red, orange, yellow, or purple. Being able to see in color was important for finding food. It was an adaptation that would help fruit-eating primates survive.

The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the worlds flowering plants and about 35% of the worlds food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. Lobsters are one kind of arthropod food source. ", "Humans use mites to prey on unwanted arthropods on farms or in homes. Other arthropods are used to control weed growth. Populations of whip scorpions added to an environment can limit the populations of cockroaches and crickets. Millipedes also control the harmful growth of destructive fungi and bacteria. When the numbers of millipedes is low, the imbalance between predator and prey can cause harmful microorganisms to flourish, and it can became difficult to manage plagues and diseases through natural processes. Cockroaches, spiders, mites, ticks and all other insects considered as carnivorous, prey on smaller species to maintain ecological balance. Thus, communities that have a good balance of these arthropods tend to have better pest control. ", "Many arthropods have extremely important roles in ecosystems. Arthropods are of ecological importance because of their sheer numbers and extreme diversity. As mentioned above, bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles are invaluable agents of pollination. Pollens and grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs and are transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about, either by walking or flying. Most plants actually produce scents to send signals to insects that food (in the form of nectar) is available. Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are decomposers, meaning they break down dead plants and animals and turn them into soil nutrients. This is an important role because it supplies the plants with the minerals and nutrients necessary for life. It also keeps dead material from accumulating in the environment. Plants then pass along those minerals and nutrients to the animals that eat the plants. ", "Arthropods are also invaluable to humans, as they are used in many different human-made products. Examples are: Bees produce honey and their honeycombs contain beeswax, widely used for making candles, furniture wax and polishes, waxed papers, antiseptics, and fillings for surgical uses. The pollens stored in honeycombs were discovered to have a rich mixture of vitamins, enzymes, and amino acids that could provide medical benefits. They were used as ingredients for supplements and medications that could provide relief for colds, asthma, and hay fever. Silk produced by arthropods, like those produced by caterpillars to protect their cocoons, is strong enough to use and be woven into fabrics, a discovery first used in ancient Chinas silk industry. The spiders web was discovered as an additional material that could provide strength, and has became essential raw materials for Kevlar vests, fishing nets, surgical sutures, and adhesives, as they contained natural antiseptics.

More specifically, biodi- versity can be defined as the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur. A place such as a coral reef has many different species of plants and animals. That means the coral reef is a ecosystem with high biodiversity . Because of its biodiversity, the rainforest shown above is an ecosystem with extreme importance. Why is biodiversity so important? In addition to maintaining the health and stability of the ecosystem, the diversity of life provides us with many benefits. Extinction is a threat to biodiversity. Does it matter if we are losing thousands of species each year? The answer is yes. It matters even if we consider not only the direct benefits to humans, but also the benefits to the ecosystems. The health and survival of ecosystems is related to that ecosystems biodiversity. Coral reefs are one of the biomes with the highest biodiversity on Earth. ", "Economically, there are many direct benefits of biodiversity. As many as 40,000 species of fungi, plants, and animals provide us with many varied types of clothing, shelter, medicines and other products. These include poisons, timber, fibers, fragrances, papers, silks, dyes, adhesives, rubber, resins, skins, furs, and more. According to one survey, 57% of the most important prescription drugs come from nature. Specifically, they come from bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals . But only a small amount of species with the ability to give us medicines have been explored. The loss of any species may mean the loss of new medicines, which will have a direct effect on human health. Aspirin originally came from the bark of the white willow tree, pictured here. ", "Nature has inspired many technologies in use today. Bionics, also known as biomimetics or biomimicry, uses organisms to inspire technology or engineering projects. By studying animals and their traits, we are able to gain valuable information that we can put to use to help us. For example, rattlesnake heat-sensing pits helped inspire the development of infrared sensors. Zimbabwes Eastgate Centre  was inspired by the air-conditioning efficiency of a termite mound . Design of the Eastgate Centre (brown building), in Zimbabwe, which requires just 10% of the energy needed for a con- ventional building of the same size, was inspired by a biological design. ", "Biodiversity also has many benefits to ecosystems. High biodiversity makes ecosystems more stable. What can happen to an ecosystem if just one species goes extinct? What if that one species was a producer or decomposer? Would the loss of a producer have an effect on all the organisms that relied on that producer? If a decomposer vanishes, are there other decomposers to fill the void? Maybe the resulting species will adapt. Other species may fill in the niche left by the extinct species. But the extinction of one species could have a \"domino\" effect, resulting in the extinction of other species. This could greatly effect the stability of the whole ecosystem. The air-conditioning efficiency of this ter- mite mound was the inspiration for the Eastgate Centre. One important role of biodiversity is that it helps keep the nutrients, such as nitrogen, in the soil. For example, a diversity of organisms in the soil allows nitrogen fixation and nutrient recycling to happen. Biodiversity also allows plants to be pollinated by different types of insects. And of course, different species of fungi are necessary to recycle wastes from dead plants and animals. These are just a few of the many examples of how biodiversity is important for ecosystems.

People have always hunted birds for food. People eventually discovered that certain wild fowl (ducks, chickens, turkeys) could be tamed. This discovery led to the development of poultry, which is domesticated fowl that farmers raise for meat and eggs. Chickens are probably the oldest kinds of poultry. Chickens were domesticated in Asia at least 3,000 years ago. Since then, farmers have developed other poultry, including ducks, geese, guineafowl, pheasants, and turkeys. Around the world, people consume all these birds, and even more exotic birds, like ostriches. Today, chickens rank as the most widely raised poultry by far. Farmers throughout the world produce hundreds of millions of chickens annually for meat and eggs. Ducks and turkeys rank second and third in production worldwide. Ducks are raised for both meat and eggs. Turkeys are raised mainly for meat. Can you think of other ways that birds are important? ", "1. In agriculture, humans harvest bird droppings for use as fertilizer. These droppings have a high content of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium, three nutrients essential for plant growth. 2. Chickens are also used as an early warning system of human diseases, such as West Nile virus. Mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus, bite young chickens and other birds, and infect them with the virus. When chickens or other birds become infected, humans may also become infected in the near future. 3. Birds have important cultural relationships with humans. Birds are common pets in the Western world. Common bird pets include canaries, parrots, finches, and parakeets. Sometimes, people act cooperatively with birds. For example, the Borana people in Africa use birds to guide them to honey that they use in food. 4. Birds also play prominent and diverse roles in folklore, religion, and popular culture. They have been featured in art since prehistoric times, when they appeared in early cave paintings. Many young child know of Big Bird, a very large canary of Sesame Street fame. 5. Feathers are also used all over the world to stuff pillows, mattresses, sleeping bags, coats, and quilting. Goose feathers are preferred because they are soft. Manufacturers often mix goose feathers with down feathers to provide extra softness. ", "Birds are obviously important members of many ecosystems. They are integral parts of food chains and food webs. In a woodland ecosystem for example, some birds get their food mainly from plants. Others chiefly eat small animals, such as insects or earthworms. Birds and bird eggs, in turn, serve as food for such animals as foxes, raccoons, and snakes. The feeding relationships among all the animals in an ecosystem help prevent any one species from becoming too numerous. Birds play a vital role in keeping this balance of nature. In addition to being important parts of food webs, birds play other roles within ecosystems. 1. Birds eat insects. They are a natural way to control pests in gardens, on farms, and other places. A group of birds gliding through the air can easily eat hundreds of insects each day. Insect eating birds include warblers, bluebirds and woodpeckers. 2. Nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, meaning they move the pollen from flower to flower to help fertilize the sex cells and create new plants. Hummingbirds, sunbirds, and the honey-eaters are common pollinators. 3. Many fruit-eating birds help disperse seeds. After eating fruit, they carry the seeds in their intestines and deposit them in new places. Fruit-eating birds include mockingbirds, orioles, finches and robins. 4. Birds are often important to island ecology. In New Zealand, the kereru and kokako are important browsers, or animals that eat or nibble on leaves, tender young shoots, or other vegetation .

Sand dollars and sea cucumbers burrow into the sand, providing more oxygen at greater depths of the sea floor. This allows more organisms to live there. In addition, starfish prevent the growth of algae on coral reefs. This allows the coral to filter-feed more easily. And many sea cucumbers provide a habitat for parasites such as crabs, worms, and snails. Echinoderms are also an important step in the ocean food chain. Echinoderms are the staple diet of many animals, including the sea otter. On the other hand, echinoderms eat seaweed and keep its growth in check. Recall that the sea urchin is a grazer, mainly feeding on algae on the coral and rocks. Recently, some marine ecosystems have been overrun by seaweed. Excess seaweed can destroy entire reefs. Scientists believe that the extinction of large quantities of echinoderms has caused this destruction . A large die-off of the sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, in the Caribbean Sea coin- cided with increases in algal growth in some areas but not others. ", "In some countries, echinoderms are considered delicacies. Around 50,000 tons of sea urchins are captured each year for food. They are consumed mostly in Japan, Peru, Spain and France. Both male and female gonads of sea urchins are also consumed. The taste is described as soft and melting, like a mixture of seafood and fruit. Sea cucumbers are considered a delicacy in some southeastern Asian countries. In China they are used as a basis for gelatinous soups and stews. ", "Echinoderms are also used as medicine and in scientific research. For example, some sea cucumber toxins slow down the growth rate of tumor cells, so there is an interest in using these in cancer research. Sea urchins are also model organisms used in developmental biology research. Sea urchins have been used to study the mechanisms of fertilization and egg activation, physiological processes that occur during early development, and the regulation of differentiation in the early embryo. In addition, the molecular basis of early development was studied in sea urchins. Gametes can be obtained easily, sterility is not required, and the eggs and early embryos of many commonly used species are beautifully transparent. In addition, the early development of sea urchin embryos is a highly conserved process. When a batch of eggs is fertilized, all of the resulting embryos typically develop at the same time. This makes biochemical and molecular studies of early embryos possible in the sea urchin, and has led to a number of major discoveries. ", "The hard skeleton of echinoderms is used as a source of lime by farmers in some areas where limestone is unavailable. Lime is added to the soil to allow plants to take up more nutrients. About 4,000 tons of the animals are used each year for this purpose.

While a select few insects, such as the Arctic Wooly Bear Moth, live in the harsh Arctic climate, the majority of insects are found in the warm and moist tropics. Insects have adapted to a broad range of habitats, successfully finding their own niche, because they will eat almost any substance that has nutritional value. Insects are crucial components of many ecosystems, where they perform many important functions. They aerate the soil, pollinate blossoms, and control insect and plant pests. Many insects, especially beetles, are scavengers, feeding on dead animals and fallen trees, thereby recycling nutrients back into the soil. As decomposers, insects help create top soil, the nutrient-rich layer of soil that helps plants grow. Burrowing bugs, such as ants and beetles, dig tunnels that provide channels for water, benefiting plants. Bees, wasps, butterflies, and ants pollinate flowering plants . Gardeners love the big-eyed bug and praying mantis because they control the size of certain insect populations, such as aphids and caterpillars, which feed on new plant growth. Finally, all insects fertilize the soil with the nutrients from their droppings. Bees are important pollinators of flower- ing plants. ", "Insects have tremendous economic importance. Some insects produce useful substances, such as honey, wax, lacquer, and silk. Honeybees have been raised by humans for thousands of years for honey. The silkworm greatly affected human history. When the Chinese used worms to develop silk, the silk trade connected China to the rest of the world. Adult insects, such as crickets, as well as insect larvae, are also commonly used as fishing bait. ", "Insects, of course, are not just eaten by people. Insects are the sole food source for many amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, making their roles in food chains and food webs extremely important. It is possible that food webs could collapse if insect populations decline. In some parts of the world, insects are used for food by humans. Insects are a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and are prized as delicacies in many third-world countries. In fact, it is difficult to find an insect that is not eaten in one form or another by people. Among the most popular are cicadas, locusts, mantises, grubs, caterpillars, crickets, ants, and wasps. Many people support this idea to provide a source of protein in human nutrition. From South America to Japan, people eat roasted insects, like grasshoppers or beetles. ", "Insects have also been used in medicine. In the past, fly larvae ( maggots) were used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene. Gangrene is caused by infection of dead flesh.

", "Mammals have important roles in the food webs of practically every ecosystem. Mammals are important members of food chains and food webs, as grazers and predators. Mammals can feed at various levels of food chains, as herbivores, insectivores, carnivores and omnivores. Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic relationships. For example, bats have established mutually beneficial relationships with plants. Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat from each flower, and, in return, they pollinate the flowers. That means they transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing the plant to reproduce. Non-flying mammalian pollinators include marsupials, primates, and rodents. In most cases, these animals visit flowers to eat their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies. When the animal visits another flower to eat the nectar, the pollen is transferred to that flower. Fruit-eating bats  also receive food from plants. In return, they help these plants spread their seeds. When bats consume fruit, they also consume the seeds within the fruit. Then they carry the seeds in their guts to far-away locations. Zebras have been known to befriend ostriches. In this symbiotic relationship, both species benefit. The ostrich, with its terrible senses of smell and hearing and the zebra with its poor eyesight, are both able to warn the other when danger is near. The zebra can smell or hear certain dangers approaching, while the ostrich can see other dangers. Both are prepared to warn one another at a moments notice so they can each flee when necessary. Baboons and impala have a similar relationship. Impala are one of the most common prey species for all predators and need to be constantly alert. Impala have good hearing and eyesight, raising an alarm when danger is near. Baboons use trees to check for danger and bark an alarm when danger is sensed. What do the baboons receive? Male baboons sometimes prey on young impala soon after birth. So, though both alert others to dangers, sometimes this is not the best of relationships for young impala. Zebra and wildebeest are found together on the African savanna grazing different parts of the same grass. The zebra grazes the tougher parts of the plant, saving the softer parts for the wildebeest. A zebra will move into an area of tall grass before other herbivores and graze the grass down to the area that the wildebeest prefers. Bats, like this Egyptian fruit bat, play an important role in seed dispersal. ", "We see examples of mammals (other than people!) serving our needs everywhere. We have pets that are mammals, such as dogs and cats. Mammals are also used around the world for transport. For example, horses, donkeys, mules, or camels  may be the primary means of transport in some parts of the world. Mammals also do work for us. Service dogs can be trained to help the disabled. These include guide dogs, which are assistance dogs trained to lead blind and visually impaired people around obstacles. Horses and elephants can carry heavy loads. Humans also use some mammals for food. For example, cows and goats are commonly raised for their milk and meat. Mammals more highly developed brains have made them ideal for use by scientists in studying such things as learning, as seen in maze studies of mice and rats. ", "Mammals have also played a significant role in different cultures folklore and religion. For example, the grace and power of the cougar have been admired in the cultures of the native peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cuzco is designed in the shape of a cougar, and the thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal. In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of several American Indian tribes. Important mammals include Dolly the sheep, Lassie the dog, and flipper the dolphin. Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic (body) cell, using the process of nuclear transfer. Lassie was a collie dog who appeared in seven full length feature films in the 1940s and 1950s, starting with Lassie Come Home in 1943. Additional Lassie movies were made as recently as 2005. Between 1954 and 1973, the Lassie television series aired, with plenty of additional productions as recently as 2007. Flipper was a bottle nose dolphin that starred in a television series between 1964 and 1967.

Eating mollusks is associated with a risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. At certain times of the year, (usually the warmer months) many species of saltwater mollusks become very poisonous due to an algal bloom known as \"red tide.\" The mollusks filter feed on the tiny creatures (called dinoflagellates in the bloom) that produce the toxins. Eating shellfish during a red tide can cause serious illness and even death to humans. Tastes in molluscan food vary tremendously from one person to the next and from culture to culture; however, when it comes to a question of survival, most mollusks are edible. Some are considered delicacies such as oysters and escargot (a snail that lives in trees), while others such as the clams and mussels of freshwater ponds and streams are less likely to be consumed due to taste, but none-the-less are very edible. Land-based mollusks are also eaten. France alone consumes 5 million pounds of escargot every year. Of course, some people are allergic to mollusks and need to be careful about consuming any kind of shelled animals. ", "Two natural products of mollusks used for decorations and jewelry are pearls and nacre. A pearl is the hard, round object produced within the mantle of a living shelled mollusk. Pearls are produced by many bivalves when a tiny particle of sand or grit is trapped between the mantle and the shell. Its as if the mollusk has a splinter. The mollusk forms a protective covering around the irritant. Most pearls used as jewelry are made by pearl oysters and freshwater mussels; most of the ones sold are cultured and not wild. Natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. The most desirable pearls are produced by oysters and river mussels. The substance used to form the pearl covering is made from the mother of pearl material that lines the interior of the shell. Mother of pearl is also known as nacre. Nacre is the iridescent inner shell layer. It can be found in buttons, watch faces, knives, guns, and jewelry. It is also used to decorate various musical instruments. ", "Several mollusks are ideal subjects for scientific investigation of the nervous system. The giant squid has a sophis- ticated nervous system and a complex brain for study. The California sea slug, also called the California sea hare, is used in studies of learning and memory because it has a simple nervous system, consisting of just a few thousand large, easily identified neurons. These neurons are responsible for a variety of learning tasks. Some slug brain studies have even allowed scientists to better understand human brains. Some octopuses and squid are incredibly smart. They are capable of learning to solve problems and do mazes.

", "Reptiles are important as food sources for people: Green iguanas, a type of large lizard, are eaten in Central America. The tribals of Irulas from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in India are known to eat some of the snakes they catch. Cantonese snake soup is consumed by local people in the fall to prevent colds. The soup is believed to warm up their body of those who eat it. Cooked rattlesnake meat is commonly consumed in parts of the Midwestern United States. You can eat rattlesnake meat without worry of the poisonous venom. Other snake meat is consumed throughout the world. Turtle soup is consumed throughout the world. ", "Reptiles also make good pets. In the Western world, some snakes, especially less aggressive species, like the ball python or corn snake, are kept as pets. Turtles, particularly small land-dwelling and freshwater turtles, are also common pets. Among the most popular are Russian tortoises, Greek spur-thighed tortoises, and terrapins. Large constrictor snakes like pythons, boa constrictors, and anacondas are powerful wild animals capable of killing an adult human, and they are commonly kept as pets. Many people dont think this is a wise idea, as these reptiles pose dangerous threats to people, especially children. Reptiles are capable of recognizing people by voice, sight and smell; many are capable of learning. Some species actually benefit from interaction with humans. When cared for properly, all live as long or longer than mammalian pets of similar size. Having a reptile as a pet, you get to learn about everything from adaptation, behavior and the environment, to nutrition, camouflage and reproductive strategies. Learning about the natural history and proper captive care of these animals just might change your world outlook and get you thinking more about the environment as a whole. Keep in mind that if you want to have a snake as a pet, that there are no herbivorous snakes, and you must be willing to feed it a proper diet. Be prepared to feed your snake, or other reptile, mice, rats, birds eggs, insects, or fish. And these need to be served raw. Of course, the herbivorous reptiles, such as the green iguanas and some tortoises, are much easier to feed. They eat foods such as chopped collard greens, romaine lettuce, chopped squash and bananas. ", "Finally, reptiles play a significant role in folklore, religion, and popular culture. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped reptiles and often put lizards in their art. Snakes or serpents are connected to healing and to the Devil. Since snakes shed and then heal again, they are a symbol of healing and medicine, as shown in the Rod of Asclepius . In Egyptian history, the Nile cobra is found on the crown of the pharaoh. This snake was worshiped as one of the gods. Reptiles have also played roles in more recent popular culture. Unforgettable reptiles include Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo, and Raphael, otherwise known as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Godzilla, one of the most famous movie reptiles who has been terrorizing Japanese cities for years. Dino, from The Flintstones is one of the more lovable television reptiles. On the other hand is Nagini from the Harry Potter series. This tremendously long snake (roughly 12 feet) is difficult to forget as she was very important to Lord Voldemort. Though her appearances are far and few between, her unwavering loyalty to the Dark Lord makes her one of the more infamous reptiles.

Peat moss is commonly used by gardeners to improve soils, since it is really good at absorbing and holding water . Depending on the location, ferns have several different uses worldwide. Ferns are found in many gardens as ornaments, and are used as indoor plants. In tropical regions, the fern is used as a food source by many locals. The fronds can also be used to weave hats and baskets. The fiddleheads of certain species of ferns are used in gourmet food. Some species of ferns, such as the maidenhair fern, are used as medicines. In Southeast Asia, the fern is used in rice fields as a biological fertilizer. Much of the worlds fossil fuels consist of remains of ferns and their relatives. The horsetails reedy exterior and silica content made it popular as a metal polisher and abrasive cleanser. Herbalists still use horsetail to treat a variety of kidney/bladder problems, including inflammation, infection, and kidney stones, and it is used as a remedy for brittle nails. Club moss is also used to treat kidney ailments and digestive problems. Club moss spores can be dusted onto the skin and provide relief from itching and irritation, and provide the skin with protection. Extinct forests of club moss have fossilized and developed into huge beds of coal. Sphagnum, or peat moss, is commonly added to soil to help absorb water, and keep it in the soil.

They dont have to learn how to behave in these ways. Cats are natural-born hunters. They dont need to learn how to hunt. Spiders spin their complex webs without learning how to do it from other spiders. Birds and wasps know how to build nests without being taught. These behaviors are called innate. An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all animals of a given species. An innate behavior is also called an instinct. The first time an animal performs an innate behavior, the animal does it well. The animal does not have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or become better at it. Innate behaviors are also predictable. All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way. From the examples described above, you can probably tell that innate behaviors usually involve important actions, like eating and caring for the young. There are many other examples of innate behaviors. For example, did you know that honeybees dance? The honeybee pictured below has found a source of food . When the bee returns to its hive, it will do a dance. This dance is called the waggle dance. The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior. Besides building nests, birds have other innate behaviors. One example occurs in gulls, which are pictured below ; one of the chicks is pecking at a red spot on the mothers beak. This innate behavior causes the mother Left: This mother gull will feed her chick after it pecks at a red spot on her beak. Both pecking and feeding behaviors are innate. Right: When these baby birds open their mouths wide, their mother in- stinctively feeds them. This innate behav- ior is called gaping. to feed the chick. In many other species of birds, the chicks open their mouths wide whenever the mother returns to the nest . This innate behavior, called gaping, causes the mother to feed them. Another example of innate behavior in birds is egg rolling. It happens in some species of water birds, like the graylag goose . Graylag geese make nests on the ground. If an egg rolls out of the nest, a mother goose uses her bill to push it back into the nest. Returning the egg to the nest helps ensure that the egg will hatch. ", "All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings. Can you think of human behaviors that do not have to be learned? Chances are, you will have a hard time thinking of any. The only truly innate behaviors in humans are called reflex behaviors. They occur mainly in babies. Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies may help them survive. An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex. Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth. It is easy to see how this behavior evolved. It increases the chances of a baby feeding and surviving. Another example of a reflex behavior in babies is the grasp reflex . Babies instinctively grasp an object placed in the palm of their hand. Their grip may be surprisingly strong. How do you think this behavior might increase a babys chances of surviving? This female graylag goose is a ground- nesting water bird. Before her chicks hatch, the mother protects the eggs. She will use her bill to push eggs back into the nest if they roll out. This is an example of an innate behavior. How could this behavior increase the gooses fitness? One of the few innate behaviors in human beings is the grasp reflex. It occurs only in babies.

Aphids and leafhoppers suck up the sap from plants. Praying mantises are predators, hunting other small creatures, including insects like moths, caterpillars, flies, beetles, and spiders. Insects like mosquitoes and aphids have special mouthparts that help them pierce and suck. Others, like assassin bugs  and certain species of female mosquitoes, eat other insects. Fleas and lice are parasites, eating the flesh or blood of larger animals without killing them. Insects have different types of appendages (arms and legs) adapted for capturing and feeding on prey. They also have special senses that help them detect prey. Furthermore, insects have a wide range of mouthparts used for feeding. An assassin bug feasts on a beetle. Examples of chewing insects include dragonflies, grasshoppers, and beetles. These insects use one pair of jaws to bite off bits of food and grind them down. Another pair of jaws helps to push the food down the throat. Some larvae also have chewing mouthparts, as in the caterpillar stages of moths and butterflies . Caterpillar feeding on a host plant. Some insects use siphoning, as if sucking through a straw, like moths and butterflies. This long mouth-tube that they use to suck up the nectar of the flower is called a proboscis. Some moths, however, have no mouthparts at all. Some insects obtain food by sponging, like the housefly. Sponging means that the mouthpart can absorb liquid food and send it to the esophagus. The housefly is able to eat solid food by releasing saliva and dabbing it over the food. As the saliva dissolves the food, the sponging mouthpart absorbs the liquid food.

The outer layer of the exoskeleton is called the cuticle. It is made up of two layers. The outer layer, or exocuticle, is thin, waxy, and water-resistant. The inner layer is much thicker. The exocuticle is extremely thin in many soft-bodied insects, such as caterpillars. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct but joined units: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen .

Sound Production By moving appendages Cicadas Ultrasound clicks Moths Loudest sounds among insects; have special muscles to produce sounds. Predation: Produced mostly by moths to warn bats. Chemical Wide range of insects have evolved chemical communication; chemi- cals are used to attract, repel, or provide other kinds of information; use of scents is especially well de- veloped in social insects. Dance Language Moths Honey bees Antennae of males  can detect pheromones (chemicals released by animals that influence the behavior of others within the same species) of female moths over distances of many miles. Honey bees are the only inverte- brates to have evolved this type of communication; length of dance represents distance to be flown. ", "Social insects, such as termites, ants, and many bees and wasps , are the most familiar social species. They live together in large, well-organized colonies. Only those insects which live in nests or colonies can home. Homing means that an insect can return to a single hole among many other apparently identical holes, even after a long trip or after a long time. A few insects migrate in groups.

These animals range from bats, cats, and rats to dogs, monkeys, elephants, and whales. They walk, run, swim, and fly. They live in the ocean, fly in the sky, walk on the prairies, and run in the savanna. There is a tremendous amount of diversity within the group in terms of reproduction, habitat, and adaptation for living in those different habitats. What allows them to live in such diverse environments? They have evolved specialized traits, unlike those of any other group of animal. Mammals (class Mammalia) are endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrate animals with a number of unique characteristics. In most mammals, these include: The presence of hair or fur. Sweat glands. Glands specialized to produce milk, known as mammary glands. Three middle ear bones. A neocortex region in the brain, which specializes in seeing and hearing. Specialized teeth. A four-chambered heart. There are approximately 5,400 mammalian species, ranging in size from the tiny 1-2 inch bumblebee bat to the 108-foot blue whale. These are distributed in 29 orders, 153 families, and about 1,200 genera. There are three types of mammals, characterized by their method of reproduction. All mammals, except for a few, are viviparous, meaning they produce live young instead of laying eggs. The monotremes, however, have birdlike and reptilian characteristics, such as laying eggs and a cloaca. An example of a monotreme is the platypus with its birdlike beak and egg-laying characteristics. The echidnas are the only other monotreme mammals. A second type of mammal, the marsupial mammal, includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and possums. These mammals give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mothers body, where it feeds and continues to grow. The remainder of mammals, which is the majority of mammals, are placental mammals. These mammals develop in the mothers uterus, receiving nutrients across the placenta. Placental mammals include humans, rabbits, squirrels, whales, elephants, shrews, and armadillos. Dogs and cats, and sheep, cattle and horses are also placental mammals. Mammals are also the only animal group that evolved to live on land and then back to live in the ocean. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises have all adapted from land-dwelling creatures to a life of swimming and reproducing in the water . Whales have evolved into the largest mammals.

There are exceptions, however. Egg-laying is possible among the monotremes, mammals with birdlike and reptilian characteristics. Recall that mammals can be classified into three general groups, based on their reproductive strategy: the monotremes, the marsupials and the placental mammals. The egg-laying monotremes, such as echidnas  and platypuses , use one opening, the cloaca, to urinate, release waste, and reproduce, just like birds. They lay leathery eggs, similar to those of lizards, turtles, and crocodilians. Monotremes feed their young by sweating milk from patches on their bellies, as they lack the nipples present on other mammals. All other mammals give birth to live young and belong to one of two different categories, the marsupials and the placental mammals. A marsupial is an animal in which the embryo, which is often called a joey, is born at an immature stage. Development must be completed outside the mothers body. Most female marsupials have an abdominal pouch or skin fold where there are mammary glands. The pouch is a place for completing the development of the baby. Although blind, without fur, and with only partially formed hind legs, the tiny newborns have well developed forelimbs with claws that enable them to climb their way into their mothers pouch where they drink their mothers milk and continue their development. Marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums. Other marsupials are the wallaby and the Tasmanian Devil. Most marsupials live in Australia and nearby areas. ( Figure The echidna (right) is a member of the monotremes, the most primitive order of mammals. Another monotreme, the platy- pus (left), like other mammals in this or- der, lays eggs and has a single opening for the urinary, genital, and digestive or- gans. The majority of mammals are placental mammals. These are mammals in which the developing baby is fed through the mothers placenta. Female placental mammals develop a placenta after fertilization. A placenta is a spongy structure that passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus. It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta allows the fetus to grow for a long time within the mother. A marsupial mammal, this eastern gray kangaroo has a joey (young kangaroo) in its abdominal pouch. Some mammals are alone until a female can become pregnant. Others form social groups with big differences between sexes, such as size differences, a trait called sexual dimorphism. Dominant males are those that are the largest or best-armed. These males usually have an advantage in mating. They may also keep other males from mating with females within a group. This is seen in elephant seals , and also with elk, lions and non- human primates, including the orangutans and gorillas. Male elk grow antlers, while female elk do not have antlers. Adult male lions are not only larger than females, they have a mane of long hair on the side of the face and top of the head.

Extinctions are part of natural selection. Species often go extinct when their environment changes, and they do not have the traits they need to survive. Only those individuals with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive (Survival of the Fittest) . Mass extinctions, such as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine mammals, happened after major catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes . Since life began on Earth, there have been several major mass extinctions. If you look closely at the geological time scale, you will find that at least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past 540 million years. In each mass extinction, over 50% of animal species died. Though species go extinct frequently, a mass extinction in which such a high percentage of species go extinct is rare. The total number of mass extinctions could be as high as 20. It is probable that we are currently in the midst of another mass extinction. Two of the largest extinctions are described below: The fossil of Tarbosaurus, one of the land dinosaurs that went extinct during one of the mass extinctions. At the end of the Permian Period, it is estimated that about 99.5% of individual organisms went extinct! Up to 95% of marine species perished, compared to only 70% of land species. Some scientists theorize that the extinction was caused by the formation of Pangaea, or one large continent made out of many smaller ones. One large continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones, so reducing the shoreline space may have The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of todays continents in a single land mass. This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species. This may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permianthe most massive extinction ever recorded. At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct. Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid. The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, increased atmospheric dust and clouds, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an iridium-rich layer in the Earth, dated at 65.5 million years ago. Iridium is rare in the Earths crust but common in comets and asteroids. Maybe the asteroid that hit the Earth left the iridium behind. After each mass extinction, new species evolve to fill the habitats where old species lived. This is well documented in the fossil record.

All the offspring had purple flowers. There was no blending of traits in any of Mendels experiments. Mendel had to come up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results. He developed a theory called the law of segregation. ", "Mendel proposed that each pea plant had two hereditary factors for each trait. There were two possibilities for each hereditary factor, such as a purple factor or white factor. One factor is dominant to the other. The other trait that is masked is called the recessive factor, meaning that when both factors are present, only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable . Although you have two hereditary factors for each trait, each parent can only pass on one of these factors to the offspring. When the sex cells, or gametes (sperm or egg), form, the heredity factors must separate, so there is only one factor per gamete. In other words, the factors are \"segregated\" in each gamete. Mendels law of segregation states that the two hereditary factors separate when gametes are formed. When fertilization occurs, the offspring receive one hereditary factor from each gamete, so the resulting offspring have two factors. The law of segregation predates our understanding or meiosis. Mendel developed his theories without an under- standing of DNA, or even the knowledge that DNA existed. Quite a remarkable feat! In peas, purple flowers are dominant to white. If one of these purple flowers is crossed with a white flower, all the offspring will have purple flowers. ", "This law explains what Mendel had seen in the F1 generation when a tall plant was crossed with a short plant. The two heredity factors in this case were the short and tall factors. Each individual in the F1 would have one of each factor, and as the tall factor is dominant to the short factor (the recessive factor), all the plants appeared tall. In describing genetic crosses, letters are used. The dominant factor is represented with a capital letter (T for tall) while the recessive factor is represented by a lowercase letter (t). For the T and t factors, three combinations are possible: TT, Tt, and tt. TT plants will be tall, while plants with tt will be short. Since T is dominant to t, plants that are Tt will be tall because the dominant factor masks the recessive factor. In this example, we are crossing a TT tall plant with a tt short plant. As each parent gives one factor to the F1 generation, all of the F1 generation will be Tt tall plants. When the F1 generation (Tt) is allowed to self-pollinate, each parent will give one factor (T or t) to the F2 generation. So the F2 offspring will have four possible combinations of factors: TT, Tt, tT, or tt. According to the laws of probability, 25% of the offspring would be tt, so they would appear short. And 75% would have at least one T factor and would be tall.

You can inherit objects, but you can also inherit traits. For example, you can inherit a parents eye color, hair color, or even the shape of your nose and ears! Genetics is the study of inheritance. The field of genetics seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next. In the late 1850s, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel  performed the first genetics experiments. To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits . For example, pea plants are either tall or short, which is an easy trait to observe. Furthermore, pea plants grow quickly, so he could complete many experiments in a short period of time. Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate or be cross-pollinated. Self-pollination means that only one flower is involved; the flowers own pollen lands on the female sex organs. Cross pollination is done by hand by moving pollen from one flower to the stigma of another (just like bees do naturally). As a result, one plants sex cells combine with another plants sex cells. This is called a \"cross.\" These crosses produce offspring Gregor Mendel, the \"father\" of genetics. Characteristics of pea plants. (or \"children\"), just like when male and female animals mate. Since Mendel could move pollen between plants, he could carefully control and then observe the results of crosses between two different types of plants. He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas, including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds, white flowers versus purple flowers, and tall plants versus short plants. Because of his work, Mendel is considered the \"Father of Genetics.\" ", "In one of Mendels early experiments, he crossed a short plant and a tall plant. What do you predict the offspring of these plants were? Medium-sized plants? Most people during Mendels time would have said medium-sized. But an unexpected result occurred. Mendel observed that the offspring of this cross (called the F1 generation) were all tall plants! Next, Mendel let the F1 generation self-pollinate. That means the tall plant offspring were crossed with each other. He found that 75% of their offspring (the F2 generation) were tall, while 25% were short. Shortness skipped a generation. But why? In all, Mendel studied seven characteristics, with almost 20,000 F2 plants analyzed. All of his results were similar to the first experimentabout three out of every four plants had one trait, while just one out of every four plants had the other. For example, he crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants. Do you think the colors blended? No, they did not. Just like the previous experiment, all offspring in this cross (the F1 generation) were one color: purple. In the F2 generation, 75% of plants had purple flowers and 25% had white flowers . There was no blending of traits in any of Mendels experiments. The results of Mendels experiment with purple flowered and white flowered-plants numerically matched the results of his experiments with other pea plant traits.

When populations change in small ways over time, the process is called microevolution. Microevolution results in changes within a species. An example of microevolution is the evolution of mosquitoes that cannot be killed by pesticides, called pesticide- resistant mosquitoes. Imagine that you have a pesticide that kills most of the mosquitoes in your state. Through a random mutation, some of the mosquitoes have resistance to the pesticide. As a result of the widespread use of this pesticide, most of the remaining mosquitoes are the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes. When these mosquitoes repro- duce the next year, they produce more mosquitoes with the pesticide-resistant trait. Soon, most of the mosquitoes in your state are resistant to the pesticide. This is an example of microevolution because the number of mosquitoes with this trait changed. However, this evolutionary change did not create a new species of mosquito because the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes can still reproduce with other non-pesticide-resistant mosquitoes.

These clocks are sometimes called gene clocks or evolutionary clocks. The fewer the differences, the less time since the species split from each other and began to evolve into different species .

Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce.

Evolution occurs by natural selection. Take the giant tortoises on the Galpagos Islands as an example.

No, it will not, because it will not be able to reach the food it needs to survive.

Natural selection only operates on traits like ear- lobe shape that have a genetic basis, not on traits that are acquired, like a summer tan. \"naturally selected\" to survive. Organisms that are not well-adapted, for whatever reason, to their environment, will naturally have less of a chance of surviving and reproducing. Every plant and animal depends on its traits to survive. Survival may include getting food, building homes, and attracting mates. Traits that allow a plant, animal, or other organism to survive and reproduce in its environment are called adaptations. Natural selection occurs when: 1. There is some variation in the inherited traits of organisms within a species. Without this variation, natural selection would not be possible. 2. Some of these traits will give individuals an advantage over others in surviving and reproducing. 3. These individuals will be likely to have more offspring. Imagine how in the Arctic, dark fur makes a rabbit easy for foxes to spot and catch in the snow. Therefore, white fur is a beneficial trait that improves the chance that a rabbit will survive, reproduce, and pass the trait of white fur on to its offspring . Through this process of natural selection, dark fur rabbits will become uncommon over time. Rabbits will adapt to have white fur. In essence, the selection of rabbits with white fur - the beneficial trait - is a natural process. ", "Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet. But why are there so many? Different species are well-adapted to live and survive in many different types of environments. As environments change over time, organisms must constantly adapt to those environments. Diversity of species increases the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment. For example, if a natural disaster kills all of the large organisms on the planet, then the small organisms will continue to survive.

If it is green and leafy, you probably call it a plant. If it is long and slithers, you probably call it as a snake. How do you make these decisions? You look at the physical features of the organism and think about what it has in common with other organisms. Scientists do the same thing when they classify, or put into categories, living things. Scientists classify organisms not only by their physical features, but also by how closely related they are. Lions and tigers look like each other more than they look like bears, but are lions and tigers related? Evolutionarily speaking, yes. Evolution is the change in a species over time. Lions and tigers both evolved from a common ancestor. So it turns out that the two cats are actually more closely related to each other than to bears. How an organism looks and how it is related to other organisms determines how it is classified. ", "People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a classification system that divided living things into several groups that we still use today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles. Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778)  built on Aristotles work to create his own classification system. He invented the way we name organisms today, with each organism having a two word name. Linnaeus is considered the inventor of modern taxonomy, the science of naming and grouping organisms. In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete classification system then known. Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature, a way to give a scientific name to every organism. In this system, each organism receives a two-part name in which the first word is the genus (a group of species), and the second word refers to one species in that genus. For example, a coyotes species name is Canis latrans. Latrans is the species and Canis is the genus, a larger group that includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals. Here is another example: the red maple, Acer rubra, and the sugar maple, Acer saccharum, are both in the same genus and they look similar . Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientific name is in italics. Tigers (Panthera tigris) and lions (Panthera leo) have the same genus name, but are obviously different species. The names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called Latin. These leaves are from two different species of trees in the Acer, or maple, genus. The green leaf (far left) is from the sugar maple, and the red leaf (center ) are from the red maple. One of the character- istics of the maple genus is winged seeds (far right). ", "Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since Linnaeus. The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category . All organisms can be classified into one of three domains, the least specific grouping. The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The Kingdom is the next category after the Domain. All life is divided among six kingdoms: Kingdom Bacteria, Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista, Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia. This diagram illustrates the classification categories for organisms, with the broad- est category (kingdom) at the bottom, and the most specific category (species) at the top. We are Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus of great apes that includes modern humans and closely related species, and sapiens is the only living species of the genus. ", "Even though naming species is straightforward, deciding if two organisms are the same species can sometimes be difficult. Linnaeus defined each species by the distinctive physical characteristics shared by these organisms. But two members of the same species may look quite different. For example, people from different parts of the world sometimes look very different, but we are all the same species . So how is a species defined? A species is defined as a group of similar individuals that can interbreed with one another and produce fertile offspring. A species does not produce fertile offspring with other species.

Most new species develop naturally. But humans have also artificially created new breeds and species for thousands of years. New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection. Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffes neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a populations gene pool (changing the populations allele frequencies), some of these changes will be beneficial and result in traits that allow adaptation and survival. Natural selection causes evolution of a species as these beneficial traits become more common within a population. Evolution can occur within a species without completely resulting in a new species. Therefore, evolution and speciation are not the same. ", "Artificial selection occurs when humans select which plants or animals to breed in order to pass on specific traits to the next generation. For example, a farmer may choose to breed only cows that produce the best milk. Farmers would also avoid breeding cows that produce less milk. In this way, selective breeding of the cows would increase milk quality and quantity. Humans have also artificially bred dogs to create new breeds . Artificial Selection: Humans used artificial selection to create these different breeds. Both dog breeds are descended from the same wolves, and their genes are almost identical. ", "There are two main ways that speciation happens naturally. Both processes create new species by reproductively isolating populations of the same species from each other. Organisms can be geographically isolated or isolated by a behavior. Either way, they will no longer be able to mate. Over a long period of time, usually thousands of years, each of the isolated populations evolves in a different direction, forming distinct species. How do you think scientists test whether two populations are separate species? They bring species from two populations back together again. If the two populations do not mate and produce fertile offspring, they are separate species. ", "Allopatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species are geographically isolated for long periods. Imagine all the ways that plants or animals could be isolated from each other: Emergence of a mountain range. Formation of a canyon. New rivers or streams. Here are two examples of allopatric speciation: Darwin observed thirteen distinct finch species on the Galpagos Islands that had evolved from the same ancestor. Different finch populations lived on separate islands with different environments. They evolved to best adapt to those particular environments. Later, scientists were able to determine which finches had evolved into distinct species by bringing members of each population together. The birds that could not mate were a separate species. When the Grand Canyon in Arizona formed, two populations of one squirrel species were separated by the giant canyon. After thousands of years of isolation from each other, the squirrel populations on the northern wall of the canyon looked and behaved differently from those on the southern wall . North rim squirrels have white tails and black bellies. Squirrels on the south rim have white bellies and dark tails. They cannot mate with each other, so they are different species. Abert squirrel (left) on the southern rim of the Grand Canyon. Kaibab squirrel (right) found on northern rim of the Grand Canyon. ", "Sympatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than physical or geographic separation. The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is an example of such separation. The separation may be caused by different mating seasons, for example. Sympatric speciation is more difficult to identify. Here are two examples of sympatric speciation: Some scientists suspect that two groups of orcas (killer whales) live in the same part of the Pacific Ocean part of the year but do not mate. The two groups hunt different prey species, eat different foods, sing different songs, and have different social interactions . Two groups of Galpagos Island finch species lived in the same space, but each had his or her own distinct mating signals. Members of each group selected mates according to different beak structures and bird calls. The behavioral differences kept the groups separated until they formed different species.

So, where did plants come from? Evidence shows that plants evolved from freshwater green algae, a protist . The similarities between green algae and plants is one piece of evidence. They both have cellulose in their cell walls, and they share many of the same chemicals that give them color. So what separates green algae from green plants? There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a result, became different from algae: The ancestor of plants is green algae. This picture shows a close up of algae on the beach. 1. In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization. Algae do not keep the embryo inside of themselves but release it into water. This was the first feature to evolve that separated plants from green algae. This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants. 2. Over time, plants had to evolve from living in water to living on land. In early plants, a waxy layer called a cuticle evolved to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss. However, the cuticle also prevents gases from entering and leaving the plant easily. Recall that the exchange of gassestaking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygenoccurs during photosynthesis. 3. To allow the plant to retain water and exchange gases, small pores (holes) in the leaves called stomata also evolved . The stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions. When its hot and dry, the stomata close to keep water inside of the plant. When the weather cools down, the stomata can open again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out. 4. A later adaption for life on land was the evolution of vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. In algae, vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the water, and the water simply enters the algae. But on land, water may only be found deep in the ground. Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant. The two vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. Phloem carries the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed.

Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and zebra, the bear and fish, and the fox and rabbit. There are different types of predation, including: true predation. grazing. parasitism. True predation is when a predator kills and eats its prey. Some predators of this type, such as jaguars, kill large prey. They tear it apart and chew it before eating it. Others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, may eat their prey whole. In some cases, the prey dies in the mouth or the digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, This lion is an example of a predator on the hunt. eat millions of plankton at once. The prey is digested afterward. True predators may hunt actively for prey, or they may sit and wait for prey to get within striking distance. Certain traits enable organisms to be effective hunters. These include camouflage, speed, and heightened senses. These traits also enable certain prey to avoid predators. In grazing, the predator eats part of the prey but does not usually kill it. You may have seen cows grazing on grass. The grass they eat grows back, so there is no real effect on the population. In the ocean, kelp (a type of seaweed) can regrow after being eaten by fish. Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species. These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Prey also have adaptations for avoiding predators. Prey sometimes avoid detection by using camouflage ( Figure background. Mimicry is a related adaptation in which a species uses appearance to copy or mimic another species. For example, a non-poisonous dart frog may evolve to look like a poisonous dart frog. Why do you think this is an adaptation for the non-poisonous dart frog? Mimicry can be used by both predators and prey . Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship and will be described in the Symbiosis concept. Camouflage by the dead leaf mantis makes it less visible to both its predators and prey. If alarmed, it lies motionless on the rainforest floor of Madagascar, Africa, camouflaged among the actual dead leaves. It eats other animals up to the size of small lizards. An example of mimicry, where the Viceroy butterfly (right) mimics the unpleasant Monarch butterfly (left). Both butterfly species are avoided by predators to a greater degree than either one would be without mimicry.

Primates, including humans, have several unique features. Some adaptations give primates advantages that allow them to live in certain habitats, such as in trees. Other features have allowed them to adapt to complex social and cultural situations. Primates are mostly omnivorous, meaning many primate species eat both plant and animal material. The order contains all of the species commonly related to lemurs, monkeys, and apes. The order also includes humans . Key features of primates include: Five fingers, known as pentadactyl. Several types of teeth. Certain eye orbit characteristics, such as a postorbital bar, or a bone that runs around the eye socket. An opposable thumb, a finger that allows a grip that can hold objects. (top left) Ring-tailed lemurs. Lemurs be- long to the prosimian group of primates. (top right) One of the New World mon- keys, a squirrel monkey.

This subspecies of humans lived in Europe and western and central Asia from about 100,000 40,000 BCE. Whats the difference between monkeys and apes? The easiest way to distinguish monkeys from the other primates is to look for a tail. Most monkey species have tails, but no apes or humans do. Monkeys are much more like other mammals than apes and humans are. ", "In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger compared to the rest of the brain. A larger cerebrum allows primates to develop higher levels of intelligence. Primates have the ability to learn new behaviors. They also engage in complex social interactions, such as fighting and play. ", "Old World species, such as apes and some monkeys , tend to have significant size differences between the sexes. This is known as sexual dimorphism. Males tend to be slightly more than twice as heavy as females. This dimorphism may have evolved when one male had to defend many females. Old World generally refers to monkeys of Africa and Asia. New World refers to monkeys of the Americas. New World species, including tamarins (squirrel-sized monkeys) and marmosets (very small primitive monkeys) , form pair bonds, which is a partnership between a mating pair that lasts at least one season. The pair cooperatively raise the young and generally do not show a significant size difference between the sexes. Old World monkeys do not tend to form monogamous relationships.

", "Non-human primates live mostly in Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Since primates evolved from animals living in trees, many modern species still live mostly in trees. Other species live on land most of the time, such as baboons  and the Patas monkey. Only a few species live on land all of the time, such as the gelada and humans. Primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats, including rain forests, mangrove forests and mountain forests to altitudes of over 9,800 feet. The combination of opposable thumbs, short fingernails, and long, inward-closing fingers has allowed some species to develop the ability to move by swinging their arms from one branch to another . Another feature for climbing are expanded finger-like parts, such as those in tarsiers, which improve grasping . A few species, such as the proboscis monkey, De Brazzas monkey, and Allens swamp monkey, evolved webbed fingers so they can swim and live in swamps and aquatic habitats. Some species, such as the rhesus macaque and the Hanuman langur, can even live in cities by eating human garbage. (left) A gibbon shows how its limbs are modified for hanging from trees.

Endocytosis happens when a cell takes in substances through its membrane. The process is described below: 1. The protist wraps around its prey, which is usually bacteria. 2. It creates a food vacuole, a sort of \"food storage compartment,\" around the bacteria. 3. The protist produces toxins which paralyze its prey. 4.

For their part, males try to be chosen as mates. They show females that they would be a better mate than the other males. To be chosen as a mate, males may perform courtship behaviors. These are special behaviors that help attract a mate. Male courtship behaviors get the attention of females and show off a males traits. These behaviors are often observed as direct competition between males. Different species have different courtship behaviors. One example is a peacock raising his tail feathers. The colorful peacock is trying to impress females of his species with his beautiful feathers. Another example of courtship behavior in birds is the blue-footed booby. He is doing a dance to attract a female for mating. During the dance, he spreads out his wings and stamps his feet on the ground.

For example, males in some species of whales have special mating songs to attract females as mates. Frogs croak for the same reason. Male deer clash antlers to court females. Male jumping spiders jump from side to side to attract mates. Courtship behaviors are one type of display behavior. A display behavior is a fixed set of actions that carries a specific message. Although many display behaviors are used to attract mates, some display behaviors have other purposes. For example, display behaviors may be used to warn other animals to stay away, as you will read below. ", "In most species of birds and mammals, one or both parents care for their offspring. Caring for the young may include making a nest or other shelter. It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from predators. Caring for offspring increases their chances of surviving. Birds called killdeers have an interesting way of protecting their chicks. When a predator gets too close to her nest, a mother killdeer pretends to have a broken wing. The mother walks away from the nest holding her wing as though it were injured . The predator thinks she is injured and will be easy prey. The mother leads the predator away from the nest and then flies away. In most species of mammals, parents also teach their offspring important skills. For example, meerkat parents teach their pups how to eat scorpions without being stung. A scorpion sting can be deadly, so this is a very important skill. ", "Some species of animals are territorial. This means that they defend their area. The area they defend usually contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area. Having a larger territory could mean more prey or food. Animals generally do not defend their territory by fighting. Instead, they are more likely to use display behavior. The behavior tells other animals to stay away. It gets the message across without the need for fighting. Display behavior is generally safer and uses less energy than fighting. Male gorillas use display behavior to defend their territory. They pound on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn other male gorillas to keep away from their area. The robin displays his red breast to warn other robins to stay away . The red breast of this male robin is easy to see. The robin displays his bright red chest to defend his territory. It warns other robins to keep out of his area. Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory. This is why dogs urinate on fire hydrants and other objects. Cats may also mark their territory by depositing chemicals.

They have a skin covered in scales to protect them from drying out. All reptiles have lungs to breathe air. Reptiles are also amniotes, which means their embryos are surrounded by a thin membrane. This membrane protects the embryo from the harsh conditions of living on land. Reptile eggs are also surrounded by a protective shell, which may be either flexible or inflexible. ", "Most reptiles reproduce sexually, meaning there are two parents involved. In some families of lizards and one snake family, however, asexual reproduction is possible. This is when only one parent is involved in creating new life. For example, the gecko females can make tiny clones of themselves without the aid of a male. All reptiles have a cloaca, a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste, located at the base of the tail. Most reptiles lay amniotic eggs covered with leathery or hard shell. These eggs can be placed anywhere as they dont have to be in a moist environment, like the eggs of amphibians. However, not all species lay eggs, as certain species of squamates can give birth to live young. Unlike the amphibians, there are no larval stages of development. The young reptiles look like miniature versions of the adult. The young reptiles are generally left to fend for themselves. However, some reptiles provide care for their young.

In addition to consuming many worms and insects and other arthropods, and even some small reptiles and mammals and fish, they are prey for turtles and snakes, as well as some fish and birds. Tadpoles keep waterways clean by feeding on algae. Frogs are raised as a food source for humans. Frog legs are a delicacy in China, France, the Philippines, northern Greece, and the American south, especially the Frensh-speaking parts of Louisiana.

", "Amphibians have long been used in scientific research, especially developmental and physiological processes, largely due to their unique ability to undergo metamorphosis, and in some species, to regenerate limbs. Amphibians are also used in cloning research. Cloning involves making identical copies of a parent organism, and the large amphibian egg helps in this process. They are also used to study embryos because their eggs lack shells, so it is easy to watch their development. The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is a species that is studied to understand aspects of developmental biology. It is a good model organism because it is easy to raise in a lab and has a large embryo, which is easy to study . Many Xenopus genes have been identified and cloned, especially those involved in development. Developing Xenopus embryos can be easily observed and studied with a basic microscope, though the eggs are large enough to see without a microscope. Because of their size, the exact developmental stage after fertilization can be easily determined. This allows proteins that are used at a specific developmental time to be collected and analyzed. Identification of Xenopus genes and proteins has allowed the identification of corresponding genes and proteins from humans. Many environmental scientists believe that amphibians, including frogs, indicate when an environment is damaged. When species of frogs begin to decline, it often indicates that there is a bigger problem within the ecosystem. This could have dramatic effects on food webs and ecosystems. Frog embryos are often studied to better understand how development works. ", "Amphibians can be found in folklore, fairy tales, and popular culture.

Scientists studying dangerous organisms such as Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, use special equipment that helps keep the organism from escap- ing the lab. ", "A field scientist studies an organism in a natural setting, which is not usually an indoor laboratory. Scientists who work outdoors are also required to follow safety regulations. These safety regulations are designed to prevent harm to themselves, other humans, animals, and the environment. If scientists work outside the country, they are required to learn about and follow the laws and restrictions of the country in which they are doing research. For example, entomologists following monarch butterfly  migrations between the United States and Mexico must follow regulations in both countries. Before biologists can study protected wildlife or plant species, they must apply for permission to do so, usually from the government. This is important to protect these fragile species. For example, if scientists collect rare butterflies, they must first get a permit. They must also be careful to not disturb the habitat.

They are most closely related to the caecilians, little-known legless amphibians . Most of the animals in the salamander order look like a cross between a lizard and a frog. They have moist, smooth skin like frogs and long tails like lizards. Salamanders are found in most moist or arid habitats in the Northern Hemisphere, but can also be found south of the equator. They live on all continents except Antarctica and Australia. Salamanders live in or near water or on moist ground, often in a swamp. Some species live in water most of their life, some live their entire adult life on land, and some live in both habitats. Some salamanders live in caves. These salamanders have pale skin and reduced eyes as they have adapted to living in complete darkness in underground pools of water. The reduced eyes are similar to other organisms that live in caves or underground. Salamanders are carnivorous, eating only other animals, not plants. They will eat almost any smaller animal, such as worms, centipedes, crickets, spiders, and slugs. Some will even eat small invertebrates. Finally, salamanders have the ability to grow back lost limbs, as well as other body parts. This process is known as regeneration. Salamanders have developed ways not to be eaten. Most salamanders have brightly colored, poisonous skin. The bold color tells predators not to eat the salamander. Many salamanders have glands on the back of the neck or on the tail that give off a poisonous or bad-tasting liquid. Some species can even shed their tail during an attack and grow a new one later. Some salamanders stand high on its legs and waves its tail to scare away danger. One particular salamander, the ribbed newt, has needle-like rib tips. It can squeeze its muscles to make the rib tips pierce through its skin and into its enemy, telling the predator to stay away, a feature unique among the animal kingdom. The marbled salamander (left) shows the typical salamander body plan: slender body, short legs, long tail, and moist skin. Caecilian (right) are a type of legless am- phibian most closely related to salaman- ders. ", "Different salamanders breathe in different ways. In those that have gills, breathing occurs through the gills as water passes over the gill slits. Sirens keep their gills all their lives, which allows them to breathe underwater. Species that live on land lose their gills as they grow older. These salamanders develop lungs that are used in breathing, much like breathing in mammals. Other land-living salamanders do not have lungs or gills. These are called lungless salamanders. Instead, they \"breathe,\" or exchange gases, through their skin. This requires blood vessels that exchange gases to be spread throughout the skin. ", "Salamanders are generally small. However, some can reach a foot or more, as in the mudpuppy of North America. In Japan and China, the giant salamander reaches 6 feet and weighs up to 66 pounds . ", "Salamanders belong to a group of approximately 500 species of amphibians. The order Urodela, containing sala- manders and newts, is divided into three suborders: 1. Giant salamanders, including the hellbender and Asiatic salamanders. 2. Advanced salamanders, including lungless salamanders, mudpuppies, and newts. Newts are salamanders that spend most of each year living on land. 3. Sirens. Sirens are salamanders that have lungs as well as gills and never develop beyond the larval stage. Sirens have only two legs, but the other salamander species develop four legs as adults, with fleshy toes at the end of each foot. The legs on four-legged salamanders are so short that the salamander belly drags on the ground as the animal walks. Sirens have long, strong tails that are flat to help sirens swim like a fish, with the tail swinging from side to side. The Pacific giant salamander can reach up to 6 feet in length and weigh up to 66 pounds.

Usually something measurable or \"quantifiable.\" 3. The data resulting from an experiment. For example, an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of the law of gravity. A bear skeleton in the woods would be evidence of the presence of bears. Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity . Of course water cannot be poured out of bottle and flow upward. The law of gravity is a scientific law, which is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature.

If many experiments are performed, and lots of evidence is collected in support of a general hypothesis, a scientific theory can be developed. Scientific theories are well established explanations of evidence, usually tested and confirmed by many different people. Scientific theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory, and no evidence disproving the theory. Scientific theories produce information that helps us understand our world. For example, the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientific theory. Scientists accept this theory as a fundamental principle of basic science. A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing. Thus, when scientists find new evidence, they can change their theories.

", "A scientist is always trying to find the truth and discover new truths. How can you think like a scientist? Thinking like a scientist is based on asking and answering questions. Though you may not know it, you do this all day long. Scientists ask questions, and then make detailed observations to try to ask more specific questions and develop a hypothesis. They may design and perform an experiment to try to answer their question and test their hypothesis. From the results of their experiment, scientists draw conclusions. A conclusion describes what the evidence tells the scientist. Scientists ask questions: The key to being a great scientist is to ask questions. Imagine you are a scientist in the African Congo. While in the field, you observe one group of healthy chimpanzees on the north side of the jungle. On the other side of the jungle, you find a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying. What questions might you ask? A good scientist might ask the following two questions: 1. \"What differs between the two environments where the chimpanzees live?\" 2. \"Are there differences in behavior between the two groups of chimpanzees?\" Scientists make detailed observations: To observe means to watch and study attentively. A person untrained in the sciences may only observe, \"The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying, while chimps on the other side of the jungle are healthy.\" A scientist, however, will make more detailed observations. Can you think of ways to make this observation more detailed? What about the number of chimps? Are they male or female? Young or old? What do they eat? A good scientist may observe, \"While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior, four female and five male chimps under the age of five on the south side have died.\" Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design their experiments and answer their questions. From these observations, a scientist will develop a hypothesis to explain the observations. A hypothesis is the scientists proposed explanation for his observations. The scientists hypothesis may be that \"Young chimps on the south side die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet.\" An adult and infant chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Scientists find answers using tests: When scientists want to answer a question, they search for evidence using experiments. An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong. Evidence is made up of the observations a scientist makes during an experiment. To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees, scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts, berries, and vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food. This test is the experiment. If fewer chimps die, then the experiment shows that the chimps may have died from not having enough food. This is the evidence. Scientists question the answers: Good scientists are skeptical. Scientists never use only one piece of evidence to form a conclusion. For example, the chimpanzees in the experiment may have died from a lack of food, but can you think of another explanation for their death? They may have died from a virus, or from another less obvious cause. More experiments need to be completed before scientists can be sure. Science is about finding the truth, no matter what. So good scientists constantly question their own conclusions. They also find other scientists to confirm or disagree with their evidence.

During what time of year does this happen? What causes it to happen? Plants can sense changes in the seasons. Leaves change color and drop each autumn in some climates . Certain flowers, like poinsettias, only bloom during the winter. And, in the spring, the winter buds on the trees break open, and the leaves start to grow. How do plants detect time of year? Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature, this is not the way in which plants know the seasons are changing. Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight, known as the photoperiod. Because of the tilt of the Earth, during winter days, there are less hours of light than during summer days. Thats why, in the winter, it starts getting dark very early in the evening, and then stays dark while youre getting ready for school the next morning. But in the summer it will be bright early in the morning, and the sun will not set until late that night. With a light-sensitive chemical, plants can sense the differences in day length. For example, in the fall, when the days start to get shorter, the trees sense that there is less sunlight. The plant is stimulated, and it sends messages telling the leaves to change colors and fall. This is an example of photoperiodism, the reaction of organisms, such as plants, to the length of day or night. Photoperiodism is also the reaction of plants to the length of light and dark periods. Many flowering plants sense the length of night, a dark period, as a signal to flower. Each plant has a different photoperiod, or night length. When the plant senses the appropriate length of darkness, resulting in an appropriate length of daylight, it flowers. Flowering plants are classified as long-day plants or short-day plants. Long-day plants flower when the length of daylight exceeds the necessary photoperiod, and short-day plants flower when the day length is shorter than the necessary photoperiod. Long-day plants include carnations, clover, lettuce, wheat, and turnips. Short-day plants include cotton, rice, and sugar cane.

How? Plants cant move on their own. So how does a plant start growing in a new area? ", "If youve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed, then you might realize that seeds are amazing structures. A seed is a plant ovule containing an embryo. The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts, harsh winters, and other conditions that would kill an adult plant. The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant, in a resting state, and wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow. In fact, some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years! Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the young plant after it sprouts. This greatly increases the chances that the tiny plant will survive. So being able to produce a seed is a beneficial adaptation, and, as a result, seed plants have been very successful. Although the seedless plants were here on Earth first, today there are many more seed plants than seedless plants. Learn more about seeds in the Seeds Massachusetts Institute of Technology video at ", "For a seed plant species to be successful, the seeds must be dispersed, or scattered around in various directions. If the seeds are spread out in many different areas, there is a better chance that some of the seeds will find the right conditions to grow. But how do seeds travel to places they have never been before? To aid with seed dispersal, some plants have evolved special features that help their seeds travel over long distances. One such strategy is to allow the wind to carry the seeds. With special adaptations in the seeds, the seeds can be carried long distances by the wind. For example, you might have noticed how the \"fluff\" of a dandelion moves in the wind. Each piece of fluff carries a seed to a new location. If you look under the scales of pine cone, you will see tiny seeds with \"wings\" that allow these seeds to be carried away by the wind. Maple trees also have specialized fruits with wing-like parts that help seed dispersal . Maple trees have fruits with wings that help the wind disperse the seeds. Some flowering plants grow fleshy fruit that helps disperse their seeds. When animals eat the fruit, the seeds pass through an animals digestive tract unharmed. The seeds germinate after they are passed out with the animals feces. Berries, citrus fruits, cherries, apples, and a variety of other types of fruits are all adapted to be attractive to animals, so the animals will eat them and disperse the seed . Some non-fleshy fruits are specially adapted for animals to carry them on their fur. You might have returned from a walk in the woods to find burrs stuck to your socks. These burrs are actually specialized fruits designed to carry seeds to a new location.

To live together with one another, these animals must be able to share information. ", "Some species of animals are very social. In these species, members of the group depend completely on one another. Different animals within the group have different jobs. Therefore, group members must work together for the good of all. Most species of ants and bees are highly social animals. Ants live together in large groups called colonies . A colony may have millions of ants, making communication among the ants very important. All of the ants in the colony work together as a single unit. Each ant has a specific job, and most of the ants are workers. Their job is to build and repair the colonys nest. Worker ants also leave the nest to find food for themselves and other colony members. The workers care for the young as well. Other ants in the colony are soldiers. They defend the colony against predators. Each colony also has a queen. Her only job is to lay eggs. She may lay millions of eggs each month. A few ants in the colony are called drones. They are the only male ants in the colony. Their job is to mate with the queen. Honeybees and bumblebees also live in colonies . Each bee in the colony has a particular job. Most of the bees are workers. Young worker bees clean the colonys hive and feed the young. Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive. The oldest workers leave the hive to find food. Each colony usually has one queen that lays eggs. The colony also has a small number of male drones. They mate with the queen. ", "Ants, bees, and other social animals must cooperate. Cooperation means working together with others. Members of the group may cooperate by sharing food. They may also cooperate by defending each other. Look at the ants pictured below . They show very clearly why cooperation is important. A single ant would not be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants. With cooperation, the job is easy. Animals in many other species cooperate. For example, lions live in groups called prides . All the lions in the pride cooperate, though there is still serious competition among the males. Male lions work together to defend the other lions in the pride. Female lions work together to hunt. Then, they share the meat with other pride members. Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats. Meerkats are small mammals that live in Africa. They also live in groups and cooperate with one another. For example, young female meerkats act as babysitters. They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are away looking for food. Members of this lion pride work together. Males cooperate by defending the pride. Females cooperate by hunting and shar- ing the food.

", "Some of the most interesting kinds of evidence for evolution are body parts that have lost their use through evolution . For example, most birds need their wings to fly. But the wings of an ostrich have lost their original use. Structures that have lost their use through evolution are called vestigial structures. They provide evidence for evolution because they suggest that an organism changed from using the structure to not using the structure, or using it for a different purpose. Penguins do not use their wings, known as flippers, to fly in the air. However, they do use them to move in the water. The theory of evolution suggests that penguins evolved to use their wings for a different purpose. A whales pelvic bones, which were once attached to legs, are also vestigial structures. Whales are descended from land-dwelling ancestors that had legs. Homologous structures are structures that have a common function and suggest common ancestry. For example, homologous structures include the limbs of mammals, such as bats, lions, whales, and humans, which all have a common ancestor. Different mammals may use their limbs for walking, running, swimming or flying. The method the mammal uses to move is considered a common function. ", "Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology, the study of how organisms develop. An embryo is an animal or plant in its earliest stages of development. This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born or hatched. Centuries ago, people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances. The embryos of some species are even difficult to tell apart. Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance until they develop further. Some unexpected traits can appear in animal embryos. For example, human embryos have gill slits just like fish! In fish they develop into gills, but in humans they disappear before birth. The presence of the gill slits suggests that a long time ago humans and fish shared a common ancestor. The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related and have common ancestors. For example, humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees. As our common ancestor evolved, humans and chimpanzees went down different evolutionary paths and developed different traits.

This is not the case. Ecosystems are \"dynamic.\" This means that ecosystems change over time. That forest may lie on land that was once covered by an ocean millions of years ago. Lightning may have sparked a fire in a forest, destroying much of the plant life there. Or the forest may have been cut down at one point for agricultural use, then abandoned and allowed to re-grow over time. During the ice ages, glaciers once covered areas that are tropical rainforests today. Both natural forces and human actions cause ecosystems to change. If there is a big ecosystem change caused by natural forces or human actions, the plants and animals that live there may be destroyed. Or they may be forced to leave. Over time, a new community will develop, and then that community may be replaced by another. You may see several changes in the plant and animal composition of the community over time. Ecological succession is the constant replacement of one community by another. It happens after a big change in the ecosystem. And, of course, succession occurs on brand new land. ", "Primary succession is the type of ecological succession that happens on new landslands where life has not yet existed. Primary succession can take place after lava flow cools and hardens into new land, or a glacier recedes exposing new land. Since the land that results from these processes is completely new land, soil must first be produced. How is soil produced? Primary succession always starts with a pioneer species. This is the species that first lives in the habitat. If life is to begin on barren rock, which is typical of new land, the pioneer species would be an organism such as a lichen . A lichen is actually an organism formed from two species. It results from a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria. The lichen is able to thrive as both the fungus and the algae or bacteria contribute to the relationship. The fungus is able to absorb minerals and nutrients from the rock, while algae supplies the fungus with sugars through photosynthesis. Since lichens can photosynthesize and do not rely on soil, they can live in environments where other organisms cannot. As a lichen grows, it breaks down the rock, which is the first step of soil formation. Primary succession on a rock often be- gins with the growth of lichens. What do lichens help create? The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations. Abiotic factors such as soil quality, water, and climate will determine the species that continue the process of succession. Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the newly created soil. During early succession, plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over the landscape. Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow. Slowly, the shrubs are replaced by small trees. Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees. Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses, a forest may be the end result of primary succession. ", "Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already existed. These areas already have soil full of nutrients. Secondary succession is the type of succession that happens after something destroys the habitat, such as a flood or other natural disaster. Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary succession . In this case, the pioneer species would be the grasses that first appear. Lichen would not be necessary as there is already nutrient-rich soil. Slowly, the field would return to its natural state. A forest fire can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs . Although the area will look devastated at first, the seeds of new plants are underground. They are waiting for their chance to grow. This land was once used for growing crops. Now that the field is abandoned, secondary succession has begun. Pio- neer species, such as grasses, appear first, and then shrubs begin to grow. Just like primary succession, the burned forest will go through a series of communities, starting with small grasses, then shrubs, and finally bigger trees. ", "A climax community  is the end result of ecological succession. The climax community is a stable balance of all organisms in an ecosystem, and will remain stable unless a disaster strikes. After the disaster, succession will start all over again. Depending on the climate of the area, the climax community will look different. In the tropics, the climax community might be a tropical rainforest. At the other extreme, in northern parts of the world, the climax community might be a coniferous forest. Though climax communities are stable, are they truly the final community of the habitat? Or is it likely that sometime in the future, maybe a long time in the future, the community of populations will change, and another stable, climax community will thrive?

At least one species will benefit in a symbiotic relationship. These relationships are often necessary for the survival of one or both organisms. There are three types of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, communalism, and parasitism. Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other is not affected. Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic species benefits while the host species is harmed. An example of a mutualistic relationship is between herbivores (plant-eaters) and the bacteria that live in their intestines. The bacteria get a place to live. Meanwhile, the bacteria help the herbivore digest food. Both species benefit, so this is a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish and the sea anemones also have a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from predators . Another example of this type of symbiotic relationship is the relationship between the plover bird and the African crocodile. The tiny blackbird acts as a toothpick for the fierce crocodile, and helps by removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodiles teeth. These food remains are the source of food for the bird. Another example is between the ostrich and the zebra. The ostrich always moves with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell, whereas the zebra has very sharp senses. The ostrich has a keen sense of sight, which the zebra lacks. Hence, these two species depend on each other to warn one another of any nearby imposing dangers. Commensal relationships may involve an organism using another for transportation or housing. For example, spiders build their webs on trees. The spider gets to live in the tree, but the tree is unaffected. Other commensal relationships exist between cattle egrets and livestock. Cattle egrets are mostly found in meadows and grasslands are always seen near cattle, horses and other livestock. These birds feed on the insects that come out of the field due to the movement of the animals. They even eat ticks, fleas, and other insects off the back of animals. The relationship between tigers and golden jackals is also commensalism. The jackal alerts the tiger to a kill and feeds on the remains of the prey left by the tiger. This is not a mutualistic relationship as the tiger does not provide anything to the jackal. Parasites may live either inside or on the surface of their host. An example of a parasite is a hookworm. Hookworms are roundworms that affect the small intestine and lungs of a host organism. They live inside of humans and cause them pain. However, the hookworms must live inside of a host in order to survive. Parasites may even kill the host they live on, but then they also kill their host organism, so this is rare. Parasites are found in animals, plants, and fungi. Hookworms are common in the moist tropic and subtropic regions. There is very little risk of getting a parasite in industrialized nations.

In the soil, fungi grow closely around the roots of plants, and they begin to help each other. The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling fungi are called mycorrhizae . As plants and fungi form a close relationship, the plant and the fungus feed one another. The plant provides sugars to the fungus that the plant makes through photosynthesis, which the fungus cannot do. The fungus then provides minerals and water to the roots of the plant. Since the plant and the fungus are helping each other out, this is a mutualistic relationship, a type of symbiosis known as mutualism. In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit. These roots (brown) and the mycorrhizae (white) help to feed one another. ", "Have you ever seen an organism called a lichen? Lichens are crusty, hard growths that you might find on trees, logs, walls, and rocks . Although lichens may not be the prettiest organisms in nature, they are unique. A lichen is really two organisms, sometimes referred to as a composite organism, that live very closely together: a fungus and a bacterium or an alga. The cells from the alga or bacterium live inside the fungus. Besides providing a home, the fungus also provides nutrients. In turn, the bacterium or the alga provides energy to the fungus by performing photosynthesis, obtaining energy directly from the sun. A lichen is also an example of a mutualistic relationship. Because lichens can grow on rocks, these organisms are some of the earliest life forms in new ecosystems. ", "Many insects have a symbiotic relationship with certain types of fungi: Ants and termites grow fungi in underground fungus gardens that they create. When the ants or termites have eaten a big meal of wood or leaves, they also eat some fungi from their gardens. The fungi help them digest the wood or leaves. The fungi secrete certain enzymes that the ants or termites cannot produce on their own. Ambrosia beetles live in the bark of trees. Like ants and termites, they grow fungi inside the bark of trees and use it to help digest their food. ", "Although lots of symbiotic relationships help both organisms, sometimes one of the organisms is harmed. When that happens, the organism that benefits, and is not harmed, is called a parasite. This type of relationship is known as parasitism. Examples of parasitic fungi include the following: Beginning in 1950, Dutch Elm trees in the United States began to die. Since then, most of these trees have been eliminated. The disease was caused by a fungus that acted as a parasite. The fungus that killed the trees was carried by beetles to the trees. Some parasitic fungi cause human diseases such as athletes foot and ringworm. These fungi feed on the outer layer of warm, moist skin. Though its name may suggest otherwise, ringworm is not caused by a worm, but by a fungus.

Evolution is usually so gradual that we do not see the change for many, many generations. The rate of evolution also depends on the generation time of a particular species. Not all organisms evolve at the same rate. Humans took millions of years to evolve from a mammal that is now extinct. It is very difficult to observe evolution in humans. However, there are organisms that are evolving so fast that you can observe evolution! A human takes about 22 years to go through one generation.

Charles Darwin came up with the idea of an evolutionary tree to represent the relationships between different species and their common ancestors . The base of the tree represents the ancient ancestors of all life. The separation into large branches shows where these original species evolved into new species. The branches keep splitting into smaller and smaller branches as species continue to evolve into more and more species. Some species are represented by short twigs spurting out of the tree, then stopping. These are species that went extinct before evolving into new species.

Water is drawn into the bivalve and washes over the gills. Mucus on the gills helps capture food and cilia transfer the food particles to the mouth. Once in the mouth, food passes into the stomach to be digested. Bivalves have a mouth, heart, intestine, gills, and stomach, but no head.

A biome is an area with similar populations of organisms. This can easily be seen with a community of plants and animals. Remember that a community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another. Different biomes, such as a forest  or a desert, obviously have different communities of plants and animals. How are the plants and animals different in the rainforest than those in the desert? Why do you think they are so different? The differences in the biomes are due to differences in the abiotic factors, especially climate. Climate is the typical weather in an area over a long period of time. The climate includes the amount of rainfall and the average temperature in the region. Obviously, the climate in the desert is much different than the climate in the rainforest. As a result, different types of plants and animals live in each biome. There are into two major groups of biomes: 1. Terrestrial biomes, which are land-based, such as deserts and forests. 2. Aquatic biomes, which are water-based, such as ponds and lakes. The abiotic factors, such as the amount of rainfall and the temperature, are going to influence other abiotic factors, such as the quality of the soil. This, in turn, is going to influence the plants that migrate into the ecosystem and thrive Tropical rainforest landscape in Hawaii. Notice how the plants are different from those in the desert. in that biome. Recall that migration is the movement of an organism into or out of a population. It can also refer to a whole new species moving into a habitat. The type of plants that live in a biome are going to attract a certain type of animal to that habitat. It is the interaction of the abiotic and biotic factors that describe a biome and ecosystem. In aquatic biomes, abiotic factors such as salt, sunlight and temperature play significant roles. For example, a hot dry biome is going to be completely different from a moderate wet biome. The soil quality will be different. Together, these will result in different plants being able to occupy each biome. Different plants will attract different animals (herbivores) to eat these plants. These animals, in turn, will attract different (carnivores) animals to eat the herbivores. So it is the abiotic factors that determine the biotic factors of an ecosystem, and together these define the biome.

The gases in Earths atmosphere exert pressure against everything they contact. The atmosphere rises high above Earths surface. It contains a huge number of individual gas particles. As a result, the pressure of the tower of air above a given spot on Earths surface is substantial.

According to Boyles law, if the temperature of a gas is held constant, increasing the volume of the gas decreases its pressure. Why is this the case? As the volume of a gas increases, its particles have more room to spread out. This means that there are fewer particles bumping into any given area. This decreases the pressure of the gas. The graph in Figure 4.12 shows this relationship between volume and pressure. Because pressure and volume change in opposite directions, their relationship is called an inverse relationship. You can see an animation of the relationship at this URL:  A scuba diver, like the one in Figure 4.13, releases air bubbles when he breathes under water. As he gets closer to the surface of the water, the air bubbles get bigger. Boyles law explains why. The pressure of the water decreases as the diver gets closer to the surface. Because the bubbles are under less pressure, they increase in volume even though the amount of gas in the bubbles remains the same. ", "Charless law was discovered in the 1700s by a French physicist named Jacques Charles. According to Charless law, if the pressure of a gas is held constant, increasing the temperature of the gas increases its volume. What happens when a gas is heated? Its particles gain energy. With more energy, the particles have a greater speed. Therefore, they can move more and spread out farther. The volume of the gas increases as it expands and takes up more space. The graph in Figure 4.14 shows this relationship between the temperature and volume of a gas. You can see an animation of the relationship at this URL:  . Roger had a latex balloon full of air inside his air-conditioned house. When he took the balloon outside in the hot sun, it got bigger and bigger until it popped. Charless law explains why. As the gas in the balloon warmed in the sun, its volume increased. It stretched and expanded the latex of the balloon until the balloon burst. ", "Amontons law was discovered in the late 1600s by a French physicist named Guillaume Amonton. According to Amontons law, if the volume of a gas is held constant, increasing the temperature of the gas increases its pressure. Why is this the case? A heated gas has more energy. Its particles move more and have more collisions, so the pressure of the gas increases. The graph in Figure 4.15 shows this relationship. A woman checked the air pressure in her tires before driving her car on a cold day . The tire pressure gauge registered 29 pounds of pressure per square inch. After driving the car several miles on the highway, the woman stopped and checked the tire pressure again. This time the gauge registered 32 pounds per square inch. Amontons law explains what happened. As the tires rolled over the road, they got warmer. The air inside the tires also warmed. As it did, its pressure increased.

Q: Denver, Colorado, is called the mile-high city because it is located 1 mile (1.6 km) above sea level. What is the average atmospheric pressure that high above sea level? A: From the Figure 1.1, the average atmospheric pressure 1.6 km above sea level is about 85 kPa. ", "There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases: density and depth of the atmosphere. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earths surface by gravity, so gas particles are denser near the surface. With more gas particles in a given volume, there are more collisions of particles and therefore greater pressure. The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes. With greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down from above. Therefore, air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude. On top of Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. ", "The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things, from sipping through a straw to simply breathing. You can see in the Figures 1.2 and 1.3 how we use air pressure in both of these ways.

What happens when the volume of air is constant and its temperature increases? Lawrence found out the answer to that question when he measured the air pressure in his tire. Increasing the temperature of a gas such as air, while holding its volume constant, increases the pressure of the gas. This relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas is called Amontons law. It was first proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s. Amontons gas law is just one of three commonly known gas laws. The other two are Boyles law and Charles law. Q: How does Amontons gas law explain the difference in air pressure in Lawrences tire?

Pressure is the amount of force exerted on a given area, such as pounds of force per square inch. When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This causes more collisions and greater pressure. Therefore, heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase.

When scientists communicate about their research, they may also get useful feedback from other scientists. For example, comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their findings in a different way. Other scientists can also repeat the research to see if they get the same results. Q: Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an investigation? A: If an investigation is repeated and different results are obtained, then it throws doubt on the original research. On the other hand, if the same results are obtained, scientists can place more confidence in them. ", "The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that scientists may communicate about their research. Some of the most common ways scientists communicate are listed below. You can think of scientific knowledge as a brick building, and the work of a single sci- entist as an individual brick. Considered by itself, the work of a single scientist may not seem that important, yet it may be an important piece of the overall structure. But unless a scientist communicates re- search results, that single brick may never be added to the building. Scientists may present papers about their research at scientific conferences. This is a good way to quickly reach an audience of other scientists who are most interested in the research topic. Scientists may publish articles about their research in peer-reviewed science journals. Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers, in other words, by other scientists. The articles are published only if the other scientists are convinced that the research is accurate and honest. Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their findings relate to matters of public policy, such as environmental pollution. Scientists may communicate about their research to the general public. For example, they might create a Web site about their research, blog about it, or write articles for newspapers or magazines. Q: Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about their research to the general public? Give an example. A: Communicating to the general public might be important if the research is directly related to peoples lives.

Most of them are concentrated close to Earths surface because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them. As a result, air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude. The Figure 1.3 shows how air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere.

Q: Why was Thales idea about natural causes such an important contribution to science? A: Natural causes can be investigated and understood, whereas gods or other supernatural causes are above nature and not suitable for investigation. Just a few hundred years after Thales, the Greek philosopher Aristotle made a very important contribution to science. You can see what Aristotle looked like in the Figure 1.1. Prior to Aristotle, other philosophers believed that they could find the truth about the natural world by inward reflectionin other words, just by thinking about it. Aristotle, in contrast, thought that truth about the natural world could come only from observations of nature and inductive reasoning. He argued that knowledge of nature must be based on evidence and logic. This idea is called empiricism, and it is the basis of science today. Aristotle introduced the idea of empiricism around 350 BCE. It is a hallmark of modern science. ", "In the first 1000 years CE, Europe went through a period called the Dark Ages. Science and learning in general were all but abandoned. However, in other parts of the world science flourished. During this period, some of the most important contributions to science were made by Persian scholars. For example, during the 700s CE, a Persian scientist named Geber introduced the scientific method and experimentation in chemistry. His ideas and methods were later adopted by European chemists. Today, Geber is known as the father of chemistry. ", "Starting in the mid-1500s, a scientific revolution occurred in Europe. This was the beginning of modern Western science. Many scientific advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years. The revolution in science began when Copernicus made the first convincing arguments that the sunnot Earthis the center of what we now call the solar system.  This was a drastic shift in thinking about Earths place in the cosmos. Around 1600, the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the telescope, which had just been invented, and made many important discoveries in the field of astronomy. Some of Galileos observations provided additional evidence for Copernicus sun-centered solar system. Q: Copernicus ideas about the solar system were so influential that the scientific revolution is sometimes called the Copernican revolution. Why do you think Copernicus ideas led to a revolution in science? A: Copernicus ideas about the solar system are considered to be the starting point of modern astronomy. They changed how all future scientists interpreted observations in astronomy. They also led to a flurry of new scientific investigation. Other contributions to science that occurred during the scientific revolution include: Keplers laws of planetary motion The model on the left shows what people believed about the solar system before Copernicus introduced the model on the right. Newtons law of universal gravitation Newtons three laws of motion ", "Another major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein (the rock star scientist pictured in the opening image). In 1916, Einstein published his general theory of relativity. This theory relates matter and energy. It also explains gravity as a property of space and time (rather than a property of matter as Newton thought). Einsteins theory has been supported by all evidence and observations to date, whereas Newtons law of gravity does not apply to all cases. Einsteins theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today. Q: How might Einsteins theory have influenced the course of science? A: Einsteins theory suggested new areas of investigation.

", "Some of the earliest scientific research on pressure in fluids was conducted by a French mathematician and physicist named Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). The SI unit of pressure, the Pascal (Pa), is named for him because of his important research. One of Pascals major contributions is known as Pascals law. This law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. ", "A simple example may help you understand Pascals law. Toothpaste is a fluid that is enclosed in a tube with a small opening at one end. Look at the toothpaste tube in the Figure 1.1. When any part of the tube is squeezed, toothpaste squirts out the open end. The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste. When the pressure reaches the open end, it forces toothpaste out through the opening. ", "The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very usefulbesides getting toothpaste out of a tube! For example, hydraulic brakes in a car use fluid to transmit pressure, and when they do, they also increase force. You can see how hydraulic brakes work in the Figure 1.2. A: The arrows representing the force applied by the break cylinder are larger than the arrow representing the force applied by the brake pedal mechanism. A larger arrow indicates greater force. Q: How do hydraulic brakes increase the force that is applied to the brake shoes? A: The pressure exerted by the fluid on the brake shoes is applied over a larger area. When pressure acts over a larger area, it increases the force (Force = Pressure  Area). Hydraulic car lifts also use fluid to transmit pressure and increase force. The lifts are used to raise cars, which are very heavy, so mechanics can work on them from underneath. Controls in airplanes use fluids to transmit pressure and increase force so a flick of a switch can raise or lower heavy landing gear.

URL:  Q: If you were to do an experiment to find out what influences the speed of an object down a ramp, what would be the responding variable? How could you measure it? A: The responding variable would be the speed of the object. You could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch. You could clock the time it takes the object to travel from the top to the bottom of the ramp. The less time it takes, the faster the average speed down the ramp. Q: What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp? A: Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the object. An example of a variable relating to the ramp is its steepness. An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it movesit might roll or slide down the ramp. Either of these variables could be manipulated by the researcher, so you could choose one of them for your manipulated variable. ", "Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment. You choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable. You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the bottom of the ramp. You decide to test two blocks on two ramps, one steeper than the other, and see which block reaches the bottom first. You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a rough board for the other ramp. You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope (see sketch below). You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner. Youre surprised, because you expected the block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom first. Q: What explains your result? A: The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom sooner if all else was equal. The problem is that all else was not equal. The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness. The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp, even though the rougher ramp was steeper. This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments: experimental controls. A control is a variable that must be held constant so it wont influence the outcome of an experiment. The control can be used as a standard for comparison between experiments. In the case of your ramp experiment, smoothness of the ramps should have been controlled by making each ramp out of the same material.

URL:  Q: What other variables do you think might influence the outcome of your ramp experiment? How could these other variables be controlled? A: Other variables might include variables relating to the block. For example, a smoother block would be expected to go down a ramp faster than a rougher block.

Because it is a broad explanation, it can explain many observations and pieces of evidence. In other words, it can help connect and make sense of many phenomena in the natural world. ", "A number of theories in science were first proposed many decades or even centuries ago, but they have withstood the test of time. An example of a physical science theory that has mainly withstood the test of time is Daltons atomic theory. John Dalton was a British chemist who lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Around 1800, he published his atomic theory, which is one of the most important theories in science. According to Daltons atomic theory, all substances consist of tiny particles called atoms. Furthermore, all the atoms of a given element are identical, whereas the atoms of different elements are always different. These parts of Daltons atomic theory are still accepted today, although some other details of his theory have since been disproven. Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence. For example, he studied many substances called compounds. These are substances that consist of two or more different elements. Dalton determined that a given compound always consists of the same elements in exactly the same proportions, no matter how small the sample of the compound. This idea is illustrated for the compound water in the Figure 1.1. Dalton concluded from this evidence that elements must be made up of tiny particles in order to always combine in the same specific proportions in any given compound. Water is a compound that consists of the elements hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). Like other compounds, the smallest particles of water are called molecules. Each molecule of water (H2 O) contains two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Q: Dalton thought that atoms are the smallest particles of matter. Scientists now know that atoms are composed of even smaller particles. Does this mean that the rest of Daltons atomic theory should be thrown out? A: The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesnt mean that we should scrap the entire theory. Atoms are still known to be the smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements. Also, it is atomsnot particles of atomsthat combine in fixed proportions in compounds. Instead of throwing out Daltons theory, scientists have refined and expanded on it. There are many other important physical science theories. Here are three more examples: Einsteins theory of gravity Kinetic theory of matter Wave-particle theory of light ", "The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony. The word parsimony means thriftiness. The law of parsimony states that, when choosing between competing theories, you should select the theory that makes the fewest assumptions. In other words, the simpler theory is more likely to be correct. For example, you probably know that Earth and the other planets of our solar system orbit around the sun. But several centuries ago, it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around Earth. While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according to this theory, the explanation is unnecessarily complex. Q: Why do you think parsimony is an important characteristic of scientific theories? A: The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific theory, the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect. If one assumption is wrong, so is the theory. Conversely, the theory that makes the fewest assumptions, assuming it is well supported by evidence, is most likely to be correct.

Lippershey used scientific knowledge of the properties of light and lenses to design his telescope. Lippersheys new technology quickly spread all over Europe. Almost immediately, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo started working to improve Lippersheys design. In just two years, Galileo had made a more powerful telescope. It could make very distant objects visible to the human eye. The Figure 1.2 shows Galileo demonstrating his powerful telescope. It appears to be focused on the moon. Galileo started using his telescope to explore the night sky. He soon made some remarkable discoveries. He observed hills and valleys on the moon and spots on the sun. He discovered that Jupiter has moons and that the sun rotates on its axis. With his discoveries, Galileo was able to prove that the sun, not Earth, is at the center of the solar system. This discovery played an important role in the history of science. It led to a scientific revolution that gave birth to modern Western science. And it all began with technology! Galileo is shown here presenting his tele- scope to government leaders. They must have been impressed. They gave him a life-long job as a university professor and doubled his salary.
