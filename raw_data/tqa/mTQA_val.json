Both occur suddenly. ", "A landslide happens when a large amount of soil and rock suddenly falls down a slope because of gravity. You can see an example in Figure 10.30. A landslide can be very destructive. It may bury or carry away entire villages. A landslide is more likely if the soil has become wet from heavy rains. The wet soil becomes slippery and heavy. Earthquakes often trigger landslides. The shaking ground causes soil and rocks to break loose and start sliding. If a landslide flows into a body of water, it may cause a huge wave called a tsunami. ", "A mudslide is the sudden flow of mud down a slope because of gravity. Mudslides occur where the soil is mostly clay. Like landslides, mudslides usually occur when the soil is wet. Wet clay forms very slippery mud that slides easily. You can see an example of a mudslide in Figure 10.31. ", "Two other types of mass movement are slump and creep. Both may move a lot of soil and rock. However, they usually arent as destructive as landslides and mudslides. ", "Slump is the sudden movement of large blocks of rock and soil down a slope. You can see how it happens in Figure 10.32. All the material moves together in big chunks. Slump may be caused by a layer of slippery, wet clay underneath the rock and soil on a hillside. Or it may occur when a river undercuts a slope. Slump leaves behind crescent-shaped scars on the hillside. ", "Creep is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside. Creep occurs so slowly you cant see it happening. You can only see the effects of creep after years of movement. This is illustrated in Figure 10.33. The slowly moving ground causes trees, fence posts, and other structures on the surface to tilt downhill. Creep usually takes place where the ground freezes and thaws frequently. Soil and rock particles are lifted up when the ground freezes. When the ground thaws, the particles settle down again. Each time they settle down, they move a tiny bit farther down the slope because of gravity.

Human actions that can increase soil erosion are described below. ", "The photos in Figure 19.2 show how farming practices can increase soil erosion. Plant roots penetrate the soil and keep it from eroding. Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and water. In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting. Some farmers now use no-till farming, which does not disturb the soil as much. The problem doesnt stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows, with bare soil in between the rows. In places where crops grow only during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months. ", "As you can see in Figure 19.3, some grazing animals, especially sheep and goats, eat grass right down to the roots. They may even pull the grass entirely out of the ground. Grazing animals can kill the grass or thin it out so much that it offers little protection to the soil. If animals are kept in the same place too long, the soil may become completely bare. The bare soil is easily eroded by wind and water. ", "Other human actions that put soil at risk include logging, mining, and construction. You can see examples of each in Figure 19.4. When forests are cut down, the soil is suddenly exposed to wind and rain. Without trees, there is no leaf litter to cover the ground and protect the soil. When leaf litter decays, it adds humus and nutrients to the soil. Mining and construction strip soil off the ground and leave the land bare. Paved roads and parking lots prevent rainwater from soaking into the ground. This increases runoff and the potential for soil erosion. ", "Even things that people do for fun can expose soil to erosion. For example, overuse of hiking trails can leave bare patches of soil. Off-road vehicles cause even more damage. You can see examples of this in Figure 19.5. ", "Soil is a renewable resource, but it can take thousands of years to form. Thats why people need to do what they can to prevent soil erosion. ", "The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and growing crops. This led to the development of new ways of farming that help protect the soil. Some of the methods are described in Figure 19.6. ", "There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss. Some of them are shown in Figure 19.7. Prevent overgrazing. Frequently move animals from field to field. This gives the grass a chance to recover. Avoid logging steep hillsides. Cut only a few trees in any given place. Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down. Reclaim mine lands. Save the stripped topsoil and return it to the land. Once the soil is in place, plant trees and other plants to protect the bare soil. Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at construction sites. Plant grass to hold the soil in place. Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff. Restrict the use of off-road vehicles, especially in hilly areas.

Several tsunami waves were created with about 30 minutes between the peaks of each one. The waves that struck nearby Sumatra 15 minutes after the quake reached more than 10 meters (33 feet) in height. The size of the waves decreased with distance from the earthquake and were about 4 meters (13 feet) high in Somalia. The tsunami did so much damage because it traveled throughout the Indian Ocean.

When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies. ", "About 13.7 billion years ago, the entire universe was packed together. Everything was squeezed into a tiny volume. Then there was an enormous explosion. After this big bang, the universe expanded rapidly . All of the matter and energy in the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists have evidence this is how the universe formed. One piece of evidence is that we see galaxies moving away from us. If they are moving apart, they must once have been together. Also, there is energy left over from this explosion throughout the universe. The theory for the origin of the universe is called the Big Bang Theory. ", "In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became less dense. It began to cool. First protons, neutrons, and electrons formed. From these particles came hydrogen. Nuclear fusion created helium atoms. Some parts of the universe had matter that was densely packed. Enormous clumps of matter were held together by gravity. Eventually this material became the gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and other structures that we see in the universe today. ", "We see many objects out in space that emit light. This matter is contained in stars, and the stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter. Dark matter doesnt emit light, so we cant see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see. What is dark matter? Actually, we dont really know. Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth. The universe could contain lots of objects that dont have enough mass to glow on their own. There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe. ", "We know that the universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity. Would the universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday start to contract? This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite of the Big Bang. Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding even faster than before. What is causing the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the universe that we cant see. Astronomers call this dark energy. We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter.

", "Scientists study meteorites to learn about Earths interior. Meteorites formed in the early solar system. These objects represent early solar system materials. Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel. They are thought to be very similar to Earths core . An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can hold in their hands! ", "Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition. Its understandable that scientists know the most about the crust, and less about deeper layers . Earths crust is a thin, brittle outer shell. The crust is made of rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges. ", "There are two kinds of crust. Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor. ", "Continental crust is much thicker than oceanic crust. It is 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average, but it varies a lot. Continental crust is made up of many different rocks. All three major rock types  igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary  are found in the crust. On average, continental crust is much less dense (2.7 g/cm3) than oceanic crust. Since it is less dense, it rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust. ", "Beneath the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects . The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. Hot lower mantle material rises upwards . As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is convection. The motion described creates a convection cell. ", "The dense, iron core forms the center of the Earth. Scientists know that the core is metal from studying metallic meteorites and the Earths density. Seismic waves show that the outer core is liquid, while the inner core is solid. Movement within Earths outer liquid iron core creates Earths magnetic field. These convection currents form in the outer core because the base of the outer core is heated by the even hotter inner core. ", "Lithosphere and asthenosphere are layers based on physical properties. The outermost layer is the lithosphere. The lithosphere is the crust and the uppermost mantle. In terms of physical properties, this layer is rigid, solid, and brittle. It is easily cracked or broken. Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is also in the upper mantle. This layer is solid, but it can flow and bend. A solid that can flow is like silly putty.

Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions. The sound waves bounce off the nearest object, and then return to the ship. Scientists know the speed of sound in seawater. They then can calculate the distance to the object that the sound wave hit. Most of these sound waves did not hit submarines. They instead were used to map the ocean floor. ", "Scientists were surprised to find huge mountains and deep trenches when they mapped the seafloor. The mid-ocean ridges form majestic mountain ranges through the deep oceans . Deep sea trenches are found near chains of active volcanoes. These volcanoes can be at the edges of continents or in the oceans. Trenches are the deepest places on Earth. The deepest trench is the Mariana Trench in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. This trench plunges about 11 kilometers (35,840 feet) beneath sea level. The ocean floor does have lots of flat areas. These abyssal plains are like the scientists had predicted. ", "Warships also carried magnetometers. They were also used to search for submarines. The magnetometers also revealed a lot about the magnetic properties of the seafloor. ", "Indeed, scientists discovered something astonishing. Many times in Earths history, the magnetic poles have switched positions. North becomes south and south becomes north! When the north and south poles are aligned as they are now, geologists say it is normal polarity. When they are in the opposite position, they say that it is reversed polarity. ", "Scientists were also surprised to discover a pattern of stripes of normal and reversed polarity. These stripes surround the mid-ocean ridges. There is one long stripe with normal magnetism at the top of the ridge. Next to that stripe are two long stripes with reversed magnetism. One is on either side of the normal stripe. Next come two normal stripes and then two reversed stripes, and so on across the ocean floor. The magnetic stripes end abruptly at the edges of continents. Sometimes the stripes end at a deep sea trench . ", "The scientists used geologic dating techniques on seafloor rocks. They found that the youngest rocks on the seafloor were at the mid-ocean ridges. The rocks get older with distance from the ridge crest. The scientists were surprised to find that the oldest seafloor is less than 180 million years old. This may seem old, but the oldest continental crust is around 4 billion years old. Scientists also discovered that the mid-ocean ridge crest is nearly sediment free. The crust is also very thin there. With distance from the ridge crest, the sediments and crust get thicker. This also supports the idea that the youngest rocks are on the ridge axis and that the rocks get older with distance away from the ridge . Something causes the seafloor to be created at the ridge crest. The seafloor is also destroyed in a relatively short time. ", "The seafloor spreading hypothesis brought all of these observations together in the early 1960s. Hot mantle material rises up at mid-ocean ridges. The hot magma erupts as lava. The lava cools to form new seafloor. Later, more lava erupts at the ridge. The new lava pushes the seafloor that is at the ridge horizontally away from ridge axis. The seafloor moves! In some places, the oceanic crust comes up to a continent. The moving crust pushes that continent away from the ridge axis as well. If the moving oceanic crust reaches a deep sea trench, the crust sinks into the mantle. The creation and destruction of oceanic crust is the reason that continents move. Seafloor spreading is the mechanism that Wegener was looking for!

The East Pacific Rise is a divergent plate boundary in the Pacific Ocean . The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a divergent plate boundary in the Atlantic Ocean. Continents can also rift apart. When mantle gets close enough to the surface, volcanoes form. Eventually, a rift valley will create a new mid-ocean ridge. ", "Lots of volcanoes form along subduction plate boundaries. The edges of the Pacific Plate are a long subduction boundary. Lines of volcanoes can form at subduction zones on oceanic or continental crust. Japan is an example of a volcanic arc on oceanic crust. The Cascade Range and Andes Mountains are volcanic arcs on continental crust. ", "Some volcanoes form over active hot spots. Scientists count about 50 hot spots on the Earth. Hot spots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate. Hot spots lie directly above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume. Mantle plumes continuously bring magma up from the mantle towards the crust . As the tectonic plates move above a hot spot, they form a chain of volcanoes. The islands of Hawaii formed over a hot spot in the middle of the Pacific plate. The Hawaii hot spot has been active for tens of millions of years. The volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands formed at this hot spot. Older volcanoes that formed at the hot spot have eroded below sea level. These are called the Emperor Seamounts. Loihi seamount is currently active beneath the water southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. One day the volcano will rise above sea level and join the volcanoes of the island or create a new island . Hot spots may also be active at plate boundaries. This is especially common at mid-ocean ridges. Iceland is formed by a hot spot along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Hot spots are found within continents, but not as commonly as within oceans. The Yellowstone hot spot is a famous example of a continental hot spot.

Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top. The crater was created during the volcanos last eruption. Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash . The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions. The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes. ", "Shield volcanoes look like a huge ancient warriors shield laid down. Figure 8.16 shows the Kilaeua Volcano. A shield volcano has a very wide base. It is much flatter on the top than a composite volcano. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is reltively thin. The thin lava spreads out. This builds a large, flat volcano layer by layer. Shield volcanoes are very large. For example, the Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The top of nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its base on the seafloor. Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries. They also form at hot spots, like Hawaii. Shield volcano eruptions are non-explosive. ", "Cinder cones are the smallest and most common type of volcano. Cinder cones have steep sides like composite volcanoes. But they are much smaller, rarely reaching even 300 meters in height. Cinder cones usually have a crater at the summit. Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, called cinders. The cinders are piled on top of one another. These volcanoes usually do not produce streams of lava. Cinder cones often form near larger volcanoes. Most composite and shield volcanoes have nearby cinder cones. Cinder cones usually build up very rapidly. They only erupt for a short time. Many only produce one eruption. For this reason, cinder cones do not reach the sizes of stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes . ", "During a massive eruption all of the material may be ejected from a magma changer. Without support, the mountain above the empty chamber may collapse. This produces a huge caldera. Calderas are generally round, bowl-shaped formations like the picture in Figure 8.18. ", "Supervolcanoes are the most dangerous type of volcano. During an eruption, enormous amounts of ash are thrown into the atmosphere. The ash encircles the globe. This blocks the Sun and lowers the temperature of the entire planet. The result is a volcanic winter. A supervolcano eruption took place at Lake Toba in northern Sumatra about 75,000 years ago . This was the largest eruption in the past 25 million years. As much as 2,800 cubic kilometers of material was ejected into the atmosphere. The result was a 6- to 10-year volcanic winter. Some scientists think that only 10,000 humans survived worldwide. The numbers of other mammals also plummeted. The most recent supervolcano eruption was in New Zealand. The eruption was less than 2000 years ago. For a supervolcano eruption it was small, about 100 cubic kilometers of material. A much larger super eruption in Colorado produced over 5,000 cubic kilometers of material. That eruption was 28 million years ago. It was 5000 times larger than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. The largest potentially active supervolcano in North America is Yellowstone. The caldera has had three super eruptions at 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago. The floor of the Yellowstone caldera is slowly rising upwards. Another eruption is very likely but no one knows when. The cause of supervolcano eruptions is being debated. Enormous magma chambers are filled with super hot magma. This enormous eruption leaves a huge hole. The ground collapses and creates a caldera.

Still, in many areas of the world, the rate of soil erosion is many times greater than the rate at which it is forming. Drought, insect plagues, or outbreaks of disease are natural cycles of events that can negatively impact ecosystems and the soil, but there are also many ways in which humans neglect or abuse this important resource. Soils can also be contaminated if too much salt accumulates in the soil or where pollutants sink into the ground. One harmful practice is removing the vegetation that helps to hold soil in place. Sometimes just walking or riding your bike over the same place will kill the grass that normally grows there. Land is also deliberately cleared or deforested for wood. The loose soils then may be carried away by wind or running water. A farmer and his sons walk through a dust storm in Cimarron County, Oklahoma in 1936. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

", "Adding organic material to the soil in the form of plant or animal waste, such as compost or manure, increases the fertility of the soil and improves its ability to hold on to water and nutrients . Inorganic fertilizer can also temporarily increase the fertility of a soil and may be less expensive or time consuming, but it does not provide the same long-term improvements as organic materials. ", "Soil is a natural resource that is vitally important for sustaining natural habitats and for growing food. Although soil is a renewable resource, it is renewed slowly, taking hundreds or thousands of years for a good fertile soil to develop. Organic material can be added to soil to help increase its fertility. Most of the best land for farming is already being cultivated. With human populations continuing to grow, it is extremely important to protect our soil resources. Agricultural practices such as rotating crops, alternating the types of crops planted in each row, and planting nutrient-rich cover crops all help to keep soil more fertile as it is used season after season. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of the field, or building terraces into steeper slopes will all help to hold soil in place . No-till or low-tillage farming helps to keep soil in place by disturbing the ground as little as possible when planting. Steep slopes can be terraced to make level planting areas and decrease surface water runoff and erosion. The rate of topsoil loss in the United States and other developed countries has decreased recently as better farming practices have been adopted. Unfortunately, in developing nations, soil is often not protected. Table 1.1 shows some steps that we can take to prevent erosion. Some are things that can be done by farmers or developers. Others are things that individual homeowners or community members can implement locally. Source of Erosion Strategies for Prevention Leave leaf litter on the ground in the winter. Grow cover crops, special crops grown in the winter to cover the soil. Plant tall trees around fields to buffer the effects of wind. Drive tractors as little as possible. Use drip irrigation that puts small amounts of water in the ground frequently. Avoid watering crops with sprinklers that make big water drops on the ground. Keep fields as flat as possible to avoid soil erod- ing down hill. Grazing Animals Move animals throughout the year, so they dont consume all the vegetation in one spot. Keep animals away from stream banks, where hills are especially prone to erosion. Logging and Mining Reduce the amount of land that is logged and mined. Reduce the number of roads that are built to access logging areas. Avoid logging and mining on steep lands. Cut only small areas at one time and quickly replant logged areas with new seedlings. Development Reduce the amount of land area that is developed into urban areas, parking lots, etc. Keep as much green space in cities as possible, such as parks or strips where plants can grow. Invest in and use new technologies for parking lots that make them permeable to water in order to reduce runoff of water. Recreational Activities Avoid using off-road vehicles on hilly lands. Stay on designated trails. Avoid building on steep hills. Grade surrounding land to distribute water rather than collecting it in one place. Where water collects, drain to creeks and rivers.

During the Pleistocene ice ages, which began 2.6 million years ago, glaciers advanced and retreated four times . During the retreats, the climate was often warmer than it is today. Glacial ice at its maximum during the Pleistocene. These continental ice sheets were extremely thick, like the Antarctic ice cap is today. The Pleistocene ice ages guided the evolution of life in the Cenozoic, including the evolution of humans.

Chemical weathering works through chemical reactions that cause changes in the minerals. ", "Most minerals form at high pressure or high temperatures deep in the crust, or sometimes in the mantle. When these rocks are uplifed onto Earths surface, they are at very low temperatures and pressures. This is a very different environment from the one in which they formed and the minerals are no longer stable. In chemical weathering, minerals that were stable inside the crust must change to minerals that are stable at Earths surface. ", "Remember that the most common minerals in Earths crust are the silicate minerals. Many silicate minerals form in igneous or metamorphic rocks. The minerals that form at the highest temperatures and pressures are the least stable at the surface. Clay is stable at the surface and chemical weathering converts many minerals to clay . There are many types of chemical weathering because there are many agents of chemical weathering. Deforestation in Brazil reveals the under- lying clay-rich soil. ", "A water molecule has a very simple chemical formula, H2 O, two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. But water is pretty remarkable in terms of all the things it can do. Remember that water is a polar molecule. The positive side of the molecule attracts negative ions and the negative side attracts positive ions. So water molecules separate the ions from their compounds and surround them. Water can completely dissolve some minerals, such as salt. Weathered rock in Walnut Canyon near Flagstaff, Arizona. Hydrolysis is the name of the chemical reaction between a chemical compound and water. When this reaction takes place, water dissolves ions from the mineral and carries them away. These elements have been leached. Through hydrolysis, a mineral such as potassium feldspar is leached of potassium and changed into a clay mineral. Clay minerals are more stable at the Earths surface. ", "Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) combines with water as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. This makes a weak acid, called carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is a very common in nature, where it works to dissolve rock. Pollutants, such as sulfur and nitrogen from fossil fuel burning, create sulfuric and nitric acid. Sulfuric and nitric acids are the two main components of acid rain, which accelerates chemical weathering . Acid rain is discussed in the chapter Human Impacts on Earths Systems. This statue at Washington Square Arch in New York City exhibits damage from acid rain. ", "Oxidation is a chemical reaction that takes place when oxygen reacts with another element. Oxygen is very strongly chemically reactive. The most familiar type of oxidation is when iron reacts with oxygen to create rust . Minerals that are rich in iron break down as the iron oxidizes and forms new compounds. Iron oxide produces the red color in soils.

If the humidity today is 80%, it means that the air contains 80% of the total amount of water it can hold at that temperature. What will happen if the humidity increases to more than 100%? The excess water condenses and forms precipitation. Since warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air, raising or lowering temperature can change airs relative humidity . The temperature at which air becomes saturated with water is called the airs dew point. This term makes sense, because water condenses from the air as dew if the air cools down overnight and reaches 100% humidity. This diagram shows the amount of water air can hold at different temperatures. The temperatures are given in degrees Cel- sius. ", "Water vapor is not visible unless it condenses to become a cloud. Water vapor condenses around a nucleus, such as dust, smoke, or a salt crystal. This forms a tiny liquid droplet. Billions of these water droplets together make a cloud.

(2) Humidity remains the same, but temperature decreases. When the air cools enough to reach 100% humidity, water droplets form. Air cools when it comes into contact with a cold surface or when it rises.

For this reason, cloudy days tend to have a lower range of temperatures than clear days. ", "Clouds are classified in several ways. The most common classification used today divides clouds into four separate cloud groups, which are determined by their altitude . The four cloud types and where they are found in the atmosphere. High clouds form from ice crystals where the air is extremely cold and can hold little water vapor. Cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus are all names of high clouds. Middle clouds, including altocumulus and altostratus clouds, may be made of water droplets, ice crystals or both, depending on the air temperatures. Thick and broad altostratus clouds are gray or blue-gray. They often cover the entire sky and usually mean a large storm, bearing a lot of precipitation, is coming. Low clouds are nearly all water droplets. Stratus, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus clouds are common low clouds. Nimbostratus clouds are thick and dark. They bring steady rain or snow. Vertical clouds, clouds with the prefix \"cumulo-,\" grow vertically instead of horizontally and have their bases at low altitude and their tops at high or middle altitude. Clouds grow vertically when strong air currents are rising upward. Precipitating clouds are nimbus clouds. ", "Fog  is a cloud located at or near the ground . When humid air near the ground cools below its dew point, fog is formed. Each type of fog forms in a different way. Radiation fog forms at night when skies are clear and the relative humidity is high. As the ground cools, the bottom layer of air cools below its dew point. Tule fog is an extreme form of radiation fog found in some regions. San Francisco, California, is famous for its summertime advection fog. Warm, moist Pacific Ocean air blows over the cold California current and cools below its dew point. Sea breezes bring the fog onshore. Steam fog appears in autumn when cool air moves over a warm lake. Water evaporates from the lake surface and condenses as it cools, appearing like steam.

However, scientists think that matter that emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter, about 80%, is dark matter. Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation, so we cant observe it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter exists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it. When astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find that the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than they can see. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is bent from a very distant bright source around a super-massive object . To explain strong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be present. With so little to go on, astronomers dont really know much about the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just be ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs  objects larger than Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. But astronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which they have named MACHOs (massive astrophyiscal compact halo object), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be only a small part of the total.

If yes, then the universe will expand forever, although the expansion will slow down over time. If no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang. Recently, astronomers have made a discovery that answers that question: the rate at which the universe is expanding is actually increasing. In other words, the universe is expanding faster now than ever before, and in the future it will expand even faster. So now astronomers think that the universe will keep expanding forever. But it also proposes a perplexing new question: what is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new, hypothetical form of energy called dark energy .

Today matter makes up a small percentage of the universe, but at the start of the universe it made up much more. Where did dark energy, if it even exists, come from?

Conduction: Heat is transferred through rapid collisions of atoms, which can only happen if the material is solid. Heat flows from warmer to cooler places until all are the same temperature. The mantle is hot mostly because of heat conducted from the core. Peridotite is formed of crystals of olivine (green) and pyroxene (black). 2. Convection: If a material is able to move, even if it moves very slowly, convection currents can form. Convection in the mantle is the same as convection in a pot of water on a stove. Convection currents within Earths mantle form as material near the core heats up. As the core heats the bottom layer of mantle material, particles move more rapidly, decreasing its density and causing it to rise. The rising material begins the convection current. When the warm material reaches the surface, it spreads horizontally. The material cools because it is no longer near the core. It eventually becomes cool and dense enough to sink back down into the mantle. At the bottom of the mantle, the material travels horizontally and is heated by the core. It reaches the location where warm mantle material rises, and the mantle convection cell is complete . Convection.

E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a primitive prokaryote that may resemble the earliest cells. For an organic molecule to become a cell, it must be able to separate itself from its environment. To enclose the molecule, a lipid membrane grew around the organic material. Eventually the molecules could synthesize their own organic material and replicate themselves. These became the first cells. ", "The earliest cells were prokaryotes . Although prokaryotes have a cell membrane, they lack a cell nucleus and other organelles. Without a nucleus, RNA was loose within the cell. Over time the cells became more complex. LUCA was a prokaryote but differed from the first living cells because its genetic code was based on DNA. The oldest fossils are tiny microbe-like objects that are 3.5 billion years old. Evidence for bacteria, the first single-celled life forms, goes back 3.5 billion years . ", "The earliest life forms did not have the ability to photosynthesize. Without photosynthesis what did the earliest cells eat? Most likely they absorbed the nutrients that floated around in the organic soup that surrounded them. After hundreds of millions of years, these nutrients would have become less abundant. Sometime around 3 billion years ago (about 1.5 billion years after Earth formed!), photosynthesis began. Photo- synthesis allowed organisms to use sunlight and inorganic molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water, to create chemical energy that they could use for food. To photosynthesize, a cell needs chloroplasts . A diagram of a bacterium. Chloroplasts are visible in these cells found within a moss. ", "In what two ways did photosynthesis make the planet much more favorable for life? 1. Photosynthesis allowed organisms to create food energy so that they did not need to rely on nutrients floating around in the environment. Photosynthesizing organisms could also become food for other organisms. 2. A byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen. When photosynthesis evolved, all of a sudden oxygen was present in large amounts in the atmosphere. For organisms used to an anaerobic environment, the gas was toxic, and many organisms died out.

The oldest known fossils that are from organisms known to photosynthesize are cyanobac- teria. Cyanobacteria were present by 2.8 billion years ago, and some may have been around as far back as 3.5 billion years. Cyanobacteria were the dominant life forms in the Archean. Why would such a primitive life-form have been dominant in the Precambrian? Many cyanobacteria lived in reef-like structures known as stromatolites (Figure These rocks in Glacier National Park, Montana may contain some of the oldest fossil microbes on Earth.

Mafic magmas are low in silica and contain more dark, magnesium- and iron-rich mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene. Felsic magmas are higher in silica and contain lighter colored minerals such as quartz and orthoclase feldspar. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher is its viscosity. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flow. Viscosity determines what the magma will do. Mafic magma is not viscous and will flow easily to the surface. Felsic magma is viscous and does not flow easily. Most felsic magma will stay deeper in the crust and will cool to form igneous intrusive rocks such as granite and granodiorite. If felsic magma rises into a magma chamber, it may be too viscous to move, so it gets stuck. Dissolved gases become trapped by thick magma. The magma churns in the chamber and the pressure builds.

Many minerals start out in liquids that are hot enough to melt rocks. Magma is melted rock inside Earth, a molten mixture of substances that can be hotter than 1,000 C. Magma cools slowly inside Earth, which gives mineral crystals time to grow large enough to be seen clearly . Granite is rock that forms from slowly cooled magma, containing the minerals quartz (clear), plagioclase feldspar (shiny white), potassium feldspar (pink), and bi- otite (black). When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is called lava. Lava cools much more rapidly than magma. Crystals do not have time to form and are very small. The chemical composition between minerals that form rapidly or slowly is often the same, only their size differs. Existing rocks may be heated enough so that the molecules are released from their structure and can move around. The molecules may match up with different molecules to form new minerals as the rock cools. This occurs during metamorphism, which will be discussed in the \"Metamorphic Rocks\" concept. ", "Water on Earth, such as the water in the oceans, contains chemical elements mixed into a solution. Various processes can cause these elements to combine to form solid mineral deposits. ", "When water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid precipitate of minerals, as shown in Figure 1.2. When the water in glass A evaporates, the dissolved mineral particles are left behind. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved minerals and salts. When the amount is too great to stay dissolved in the water, the particles come together to form mineral solids, which sink. Halite easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California  or The Great Salt Lake in Utah, contain many mineral precipitates. Tufa towers form when calcium-rich spring water at the bottom of Mono Lake bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The tufa towers appear when lake level drops. ", "Magma heats nearby underground water, which reacts with the rocks around it to pick up dissolved particles. As the water flows through open spaces in the rock and cools, it deposits solid minerals. The mineral deposits that form when a mineral fills cracks in rocks are called veins . Quartz veins formed in this rock. When minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals form . Amethyst formed when large crystals grew in open spaces inside the rock. These special rocks are called geodes. ", "In the last several years, many incredible discoveries have been made exploring how minerals behave under high pressure, like rocks experience inside the Earth. If a mineral is placed in a special machine and then squeezed, eventually it may convert into a different mineral. Ice is a classic example of a material that undergoes solid-solid \"phase transitions\" as pressure and/or temperature is changed. A \"phase diagram\" is a graph which plots the stability of phases of a compound as a function of pressure and temperature. A phase diagram for water (ice) is included in the Figure 1.6. The phase diagram is split up into 3 main areas for the solid crystalline phase (ice), the liquid phase (water), and the gas phase (water vapor). Notice that increasing pressure lowers the freezing point and raises the boiling point of water. What does that do to the stability conditions of the liquid phase? A sample phase diagram for water.

Feldspar and quartz are the two most common silicate minerals. Both are extremely common rock-forming minerals. The basic building block for all silicate minerals is the silica tetrahedron, which is illustrated in Figure 1.1. To create the wide variety of silicate minerals, this pyramid-shaped structure is often bound to other elements, such as calcium, iron, and magnesium. Silica tetrahedrons combine together in six different ways to create different types of silicates . Tetrahe- drons can stand alone, form connected circles called rings, link into single and double chains, form large flat sheets of pyramids, or join in three dimensions. One silicon atom bonds to four oxygen atoms to form a silica tetrahedron. The different ways that silica tetrahedrons can join together cause these two minerals to look very different.

It must be crystalline, meaning it has a repeating arrangement of atoms. It must be naturally occurring. It must be inorganic. It must have a specific chemical composition. Minerals can be identified by their physical properties, such as hardness, color, luster (shininess), and odor. The most common laboratory technique used to identify a mineral is X-ray diffraction (XRD), a technique that involves shining an X-ray light on a sample, and observing how the light exiting the sample is bent. XRD is not useful in the field, however. The definition of a mineral is more restricted than you might think at first. For example, glass is made of sand, which is rich in the mineral quartz. But glass is not a mineral, because it is not crystalline. Instead, glass has a random assemblage of molecules. What about steel? Steel is made by mixing different metal minerals like iron, cobalt, chromium, vanadium, and molybdenum, but steel is not a mineral because it is made by humans and therefore is not naturally occurring. However, almost any rock you pick up is composed of minerals. Below we explore the qualities of minerals in more detail. ", "Minerals are \"crystalline\" solids. A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. Notice that in Figure 1.1 the green and purple spheres, representing sodium and chlorine, form a repeating pattern. In this case, they alternate in all directions. Sodium ions (purple balls) bond with chlo- ride ions (green balls) to make table salt (halite). All of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker have this crystalline structure. ", "Organic substances are the carbon-based compounds made by living creatures and include proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. Inorganic substances have a structure that is not characteristic of living bodies. Coal is made of plant and animal remains. Is it a mineral? Coal is a classified as a sedimentary rock, but is not a mineral. ", "Minerals are made by natural processes, those that occur in or on Earth. A diamond created deep in Earths crust is a mineral, but a diamond made in a laboratory by humans is not. Be careful about buying a laboratory-made diamond for jewelry. It may look pretty, but its not a diamond and is not technically a mineral. ", "Nearly all (98.5%) of Earths crust is made up of only eight elements - oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium - and these are the elements that make up most minerals. All minerals have a specific chemical composition. The mineral silver is made up of only silver atoms and diamond is made only of carbon atoms, but most minerals are made up of chemical compounds. Each mineral has its own chemical formula. Table salt (also known as halite), pictured in Figure 1.1, is NaCl (sodium chloride). Quartz is always made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey), represented by the chemical formula SiO2 . Quartz is made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey). In nature, things are rarely as simple as in the lab, and so it should not come as a surprise that some minerals have a range of chemical compositions. One important example in Earth science is olivine, which always has silicon and oxygen as well as some iron and magnesium, (Mg, Fe)2 SiO4 . ", "Some minerals can be identified with little more than the naked eye. We do this by examining the physical properties of the mineral in question, which include: Color: the color of the mineral. Streak: the color of the minerals powder (this is often different from the color of the whole mineral). Luster: shininess. Density: mass per volume, typically reported in \"specific gravity,\" which is the density relative to water. Cleavage: the minerals tendency to break along planes of weakness.

Those mountains rose at the convergent plate boundaries where the continents were smashing together to create Pangaea. As Pangaea came together about 300 million years ago, the continents were separated by an ocean where the Atlantic is now. The proto-Atlantic ocean shrank as the Pacific Ocean grew. The Appalachian mountains of eastern North America formed at a convergent plate boundary as Pangaea came together . About 200 million years ago, the they were probably as high as the Himalayas, but they have been weathered and eroded significantly since the breakup of Pangaea. Pangaea has been breaking apart since about 250 million years ago. Divergent plate boundaries formed within the continents to cause them to rift apart. The continents are still moving apart, since the Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. If the continents continue in their current directions, they will come together to create a supercontinent on the other side of the planet in around 200 million years. If you go back before Pangaea there were earlier supercontinents, such as Rodinia, which existed 750 million to 1.1 billion years ago, and Columbia, at 1.5 to 1.8 billion years ago. This supercontinent cycle is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see and many more that are long gone . Scientists think that the creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years. The supercontinent before Pangaea was Rodinia.

Of course, winter is also the stormy season in many locations, so wind and rain are available to wash soil away. Tractor tires make deep grooves, which are natural pathways for water.

Logging results in the loss of leaf litter, or dead leaves, bark, and branches on the forest floor. Leaf litter plays an important role in protecting forest soils from erosion . Logging exposes large areas of land to erosion. Much of the worlds original forests have been logged. Many of the tropical forests that remain are currently the site of logging because North America and Europe have already harvested many of their trees . Soils eroded from logged forests clog rivers and lakes, fill estuaries, and bury coral reefs. Surface mining disturbs the land  and leaves the soil vulnerable to erosion.

", "Scientists know that climate is the most important factor determining soil type because, given enough time, different rock types in a given climate will produce a similar soil . Even the same rock type in different climates will not produce the same type of soil. This is true because most rocks on Earth are made of the same eight elements and when the rock breaks down to become soil, those elements dominate. The same factors that lead to increased weathering also lead to greater soil formation. More rain equals more chemical reactions to weather minerals and rocks. Those reactions are most efficient in the top layers of the soil, where the water is fresh and has not yet reacted with other materials. Increased rainfall increases the amount of rock that is dissolved as well as the amount of material that is carried away by moving water. As materials are carried away, new surfaces are exposed, which also increases the rate of weathering. Climate is the most important factor in determining the type of soil that will form in a particular area. Increased temperature increases the rate of chemical reactions, which also increases soil formation. In warmer regions, plants and bacteria grow faster, which helps to weather material and produce soils. In tropical regions, where temperature and precipitation are consistently high, thick soils form. Arid regions have thin soils. Soil type also influences the type of vegetation that can grow in the region. We can identify climate types by the types of plants that grow there. ", "The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. The minerals that are present in the rock determine the composition of the material that is available to make soil. Soils may form in place or from material that has been moved. Residual soils form in place. The underlying rock breaks down to form the layers of soil that reside above it. Only about one-third of the soils in the United States are residual. Transported soils have been transported in from somewhere else. Sediments can be transported into an area by glaciers, wind, water, or gravity. Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported to a new location and deposited. ", "The steeper the slope, the less likely material will be able to stay in place to form soil. Material on a steep slope is likely to go downhill. Materials will accumulate and soil will form where land areas are flat or gently undulating. ", "Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. ", "The partial decay of plant material and animal remains produces the organic material and nutrients in soil. In soil, decomposing organisms breakdown the complex organic molecules of plant matter and animal remains to form simpler inorganic molecules that are soluble in water. Decomposing organisms also create organic acids that increase the rate of weathering and soil formation. Bacteria in the soil change atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates. The decayed remains of plant and animal life are called humus, which is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that then hold the soil together, creating its structure. Humus increases the soils porosity and water-holding capacity and helps to buffer rapid changes in soil acidity. Humus also helps the soil to hold its nutrients, increasing its fertility. Fertile soils are rich in nitrogen, contain a high percentage of organic materials, and are usually black or dark brown in color.

Each successive, lower layer is altered just a little bit less. This is because the first place where water and air come in contact with the soil is at the top.

High temperature particles vibrate faster than low temperature particles. Rapidly vibrating atoms smash together, which generates heat. As a material cools down, the atoms vibrate more slowly and collide less frequently. As a result, they emit less heat. What is the difference between heat and temperature? Temperature measures how fast a materials atoms are vibrating. Heat measures the materials total energy. ", "Heat energy is transferred between physical entities. Heat is taken in or released when an object changes state, or changes from a gas to a liquid, or a liquid to a solid. This heat is called latent heat. When a substance changes state, latent heat is released or absorbed. A substance that is changing its state of matter does not change temperature. All of the energy that is released or absorbed goes toward changing the materials state. For example, imagine a pot of boiling water on a stove burner: that water is at 100o C (212o F). If you increase the temperature of the burner, more heat enters the water. The water remains at its boiling temperature, but the additional energy goes into changing the water from liquid to gas. With more heat the water evaporates more rapidly. When water changes from a liquid to a gas it takes in heat. Since evaporation takes in heat, this is called evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling is an inexpensive way to cool homes in hot, dry areas. Substances also differ in their specific heat, the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of the material by 1.0o C (1.8o F). Water has a very high specific heat, which means it takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of water. Lets compare a puddle and asphalt, for example. If you are walking barefoot on a sunny day, which would you rather walk across, the shallow puddle or an asphalt parking lot? Because of its high specific heat, the water stays cooler than the asphalt, even though it receives the same amount of solar radiation.

These forests produce soils called pedalfers, which are common in many areas of the temperate, eastern part of the United States . The word pedalfer comes from some of the elements that are commonly found in the soil. The \"Al\" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol of the element aluminum, and the \"Fe\" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol for iron. Pedalfers are usually a very fertile, dark brown or black soil. Not surprisingly, they are rich in aluminum clays and iron oxides. Because a great deal of rainfall is common in this climate, most of the soluble minerals dissolve and are carried away, leaving the less soluble clays and iron oxides behind. A pedalfer is the dark, fertile type of soil that will form in a forested region. ", "Pedocal soils form in drier, temperate areas where grasslands and brush are the usual types of vegetation (Figure chemical weathering and less water to dissolve away soluble minerals, so more soluble minerals are present and fewer clay minerals are produced. It is a drier region with less vegetation, so the soils have lower amounts of organic material and are less fertile. A pedocal is named for the calcite enriched layer that forms. Water begins to move down through the soil layers, but before it gets very far, it begins to evaporate. Soluble minerals, like calcium carbonate, concentrate in a layer that marks the lowest place that water was able to reach. This layer is called caliche. A lizard on soil typical of an arid region in Mexico. ", "In tropical rainforests where it rains literally every day, laterite soils form . In these hot, wet, tropical regions, intense chemical weathering strips the soils of their nutrients. There is practically no humus. All soluble minerals are removed from the soil and all plant nutrients are carried away. All that is left behind are the least soluble materials, like aluminum and iron oxides. These soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. Laterite soils bake as hard as a brick if they are exposed to the Sun. A laterite is the type of thick, nutrient-poor soil that forms in the rainforest. Many climate types have not been mentioned here. Each produces a distinctive soil type that forms in the particular circumstances found there. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner but soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick but nutrient-poor. Soil development takes a very long time, it may take hundreds or even thousands of years for a good fertile topsoil to form. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil-forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, soil formation may take thousands of years!

These volcanoes rise at a hotspot above a mantle plume. Melting at a hotspot is due to pressure release as the plume rises through the mantle. Earth is home to about 50 known hotspots. Most of these are in the oceans because they are better able to penetrate oceanic lithosphere to create volcanoes. But there are some large ones in the continents. Yellowstone is a good example of a mantle plume erupting within a continent. ", "The South Pacific has many hotspot volcanic chains. The hotspot is beneath the youngest volcano in the chain and older volcanoes are found to the northwest. A volcano forms above the hotspot, but as the Pacific Plate moves, that volcano moves off the hotspot. Without its source of volcanism, it no longer erupts. The crust gets cooler and the volcano erodes. The result is a chain of volcanoes and seamounts trending northwest from the hotspot. Prominent hotspots of the world. (a) The Society Islands formed above a hotspot that is now beneath Mehetia and two submarine volcanoes. (b) The satellite image shows how the islands become smaller and coral reefs became more developed as the volcanoes move off the hotspot and grow older. The most famous example of a hotspot in the oceans is the Hawaiian Islands. Forming above the hotspot are massive shield volcanoes that together create the islands.

The subducting plate heats up as it sinks into the mantle. Also, water is mixed in with the sediments lying on top of the subducting plate. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material and lowers its melting point. Melting in the mantle above the subducting plate leads to volcanoes within an island or continental arc.

The volcanoes are located just above where the subducting plate is at the right depth in the mantle for there to be melting . The Cascades have been active for 27 million years, although the current peaks are no more than 2 million years old. The volcanoes are far enough north and are in a region where storms are common, so many are covered by glaciers. ", "At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart. As the hot mantle rock convects upward it rises higher in the mantle. The rock is under lower pressure; this lowers the melting temperature of the rock and so it melts. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures.

It is the bodys largest organ and the most important defense against disease. It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside environment. The outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis, consists of dead cells filled with the protein keratin. These cells form a tough, waterproof covering on the body. It is very difficult for pathogens to get through the epidermis. The inside of the mouth and nose are lined with mucous membranes. Other organs that are exposed to substances from the environment are also lined with mucous membranes. These include the respiratory and digestive organs. Mucous membranes arent tough like skin, but they have other ways of keeping out pathogens. One way mucous membranes protect the body is by producing mucus. Mucus is a sticky, moist secretion that covers mucous membranes. The mucus traps pathogens and particles so they cant enter the body. Many mucous membranes are also covered with cilia. These are tiny, hair-like projections. Cilia move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. You can see this in the diagram in Figure 21.10. When you clear your throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body. ", "In addition to mucus, your body releases a variety of fluids, including tears, saliva, and sweat.

", "If bacteria enter the skin through a splinter or other wound, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. It occurs due to chemicals that are released when tissue is damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood flow to the area. The chemicals also attract white blood cells to the area. The white blood cells leak out of the blood vessels and into the damaged tissue.

Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce quickly at this temperature. When the temperature rises higher, the pathogens cant reproduce as quickly. Therefore, a fever helps to limit the infection.

As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance. A carrier protein is always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration. These proteins are often called \"pumps\" because they use energy to pump the molecules across the membrane. There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active transport. The sodium-potassium pump  is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na+ ) ions and two potassium (K+ ) ions to where they are already highly concentrated. Sodium ions move out of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell. How do these ions then return to their original positions? As the ions now can flow down their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion returns the ions to their original positions either inside or outside the cell.

They must reproduce if their species is to survive. But what does it mean to reproduce? Reproduction is the ability to make the next generation, and it is one of the basic characteristics of life. Two methods of reproduction are: 1. Asexual reproduction, the process of forming a new individual from a single parent. 2. Sexual reproduction, the process of forming a new individual from two parents. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, but the result is always the same: a new life begins. ", "When humans reproduce, there are two parents involved. DNA must be passed from both the mother and father to the child. Humans cannot reproduce with just one parent; humans can only reproduce sexually. But having just one parent is possible in other eukaryotic organisms, including some insects, fish, and reptiles. These organisms can reproduce asexually, meaning the offspring (\"children\") have a single parent and share the exact same genetic material as the parent. This is very different from reproduction in humans. Bacteria, being a prokaryotic, single- celled organism, must reproduce asexually. The advantage of asexual reproduction is that it can be very quick and does not require the meeting of a male and female organism. The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents genes. Types of organisms that reproduce asexually include: 1. Prokaryotic organisms, like bacteria. Bacteria reproduce through binary fission, where they grow and divide in half . First, their chromosome replicates and the cell enlarges. The cell then divides into two cells as new membranes form to separate the two cells. After cell division, the two new cells each have one identical chromosome. This simple process allows bacteria to reproduce very rapidly. 2. Flatworms, an invertebrate animal species. Flatworms divide in two, then each half regenerates into a new flatworm identical to the original, a process called fragmentation. 3. Different types of insects, fish, and lizards. These organisms can reproduce asexually through a process called parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis happens when an unfertilized egg cell grows into a new organism. The resulting organism has half the amount of genetic material of the parent. Parthenogenesis is common in honeybees. In a hive, the sexually produced eggs become workers, while the asexually produced eggs become drones. ", "During sexual reproduction, two parents are involved. Most animals are dioecious, meaning there is a separate male and female sex, with the male producing sperm and the female producing eggs. When a sperm and egg meet during fertilization, a zygote, the first cell of a new organism, is formed . This process combines the genetic material from both parents. The resulting organism will be genetically unique. The zygote will divide by mitosis and grow into the embryo. Lets explore how animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually: Animals often have gonads, organs that produce eggs or sperm. The male gonads are the testes, and the female gonads are the ovaries. Testes produce sperm; ovaries produce eggs. Sperm and egg, the two sex cells, are known as gametes, and can combine two different ways, both of which combine the genetic material from the two parents. Gametes have half the amount of the genetic material of a regular body cell; they are haploid cells. In humans, gametes have one set of 23 chromosomes. Gametes are produced through a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes. They are diploid cells, with two sets of 23 chromosomes (23 pairs). Bacteria reproduce by binary fission. Shown is one bacterium reproducing and becoming two bacteria. During sexual reproduction, a sperm fer- tilizes an egg. Fish and other aquatic animals release their gametes in the water, which is called external fertilization ( Figure by internal fertilization. Typically males have a penis that deposits sperm into the vagina of the female. Birds do not have penises, but they do have a chamber called the cloaca that they place close to another birds cloaca to deposit sperm. Amphibians must live close to water as they must lay their eggs in a moist or wet environment prior to external fertilization. This fish guards her eggs, which will be fertilized externally. Plants can also reproduce sexually, but their reproductive organs are different from animals gonads. Plants that have flowers have their reproductive parts in the flower. The sperm is contained in the pollen, while the egg is contained in the ovary, deep within the flower. The sperm can reach the egg two different ways: 1. In self-pollination, the egg is fertilized by the pollen of the same flower. 2. In cross-pollination, sperm from the pollen of one flower fertilizes the egg of another flower. Like other types of sexual reproduction, cross-pollination allows new combinations of traits. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is carried by the wind to another flower. It can also occur when animal pollinators, like honeybees or butterflies , carry the pollen from flower to flower. Butterflies receive nectar when they de- posit pollen into flowers, resulting in cross-pollination.

One type involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. Recall that B cells and T cells are types of white blood cells that are key in the immune response. Whereas the immune systems first and second line of defense are more generalized or non-specific, the immune response is specific. It can be described as a specific response to a specific pathogen, meaning it uses methods to target just one pathogen at a time. These methods involve B and T cells. ", "B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen, a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen . They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens. This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body. ", "There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells . When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases poisons. The poisons make tiny holes in the cell membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected or damaged body cells. But they are still necessary for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on both B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens.

Many bacteria also have additional small rings of DNA known as plasmids. See bacterial cell pictured below .

The DNA of a bacterial cell is also different from a eukaryotic cell. Bacterial DNA is contained in one circular chromosome, located in the cytoplasm. Eukaryotes have several linear chromosomes. Bacteria also have two additional unique features: a cell wall and flagella. Some bacteria also have a capsule outside the cell wall. ", "Bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall consisting of peptidoglycan. This complex molecule consists of sugars and amino acids. The cell wall is important for protecting bacteria. The cell wall is so important that some antibiotics, such as penicillin, kill bacteria by preventing the cell wall from forming. Some bacteria depend on a host organism for energy and nutrients. These bacteria are known as parasites. If the host starts attacking the parasitic bacteria, the bacteria release a layer of slime that surrounds the cell wall. This slime offers an extra layer of protection. ", "Some bacteria also have tail-like structures called flagella . Flagella help bacteria move.

You may use light microscopes in the classroom. You can use a light microscope to see cells . But many structures in the cell are too small to see with a light microscope. So, what do you do if you want to see the tiny structures inside of cells? In the 1950s, scientists developed more powerful microscopes. A light microscope sends a beam of light through a specimen, or the object you are studying. A more powerful microscope, called an electron microscope, passes a beam of electrons through the specimen. Sending electrons through a cell allows us to see its smallest parts, even the parts inside the cell . Without electron microscopes, we would not know what the inside of a cell looked like. The outline of onion cells are visible under a light microscope. ", "In 1858, after using microscopes much better than Hookes first microscope, Rudolf Virchow developed the hypoth- esis that cells only come from other cells. For example, bacteria, which are single-celled organisms, divide in half (after they grow some) to make new bacteria. In the same way, your body makes new cells by dividing the cells you already have. In all cases, cells only come from cells that have existed before. This idea led to the development of one of the most important theories in biology, the cell theory. Cell theory states that: 1. All organisms are composed of cells. 2. Cells are alive and the basic living units of organization in all organisms. 3. All cells come from other cells. As with other scientific theories, many hundreds, if not thousands, of experiments support the cell theory. Since Virchow created the theory, no evidence has ever been identified to contradict it. ", "Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also can be very different . Each cell in your body is designed for a specific task. In other words, the cells function is partly based on the cells structure. For example: Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and brings it to other body cells. Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of communication with other nerve cells, like a wire. Because of this shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of touching a hot stove, to your brain. Skin cells are flat and fit tightly together to protect your body. As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs. Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have many types of specialized cells in their bodies. Red blood cells (left) are specialized to carry oxygen in the blood. Neurons (cen- ter ) are shaped to conduct electrical im- pulses to many other nerve cells. These epidermal cells (right) make up the skin of plants. Note how the cells fit tightly together. ", "While cells are the basic units of an organism, groups of cells can perform a job together. These cells are called specialized because they have a special job. Specialized cells can be organized into tissues. For example, your liver cells are organized into liver tissue. Your liver tissue is further organized into an organ, your liver. Organs are formed from two or more specialized tissues working together to perform a job. All organs, from your heart to your liver, are made up of an organized group of tissues. These organs are part of a larger system, the organ systems. For example, your brain works together with your spinal cord and other nerves to form the nervous system. This organ system must be organized with other organ systems, such as the circulatory system and the digestive system, for your body to work. Organ systems work together to form the entire organism. There are many levels of organization in living things . Levels of organization, from the atom (smallest) to the organism (largest).

The cell cycle  is the life cycle of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases. The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete). The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase is the stage when the cell mostly performs its everyday functions. For example, it is when a kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis. Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions. Interphase can be divided into three stages: 1. The first growth phase (G1): During the G1 stage, the cell doubles in size and doubles the number of organelles. 2. The synthesis phase (S): The DNA is replicated during this phase. In other words, an identical copy of all the cells DNA is made. This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the parental cell. This process is called DNA replication. 3. The second growth phase (G2): Proteins are synthesized that will help the cell divide. At the end of interphase, the cell is ready to enter mitosis. Shown is the cell cycle. Notice that most of the cell cycle is spent in Inter- phase (G1, S, and G2). Mitosis and cy- tokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase. Some cells may enter a resting phase dur- ing which progression through the cycle stops. During mitosis, the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated.

And each cell in that baby will be genetically identical, meaning that each cell will have exactly the same DNA. How does a new life go from one cell to so many? The cell divides in half, creating two cells. Then those two cells divide, for a total of four cells. The new cells continue to divide and divide. One cell becomes two, then four, then eight, and so on . This continual process of a cell dividing and creating two new cells is known as cell division. Cell division is part of a cycle of cellular growth and division known as the cell cyclecells must grow before they divide. The cell cycle describes the \"life\" of a eukayrotic cell. In addition to cell division, the cell cycle includes the division of the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Most cell division produces genetically identical cells, meaning they have the same DNA. The process of mitosis, which specifically is the division of the nucleus, ensures that each cell has the same DNA. During mitosis, the chromosomes equally separate, thus making sure each nucleus in each resulting cell after cell division is genetically identical. A special form of cell division, called meiosis, produces cells with half as much DNA as the parent cell. These cells are used for reproduction. In prokaryotic organisms, cell division is how those organisms reproduce. Besides the development of a baby, there are many other reasons that cell division is necessary for life: Cells divide repeatedly to produce an em- bryo. Previously the one-celled zygote (the first cell of a new organism) divided to make two cells (a). Each of the two cells divides to yield four cells (b), then the four cells divide to make eight cells (c), and so on. Through cell division, an entire embryo forms from one initial cell. 1. To grow and develop, you must form new cells. Imagine how often your cells must divide during a growth spurt. Growing just an inch requires countless cell divisions. Your body must produce new bone cells, new skin cells, new cells in your blood vessels and so on. 2. Cell division is also necessary to repair damaged cells. Imagine you cut your finger. After the scab forms, it will eventually disappear and new skin cells will grow to repair the wound. Where do these cells come from? Some of your existing skin cells divide and produce new cells. 3. Your cells can also simply wear out. Over time you must replace old and worn-out cells. Cell division is essential to this process.

The phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a hydrophilic (\"water-loving\") head and two hydrophobic (\"water-hating\") tails. Because of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in a specific pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically be in contact with water. Remember that there is water outside the cell, and the cytoplasm inside the cell is mostly water as well. So the phospholipids are arranged in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the cell separate from its environment. Lipids do not mix with water (recall that oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and keeping the cytoplasm inside the cell. The cell membrane allows the cell to stay structurally intact in its water-based environment. The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell.

A polar head that is hydrophilic, or water-loving. 2. A fatty acid tail that is hydrophobic, or water-fearing. The cell membrane is made up of a phos- pholipid bilayer, two layers of phospho- lipid molecules. Notice the polar head group of the phospholipid is attached to the phosphate, and the tails are two fatty acid chains. The head group and tails are attached by a glycerol backbone. There is water found on both the inside and the outside of cells. Since hydrophilic means water-loving, and they want to be near water, the heads face the inside and outside of the cell where water is found. The water-fearing, hydrophobic tails face each other in the middle of the cell membrane, because water is not found in this space. The phospholipid bilayer allows the cell to stay intact in a water-based environment. An interesting quality of the plasma membrane is that it is very \"fluid\" and constantly moving, like a soap bubble. This fluid nature of the membrane is important in maintaining homeostasis. It allows the proteins in the membrane to float to areas where they are needed. Due to the composition of the cell membrane, small molecules such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass freely through the membrane, but other molecules, especially large molecules, cannot easily pass through the plasma membrane.

It might seem hard to think of similarities among such different organisms, but they actually have many properties in common. Living organisms are similar to each other because all organisms evolved from the same common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. All living organisms: 1. Need energy to carry out life processes. 2. Are composed of one or more cells. 3. Respond to their environment. 4. Grow and reproduce. 5. Maintain a stable internal environment. ", "Why do you eat everyday? To get energy. Energy is the ability to do work. Without energy, you could not do any \"work.\" Though not doing any \"work\" may sound nice, the \"work\" fueled by energy includes everyday activities, such as walking, writing, and thinking. But you are not the only one who needs energy. In order to grow and reproduce and carry out the other process of life, all living organisms need energy. But where does this energy come from? The source of energy differs for each type of living thing. In your body, the source of energy is the food you eat. Here is how animals, plants, and fungi obtain their energy: All animals must eat in order to obtain energy. Animals also eat to obtain building materials. Animals eat plants and other animals. Plants dont eat. Instead, they use energy from the sun to make their \"food\" through the process of photosyn- thesis. Mushrooms and other fungi obtain energy from other organisms. Thats why you often see fungi growing on a fallen tree; the rotting tree is their source of energy . Since plants harvest energy from the sun and other organisms get their energy from plants, nearly all the energy of living things initially comes from the sun. Orange bracket fungi on a rotting log in the Oak Openings Preserve in Ohio. Fungi obtain energy from breaking down dead organisms, such as this rotting log. ", "If you zoom in very close on a leaf of a plant, or on the skin on your hand, or a drop of blood, you will find cells, you will find cells . Cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Most cells are so small that they are usually visible only through a microscope. Some organisms, like bacteria, plankton that live in the ocean, or the Paramecium, shown in Figure 1.3, are unicellular, made of just one cell. Other organisms have millions, billions, or trillions of cells. All cells have at least some structures in common, such as ribosomes, which are the sites where proteins are made. All cells also have DNA and proteins. The nucleus is clearly visible in the blood cells . The nucleus can be described as the \"information center,\" containing the instructions (DNA) for making all the proteins in a cell, as well as how much of each protein to make. The nucleus is also the main distinguishing feature between the two general categories of cell, with cells known as prokaryotic lacking a nucleus. Although the cells of different organisms are built differently, they all have certain general functions. Every cell must get energy from food, be able to grow and divide, and respond to its environment. More about cell structure and function will be discussed in additional concepts. ", "All living organisms are able to react to something important or interesting in their external environment. For example, living organisms constantly respond to their environment. They respond to changes in light, heat, sound, and chemical and mechanical contact. Organisms have means for receiving information, such as eyes, ears, taste buds, or other structures. ", "All living things reproduce to make the next generation. Organisms that do not reproduce will go extinct. As a result, there are no species that do not reproduce . Some organisms reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction), especially single-celled organisms, and make identical copies (or clones) of themselves. Other organisms reproduce sexually ( sexual reproduction), combining genetic information from two parents to make genetically unique offspring. ", "When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to warm up your body. When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat. When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis. Like us, many animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature. A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm . A bird fluffs its feathers to stay warm and to maintain homeostasis.

In 1997, that all changed when a sheep named Dolly was the first large mammal ever to be successfully cloned. Other animals can now also be cloned in a laboratory. The process of producing an animal like Dolly starts with a single cell from the animal that is going to be cloned. Below are the steps involved in the process of cloning: 1. In the case of Dolly, cells from the mammary glands were taken from the adult that was to be cloned. But other somatic cells can be used. Somatic cells come from the body and are not gametes like sperm or egg. 2. The nucleus is removed from this cell. 3. The nucleus is placed in a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed. The nucleus must be removed from the donor egg to maintain the appropriate chromosome number. 4. The new cell is stimulated with an electric shock and embryo development begins, as if it were a normal zygote. The zygote is the first cell of a new organism. 5. The resulting embryo is implanted into a mother sheep, where it continue its development .

In order to produce a cloned human, many attempts would result in the surrogate mothers experiencing miscarriages, stillbirths, or deformities in the infant.

", "Red blood cells (RBCs) are flattened, disk-shaped cells that carry oxygen. They are the most common blood cell in the blood. There are about 4 to 6 million RBCs per cubic millimeter of blood. Each RBC has about 200 million molecules of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin also gives the red blood cells their red color. Red blood cells  are made in the red marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and vertebrae. Each red blood cell lives for only 120 days (about four months). After this time, they are destroyed in the liver and spleen. Mature red blood cells do not have a nucleus or other organelles. Lacking these components allows the cells to have more hemoglobin and carry more oxygen. The flattened shape of red blood cells helps them carry more oxygen than if they were rounded. ", "White blood cells (WBCs) are usually larger than red blood cells. They do not have hemoglobin and do not carry oxygen. White blood cells make up less than one percent of the bloods volume. Most WBCs are made in the bone marrow, and some mature in the lymphatic system. There are different WBCs with different jobs. WBCs defend the body against infection by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. WBCs do have a nucleus and other organelles. Neutrophils are WBCs that can squeeze through capillary walls and swallow particles such as bacteria and parasites. Macrophages are large WBCs that can also swallow and destroy old and dying cells, bacteria, or viruses. Below, a macrophage is attacking and swallowing two particles, possibly disease-causing pathogens ( Figure Lymphocytes are WBCs that fight infections caused by viruses and bacteria. Some lymphocytes attack and kill cancer cells. Lymphocytes called B-cells make antibodies. A type of white blood cell, called a macrophage, is attacking a cancer cell.

This clot stops more blood from leaving the body through the cut blood vessel. The clot also stops bacteria from entering the body.

Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the substance to an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount) of the substance .

During diffusion, molecules are said to flow down their concentration gradient, flowing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Molecules flowing down a concentration gradient is a natural process and does not require energy. Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, as long as a concentration gradient exists. Molecules will continue to flow in this manner until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, there is no longer an area of high concentration or low concentration, and molecules flow equally in both directions across the semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are entering and leaving a cell. Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of a higher amount toward an area of lower amount. A concentra- tion gradient initially exists across the cell membrane. Equilibrium is reached when there is an equal amount of the substance on both sides of the membrane.

A hypotonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has a lower concentration of dissolved material than the inside of the cell. If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water will move into the cell. This causes the cell to swell, and it may even burst. 2. A hypertonic solution means the environment outside of the cell has more dissolved material than inside of the cell. If a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, water will leave the cell. This can cause a cell to shrink and shrivel. 3. An isotonic solution is a solution in which the amount of dissolved material is equal both inside and outside of the cell. Water still flows in both directions, but an equal amount enters and leaves the cell. ", "How do marine animals keep their cells from shrinking? How do you keep your blood cells from bursting? Both of these questions have to do with the cell membrane and osmosis. Marine animals live in salt water, which is a hypertonic environment; there is more salt in the water than in their cells. To prevent losing too much water from their bodies, these animals intake large quantities of salt water and then secrete the excess salt. Red blood cells can be kept from bursting or shriveling if put in a solution that is isotonic to the blood cells. If the blood cells were put in pure water, the solution would be hypotonic to the blood cells, so water would enter the blood cells, and they would swell and burst . Osmosis causes these red blood cells to change shape by losing or gaining water.

DNA replication occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division. The base pairing rules are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when DNA is copied to form an identical molecule of DNA. The general steps involved in DNA replication are as follows: 1. The DNA helix unwinds like a zipper as the bonds between the base pairs are broken. The enzyme DNA Helicase is involved in breaking these bonds. 2. The two single strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a new stand to be created. Using DNA as a template means that on the new strand, the bases are placed in the correct order because of the base pairing rules. Recall that A and T are complementary bases, as are G and C. As a template strand is read, the new strand is created. If ATGCCA is on the \"template strand,\" then TACGGT will be on the new DNA strand. The enzyme DNA Polymerase reads the template and builds the new strand of DNA. 3. The new set of nucleotides then join together to form a new strand of DNA. The process results in two DNA molecules, each with one old strand and one new strand of DNA. This process is known as semiconservative replication because one strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new DNA molecule .

They swim through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization normally takes place. A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below . If the sperm breaks through the eggs membrane, it will immediately cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out. This ensures that only a single sperm can penetrate an egg. It will also cause the egg to go through meiosis. Recall that meiosis, cell division that creates the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary. In fact, it begins prior to birth. The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other cells in the body. These cells are haploid, with a single set of chromosomes. This is because when they combine together, they form a cell with the full number of chromosomes. The cell they form is called a zygote.

", "Slime molds usually measure about one or two centimeters, but a few slime molds are as big as several meters. They often have bright colors, such as a vibrant yellow . Others are brown or white. Stemonitis is a kind of slime mold which forms small brown bunches on the outside of rotting logs. Physarum polycephalum lives inside rotting logs and is a gooey mesh of yellow \"threads\" that are several centimeters long. Fuligo, sometimes called vomit mold, is a yellow slime mold found in decaying wood. An example of a slime mold. ", "Water molds mostly live in water or moist soil. They can be parasites of plants and animals, getting their nutrients from these organisms and also from decaying organisms. They are a common problem for farmers since they cause a variety of plant diseases. One of the most famous of these diseases was the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine in the 1800s. At this time, potatoes were the main source of food for many of the Irish people. The failure of the potato crop meant that many people in Ireland died of starvation or migrated to other countries.

Though gene therapy is still in experimental stages, the common use of this therapy may occur during your lifetime. There are two main types of gene therapy: 1. One done inside the body ( in vivo). 2. One done outside the body ( ex vivo). Both types of gene therapy use a vector, or carrier molecule for the gene. The vector helps incorporate the desired gene into the patients DNA. Usually this vector is modified viral DNA in which the viral genes have been removed.

", "During in vivo gene therapy, done inside the body, the vector with the gene of interest is introduced directly into the patient and taken up by the patients cells . For example, cystic fibrosis gene therapy is targeted at the respiratory system, so a solution with the vector can be sprayed into the patients nose. Recently, in vivo gene therapy was also used to partially restore the vision of three young adults with a rare type of eye disease. In ex vivo gene therapy, done outside the body, cells are removed from the patient and the proper gene is inserted using a virus as a vector. The modified cells are placed back into the patient. One of the first uses of this type of gene therapy was in the treatment of a young girl with a rare genetic disease, adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA deficiency. People with this disorder are missing the ADA enzyme, which breaks down a toxin called deoxyadenosine. If the toxin is not broken down, it accumulates and destroys immune cells. As a result, individuals with ADA deficiency do not have a healthy immune system to fight off infections. In the gene therapy treatment for this disorder, bone marrow stem cells were taken from the girls body, and the missing gene was inserted into these cells outside the body. Then the modified cells were put back into her bloodstream. This treatment successfully restored the function of her immune system, but only with repeated treatments.

In fact, they are the biggest cells in the human female body. (How many egg cells are in the human male body?) An egg is about 30 times as wide as a sperm cell! You can even see an egg cell without a microscope. Like a sperm cell, the egg contains a nucleus with half the number of chromosomes as other body cells. Unlike a sperm cell, the egg contains a lot of cytoplasm, the contents of the cell, which is why it is so big. The egg also does not have a tail. ", "Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It takes several steps to make an egg: 1. Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis (cell division), producing identical cells. 2. The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis. But they only go through the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at that time. They go through the second stage of cell division after the female goes through puberty. 3. In a mature female, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month. The drawing below shows how this happens . As you can see from the figure, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes. The follicle protects the egg as it matures in the ovary. After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary. This is called ovulation, which usually occurs at the midpoint of a monthly cycle. In a 28 day cycle, ovulation would occur around day 14. The moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube then sweep the egg into the tube. At this time, if sperm are present the egg can be fertilized. Fertilization occurs if a sperm enters the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. When this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that are different in size. The smaller cell is called a polar body. It contains very little cytoplasm. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the egg. It contains most of the cytoplasm. This will develop into a child.

What is the role of each part? How do you think the shape of the sperm might help it swim? ", "To make sperm, cells start in the testes and end in the epididymis. It takes up to two months to make sperm. The steps are explained below: 1. Special cells in the testes go through mitosis (cell division) to make identical copies of themselves. 2. The copies of the original cells divide by meiosis, producing cells called spermatids. The spermatids have half the number of chromosomes as the original cell. The spermatids are immature and cannot move on their own. 3. The spermatids are transported from the testes to the epididymis. Involuntary muscular contraction moves the spermatids along. 4. In the epididymis, spermatids slowly grow older and mature. They grow a tail. They also lose some of the cytoplasm from the head. It is here that the spermatids mature, becoming sperm cells. 5. When sperm are mature, they can swim. The mature sperm are stored in the epididymis until it is time for them to leave the body. Sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens. As they travel through the vas deferens, they pass by the prostate and other glands. The sperm mix with liquids from these glands, forming semen. The semen travels through the urethra and leaves the body through the penis. A teaspoon of semen may contain as many as 500 million sperm!

They are necessary when the body is fighting off an infection. But what happens to them after the pathogen has been destroyed? Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells. They allow the immune system to remember the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight the pathogen or disease. These dividing cells will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to attack the pathogen in this way is called immunity. Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to develop immunity. In vaccination, a modified pathogen is usually injected under the skin by a shot. Only part of the pathogen is injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but the shot prepares your body for fighting the pathogen without causing the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune response against the injected antigen. The body prepares \"memory\" cells for use at a later time, in case the antigen is ever encountered again. Essentially, a vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without making a person sick. In many countries, children receive their first vaccination at birth with the Hepatitis B shot, which protects infants from Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are now protected by vaccines, we do not see these diseases nearly as often. Diseases you have probably been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. How does a vaccine work? See How a Vaccine Works at  and The History of Vaccines at  .

", "The bodys second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. This little girl just got her first scraped knee. It doesnt seem to hurt, but the break in her skin could let pathogens enter her body. Thats why scrapes should be kept clean and protected until they heal. ", "What do these white blood cells do at the site of inflammation? The main role of white blood cells is to fight pathogens in the body. There are actually several different kinds of white blood cells. Some white blood cells have very specific functions. They attack only certain pathogens. Other white blood cells attack any pathogen they find. These white blood cells travel to areas of the body that are inflamed. They are called phagocytes, which means eating cells. Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte. In addition to pathogens, phagocytes eat dead cells. They surround the pathogens and destroy them. Sometimes it is said that the phagocyte engulfs the pathogen, and then destroys it. This process is called phagocytosis. White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection.

", "Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the cardiovascular system, which you can read about in a previous concept. Lymph vessels are like blood vessels, except they move lymph instead of blood. Lymph is a yellowish liquid that leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. Where there is more inflammation, there is usually more lymph in tissues. This lymph may contain many pathogens. The lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. It then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Lymph is not pumped through lymph vessels like blood is pumped through blood vessels by the heart. Instead, muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along. The lymph finally reaches the main lymph vessels in the chest. Here, the lymph drains into two large veins. This is how the lymph returns to the bloodstream. Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, pathogens are removed from it at lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small, oval structures located along the lymph vessels. They act like filters. Any pathogens filtered out of the lymph at lymph nodes are destroyed by lymphocytes in the nodes. ", "Lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell, are the key cells of an immune response. There are trillions of lymphocytes in the human body. They make up about one quarter of all white blood cells. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The rest are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes: 1. B cells. This image of a lymphocyte was made with an electron microscope. The lym- phocyte is shown 10,000 times its actual size. 2. T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in the red bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow larger. The \"B\" in B cells stands for bone. B cells grow larger in red bone marrow. The \"T\" in T cells stands for thymus. T cells mature in the thymus gland. B and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have proteins, often located on their cell surface. These proteins are called antigens. An antigen is any protein that causes an immune response, because it is unlike any protein that the body makes. Antigens are found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Your body sees these as foreign, meaning they do not belong in your body.

During mitosis, the copied DNA is divided into two complete sets, so that after cytokinesis, each cell has a complete set of genetic instructions. ", "To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes. Each organism has a unique number of chromosomes. In human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical sister chromatids, forming an \"X\" shaped molecule . The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the centromere. The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during mitosis. The spindles separate sister chromatids from each other. ", "During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of \"1/2 of the X.\" Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase . 1. Prophase: The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming chromosomes. The DNA becomes so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope. The membrane around the nucleus, called the nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move. 2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up in the center, or the equator, of the cell. The chromosomes line up in a row, one on top of the next. 3. Anaphase: The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate as the spindles pull the chromatids apart, resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes. 4. Telophase: The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in both cells. An overview of the cell cycle and mito- sis: during prophase the chromosomes condense, during metaphase the chromo- somes line up, during anaphase the sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell, and during telophase the nuclear envelope forms.

When you flip the switch, the electricity flows to the light through wires inside the walls. The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the light, but the light still comes on as soon as you flip the switch. Nerve impulses travel just as fast through the network of nerves inside the body. The axons of many neurons, like the one shown here, are covered with a fatty layer called myelin sheath.

Sensory neurons carry nerve impulses from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. Motor neurons carry nerve impulses from the central nervous system to organs, glands, and musclesthe opposite direction. Both types of neurons work together. Sensory neurons carry information about the environment found inside or outside of the body to the central nervous system. The central nervous system uses the information to send messages through motor neurons to tell the body how to respond to the information. ", "The place where the axon of one neuron meets the dendrite of another is called a synapse. Synapses are also found between neurons and other types of cells, such as muscle cells. The axon of the sending neuron does not actually touch the dendrite of the receiving neuron. There is a tiny gap between them, the synaptic cleft . The following steps describe what happens when a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon. 1. 2. 3. 4. When a nerve impulse reaches the end of an axon, the axon releases chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters travel across the synapse between the axon and the dendrite of the next neuron. Neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite. The binding allows the nerve impulse to travel through the receiving neuron. Did you ever watch a relay race? After the first runner races, he or she passes the baton to the next runner, who takes over. Neurons are a little like relay runners. Instead of a baton, they pass neurotransmitters to the next neuron. Examples of neurotransmitters are chemicals such as serotonin, dopamine, and adrenaline. You can watch an animation of nerve impulses and neurotransmitters at  Some people have low levels of the neurotransmitter called serotonin in their brain.

Each also had one allele that was always dominant over the recessive allele. But this is not always true. There are exceptions to Mendels rules, and these exceptions usually have something to do with the dominant allele. If you cross a homozygous red flower with a homozygous white flower, according to Mendels laws, what color flower should result from the cross? Either a completely red or completely white flower, depending on which allele is dominant. But since Mendels time, scientists have discovered this is not always the case. ", "One allele is NOT always completely dominant over another allele. Sometimes an individual has a phenotype between the two parents because one allele is not dominant over another. This pattern of inheritance is called incomplete dominance. For example, snapdragon flowers show incomplete dominance. One of the genes for flower color in snapdragons has two alleles, one for red flowers and one for white flowers. A plant that is homozygous for the red allele (RR) will have red flowers, while a plant that is homozygous for the white allele will have white flowers (WW). But the heterozygote will have pink flowers (RW)  as both alleles are expressed. Neither the red nor the white allele is dominant, so the phenotype of the offspring is a blend of the two parents. Pink snapdragons are an example of in- complete dominance. Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant (SS) will have normal red blood cells. What type of blood cells do you think a person who is heterozygous (Ss) for the trait will have? They will have some misshapen cells and some normal cells . Both the dominant and recessive alleles are expressed, so the result is a phenotype that is a combination of the recessive and dominant traits. Sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become misshapen and curved unlike normal, rounded red blood cells. ", "Another exception to Mendels laws is a phenomenon called codominance. For example, our blood type shows codominance. Do you know what your blood type is? Are you A? O? AB? Those letters actually represent alleles. Unlike other traits, your blood type has three alleles, instead of two! The ABO blood types  are named for the protein attached to the outside of the blood cell. In this case, two alleles are dominant and completely expressed (IA and IB ), while one allele is recessive (i). The IA allele encodes for red blood cells with the A antigen, while the IB allele encodes for red blood cells with the B antigen. The recessive allele (i) does not encode for any proteins. Therefore a person with two recessive alleles (ii) has type O blood. As no dominant (IA and IB ) allele is present, the person cannot have type A or type B blood. What are the genotypes of a person with type A or type B blood? An example of codominant inheritance is ABO blood types. There are two possible genotypes for type A blood, homozygous (IA IA ) and heterozygous (IA i), and two possible genotypes for type B blood, (IB IB and IB i). If a person is heterozygous for both the IA and IB alleles, they will express both and have type AB blood with both proteins on each red blood cell. This pattern of inheritance is significantly different than Mendels rules for inheritance, because both alleles are expressed completely, and one does not mask the other.

A factory has many machines and people, and each has a specific role. Just like a factory, the cell is made up of many different parts. Each part has a special role. The different parts of the cell are called organelles, which means \"small organs.\" All organelles are found in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are \"simpler\" than eukaryotic cells. Though prokaryotic cells still have many functions, they are not as specialized as eukaryotic cells, lacking membrane-bound organelles. Thus, most organelles are not found in prokaryotic cells. Below are the main organelles found in eukaryotic cells : 1. The nucleus of a cell is like a safe containing the factorys trade secrets. The nucleus contains the genetic material (DNA), the information needed to build thousands of proteins. 2. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria are the organelles where cellular energy is produced, providing the energy needed to power chemical reactions. This process, known as cellular respiration, produces energy is in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Cells that use a lot of energy may have thousands of mitochondria. 3. Vesicles are small membrane bound sacs that transport materials around the cell and to the cell membrane. 4. The vacuoles are like storage centers. Plant cells have larger vacuoles than animal cells. Plants store water and nutrients in their large central vacuoles. 5. Lysosomes are like the recycling trucks that carry waste away from the factory. Lysosomes have digestive enzymes that break down old molecules into parts that can be recycled. 6. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made. Ribosomes are like the machines in the factory that produce the factorys main product. Proteins are the main product of the cell. 7. Some ribosomes can be found on folded membranes called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), others float freely in the cytoplasm. If the ER is covered with ribosomes, it looks bumpy like sandpaper, and is called the rough endoplasmic reticulum. If the ER does not contain ribosomes, it is smooth and called the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Many proteins are made on the ribosomes on the rough ER. These proteins immedi- ately enter the ER, where they are modified, packaged into vesicles and sent to the Golgi apparatus. Lipids are made in the smooth ER. 8. The Golgi apparatus works like a mail room. The Golgi apparatus receives proteins from the rough ER and puts \"shipping addresses\" on them. The Golgi then packages the proteins into vesicles and sends them to the right place in the cell or to the cell membrane. Some of these proteins are secreted from the cell (they exit the cell); others are placed into the cell membrane. Also, the cytoskeleton gives the cell its shape, and the flagella helps the cell to move. Prokaryotic cells may also have flagella.

It does not allow everything to pass through. Some molecules can pass easily through your cell membranes, while others have more difficulty. Sometimes molecules need the help of special transport proteins to move across the cell membrane. Some molecules even need an input of energy to help get them across the cell membrane. The movement of molecules across a membrane without the input of energy is known as passive transport. When energy (ATP) is needed, the movement is known as active transport. Active transport moves molecules against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. ", "One example of passive transport is diffusion, when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally flow down their concentration gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy. In simple diffusion, molecules that are small and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply flow through the cell membrane. Simple diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein. Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood. Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream. Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs. ", "Sometimes, molecules cannot move through the cell membrane on their own. These molecules need special transport proteins to help them move across the membrane, a process known as facilitative diffusion. These special proteins are called channel proteins or carrier proteins , and they are attached to the cell membrane. In fact, they go through the cell membrane, from the inside of the cell to the outside. Channel proteins provide an open channel or passageway through the cell membrane for molecules to move across. Many channel proteins allow the diffusion of ions. Ions are charged atoms. The charge makes it difficult to cross the cell membrane without assistance. Channel proteins are specific for the molecule they transport. For example a sodium ion crosses the membrane through a channel protein specific for sodium ions. Carrier proteins bind and carry the molecules across the cell membrane. These proteins bind a molecule on one side of the membrane, change shape as they carry the molecule across the membrane, and deposit the molecule on the other side of the membrane. Even though a protein is involved in both these methods of transport, neither method requires energy. Therefore these are still types of passive transport.

Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage of having haploid cells or diploid cells. If a plant has a haploid chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome number? If the diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number? Plants alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants. This is called alternation of generations, because the plant type alternates from generation to generation. In alternation of generations, the plant alternates between a sporophyte that has diploid cells and a gametophyte that has haploid cells. Alternation of generations can be summarized in the following four steps: follow along in the Figure 1.1 as you read through the steps. 1. The haploid gametophyte produces the gametes, or sperm and egg, by mitosis. Remember, gametes are haploid, having one set of chromosomes. 2. Then, the sperm fertilizes the egg, producing a diploid zygote that develops into the sporophyte, which of course, is diploid. 3. The diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis. 4. The haploid spores go through mitosis, developing into the haploid gametophyte. As we will see in additional Plants concepts, the generation in which the plant spends most of its life cycle is different between various plants. In the plants that first evolved, the gametophyte takes up the majority of the life cycle of the plant. During the course of evolution, the sporophyte became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant. In ferns, the sporophyte is dominant and produces spores that germinate into a heart-shaped gametophyte.

Sponges must pump water through their bodies in order to eat. Because sponges are sessile, meaning they cannot move, they filter water to obtain their food. They are, therefore, known as filter feeders. Filter feeders must filter the water to separate out the organisms and nutrients they want to eat from those they do not. You might think that sponges dont look like animals at all. They dont have a head or legs. Internally, they do not have brains, stomachs, or other organs. This is because sponges evolved much earlier than other animals. In fact, sponges do not even have true tissues. Instead, their bodies are made up of specialized cells (cell-level organization) that do specific jobs. Other animals, including humans, have tissue-level organization because they have tissues with specific functions. Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more independent of each other than are the cells of other animals. For example, some cells control the flow of water, in and out of the sponge, by increasing or decreasing the size of the pores. The sponges often have tube-like bodies with many tiny pores. There are roughly 5,000 sponge species. Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals. As sponges dont have mouths, they must feed by some other method. Sponges have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells in the sponge walls filter food from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings. The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella, which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals. Sponges reproduce by both asexual and sexual means. Sponges that reproduce asexually produce buds or, more often, structures called gemmules, which are packets of several cells of various types inside a protective covering. Freshwater sponges often produce gemmules prior to winter, which then develop into adult sponges beginning the following spring. Most sponges that reproduce sexually are hermaphroditic and produce eggs and sperm at different times. Sperm are frequently released into the water, where they are captured by sponges of the same species. The sperm are then transported to eggs, fertilization occurs and the zygotes develop into larvae. Some sponges release their larvae, where others retain them for some time. Once the larvae are in the water, they settle and develop into juvenile sponges.

Viruses also cannot reproduce on their ownthey need to infect a host cell to reproduce. So a virus is very different from any of the organisms that fall into the three domains of life. Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important traits with living organisms. They have genetic material like all cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve. The genetic material of a virus can change (mutate), altering the traits of the virus.

A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute.

Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in Figure 10.3. If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot tea than in iced tea. If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm ocean water than in cold ocean water. The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the amount of force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. Do you wonder why temperature and pressure affect solubility in these ways?

In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a voltage source, an electromagnet, and the clapper of a bell. When current flows through the circuit, the electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring. Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off. The clapper returns to its original position, which closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more. This sequence of events keeps repeating as long as the button by the front door is being pressed.

The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected to a shaft. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet turns, causing the shaft to turn as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. Why does the motors electromagnet turn? Notice that the electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to turn toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets. A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed. The reversed poles are once again repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to continue to turn.

Melted chocolate can be put in a fridge to re-harden. Dissolving salt in water is also a physical change. How do you think you could undo it? ", "Did you ever make a \"volcano,\" like the one in Figure 3.17, using baking soda and vinegar? What happens when the two substances combine? They produce an eruption of foamy bubbles. This happens because of a chemical change. A chemical change occurs when matter changes chemically into an entirely different substance with different chemical properties. When vinegar and baking soda combine, they form carbon dioxide, a gas that causes the bubbles. Its the same gas that gives soft drinks their fizz.

This is a chemical change that makes the pennies bright and shiny again. You can try this yourself at home to see how well it works. ", "If you build a campfire, like the one in Figure 3.19, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all thats left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way, but in fact, the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass. The law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through physical or chemical changes, the total mass of matter always remains the same. (In the chapter Nuclear Chemistry, you will learn about nuclear reactions, in which mass is converted into energy. But other than that, the law of conservation of mass holds.)

At high temperatures, particles of a liquid gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them, so they change to a gas. The gas forms bubbles that rise to the surface of the liquid because gas is less dense than liquid. The bubbling up of the liquid is called boiling. When the bubbles reach the surface, the gas escapes into the air. The entire process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas that escapes into the air is called vaporization.

A: Electric charges flow when they have electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. ", "Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases.

They are called electric conductors. A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire. A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter. A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current.

It absorbs electrical energy and converts some of it to light and heat. Q: The tungsten wire inside a light bulb is extremely thin. How does this help it do its job?

GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amount of current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping.

In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a source of current, an electromagnet, and a clapper that strikes a bell. What happens when current flows through the doorbell circuit? The electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring.

For example, in an electric fan, the rotating shaft turns the blades of the fan. Why does the motors electromagnet rotate? The electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to rotate toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets. A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed.

There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. An n-type (negative-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal extra electrons. You can see this in the Figure 1.1. An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal of a battery. A p-type (positive-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged holes where electrons are missing. This is also shown in the Figure 1.1. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal of a battery. ", "A diode is an electronic component that consists of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor placed side by side, as shown in the Figure 1.2. When a diode is connected by leads to a source of voltage, electrons flow from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can flow in a diode. This makes a diode useful for changing alternating current to direct current. ", "A transistor consists of three semiconductors, either p-n-p or n-p-n. Both arrangements are illustrated in the Figure (through the base). Then a much larger current can flow through the transistor from end to end (from collector to emitter). This means that a transmitter can be used as a switch, with pulses of a small current turning a larger current on and off. A transistor can also be used to increase the amount of current flowing through a circuit. ", "An integrated circuitalso called a microchipis a tiny, flat piece of silicon that consists of layers of many electronic components such as transistors. You can see an integrated circuit in the Figure 1.4. Look how small it is compared with the finger its resting on. Although the integrated circuit is tiny, it may contain millions of smaller electronic components. Current flows extremely rapidly in an integrated circuit because it doesnt have far to travel. Integrated circuits are used in virtually all modern electronic devices to carry out specific tasks.

A: Other examples include game systems and MP3 players. ", "Lets take a close look at the computer as an example of an electronic device. A computer contains integrated circuits, or microchips, that consist of millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded in digital electronic signals. Rapid pulses of voltage switch electric current on and off, producing long strings of 1s (current on) and 0s (current off). The 1s and 0s are the letters of the code, and a huge number of them are needed. One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for binary digit. Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte. Because a computers circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small. The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals are pictured and described in the Figure 1.1. They include the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. The motherboard ties all these parts of the computer together. The CPU, or central processing unit, carries out program instructions. The hard drive is a magnetic disc that provides long-term storage for programs and data. ROM (read-only memory) is a microchip that provides permanent storage. It stores important information such as start-up instructions. This memory remains even after the computer is turned off. RAM (random-access memory) is a microchip that temporarily stores programs and data that are currently being used. Anything stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off. The motherboard is connected to the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. It allows all these parts of the computer to receive power and communicate with one another. Q: Which part(s) of a computer are you using when you type a school report? A: You are using the RAM to store the word processing program and your document as you type it.

For example, if you sit in front of a fan, you feel cooler. Thats because moving air helps to evaporate the sweat on your skin. But why does the evaporation of sweat cool you down? When a liquid such as sweat evaporates, energetic particles on the surface of the liquid escape into the air. After these particles leave, the remaining liquid has less energy, so it is cooler. This is called evaporative cooling. Q: On a hot day, high humidity makes you feel even hotter. Can you explain why? A: Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. When humidity is high, sweat evaporates more slowly because there is already a lot of water vapor in the air. The slower evaporation rate reduces the potential for evaporative cooling.

However, they cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container, as particles of a gas can. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface of the liquid will be exposed to the air, like the vinegar in the bottle pictured in the Figure 1.1. Q: Why does most water on Earths surface exist in a liquid state? In what other states does water exist on Earth? A: Almost 97 percent of water on Earths surface is found as liquid salt water in the oceans. The temperature over most of Earths surface is above the freezing point (0 C) of water, so relatively little water exists as ice. Even near the poles, most of the water in the oceans is above the freezing point. And in very few places on Earths surface do temperatures reach the boiling point (100 C) of water. Although water exists in the atmosphere in a gaseous state, water vapor makes up less than 1 percent of Earths total water. ", "Two unique properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruits mass is less than 1 kg. Q: If the fruit were at a lower level than the iron object, what would be the mass of the fruit? A: The mass of the fruit would be greater than 1 kg. Mass is commonly confused with weight. The two are closely related, but they measure different things. Whereas mass measures the amount of matter in an object, weight measures the force of gravity acting on an object. The force of gravity on an object depends on its mass but also on the strength of gravity. If the strength of gravity is held constant (as it is all over Earth), then an object with a greater mass also has a greater weight. Q: With Earths gravity, an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 2.2 lb. How much does a 10 kg object weigh on Earth? A: A 10 kg object weighs ten times as much as a 1 kg object: 10  2.2 lb = 22 lb ", "Volume is a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m3 ), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm3 , and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of a liquid is measured with a measuring container, such as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder. The volume of a gas depends on the volume of its container: gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. The volume of a regularly shaped solid can be calculated from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height. The volume of an irregularly shaped solid can be measured by the displacement method.

A type of balance called a triple beam balance is pictured in Figure 1.1. To use this type of balance, follow these steps: 1. Place the object to be measured on the pan at the left side of the balance. 2. Slide the movable masses to the right until the right end of the arm is level with the balance mark. Start by moving the larger masses and then fine tune the measurement by moving the smaller masses as needed. 3. Read the three scales to determine the values of the masses that were moved to the right. Their combined mass is equal to the mass of the object. The Figure 1.2 is an enlarged version of the scales of the triple beam balance in Figure 1.1. It allows you to read the scales. The middle scale, which measures the largest movable mass, reads 300 grams. This is followed by the top scale, which reads 30 grams. The bottom scale reads 5.1 grams. Therefore, the mass of the object in the pan is 335.1 grams (300 grams + 30 grams + 5.1 grams). Q: What is the maximum mass this triple beam balance can measure? A: The maximum mass it can measure is 610 grams (500 grams + 100 grams + 10 grams). Q: What is the smallest mass this triple beam balance can measure? A: The smallest mass it can measure is one-tenth (0.1) of a gram. To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like the one in the Figure 1.3.
